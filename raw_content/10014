<p>So, we&#8217;re writing a cookbook (if you missed our recent post entitled &#8220;We&#8217;re writing a cookbook&#8221;) and like anything else on this blog, how could we possible undertake such an important, mind-fuck of an endeavor without getting some feedback from our online friends? We would never EVER. So we sent out some inter-office envelopes through the U.S. Postal Service, and an email to special dudes in other parts of the world, and the feedback is coming back! We&#8217;ve gotten long emails, video responses and even long phone calls. Everything from grammar corrections to reminders that not everyone can find Westvletteren 12 for their beer pairing (not that we&#8217;d ever change that). Check out below the first round of recipe testers for &#8220;Salad Daze.&#8221; Thanks dudes.</p>

<p><strong>Portobello Poutine</strong><br />
Testers: Mike and Curt Merrill<br />
Location: Atlanta, GA<br />
Website: <a href="www.kmikeym.com/">kMikeym.com</a><br />
Beer pairing: Unibrou Maudite<br />
Soundtrack: Leonard Cohen, &#8220;The Future&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong> &#8220;The recipe was broken into three parts and I was worried about it being complicated, but it turned out that the shopping was the hardest part. Also it helped that I mostly drank the leftover sherry and Curt did most of the cooking.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Belgian Onion Soup</strong><br />
Tester: Molly Rodgveller<br />
Location: Ghent, Belgium<br />
Blog: <a href="existentialmedia.org/right">I Know, Right?</a><br />
Beer pairing: De Proef, Flemish Primitive Wild Ale<br />
Soundtrack: Metal Urbaine, Hysterie Connective</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong> &#8220;I had to add like 2 extra cups of water to the soup to make it into soup rather than sauce&#8230;  I&#8217;d say you could serve 8 with it as a starter or 6 as a meal. Soup was ab fab. liquid gold. Out of curiosity, which De Proef did you drink with it? I am not far from Lochristi, where they make it, and I wouldn&#8217;t mind going and checking the place out. As an aside, I went to the brewery of the gueuze that I brought back for you guys the other day and picked up 9 750ml bottles for 22 bucks (3 gueuze, 3 kriek, 3 faro). I&#8217;m storing them in the cellar for summer. But the awesome thing is, they sell a 5 liter bag in a box of fresh lambic for 20 euros. I know, right?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Magic Shroom Dust</strong><br />
Testers: the dudes at QuarryGirl<br />
Location: West L.A.<br />
Blog:<a href="www.quarrygirl.com/"> quarrygirl.com</a><br />
Beer pairing: Goose Island Bourbon County Stout<br />
Soundtrack: Umberto, &#8220;Someone Chasing Someone Through a House&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong> &#8220;The whole dish was ridiculously easy to prepare, although through the entire process we failed to see how the thing could possible be bacon-esque. I mean, mushrooms and PUMPKIN SEEDS were the base? Half-way through the preparation we began to wonder if Evan and Alex had been doing a bit of real ‘shroom dust themselves… VOILA! A crunchy, bacony surprise waited for us right there in the pan. It was brown, crispy and perfectly tasty. In fact, we started to eat right away straight from the pan&#8230; there seems no end to the versatility of the Shroom Dust – it really is magic!&#8221;</p>

<p>About five years ago—on April 5, 2006—we told you how to make <a href="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/2006/04/">a psychotropic pizza</a> then dictated it must be paired with a pint of Flying Dog Gonzo Imperial Porter and Jefferson Airplane’s “Surrealistic Pillow” album. Was that the first time a food web log suggested that one dish, a certain beer and a particular vinyl L.P. be consumed together? Maybe not…but maybe so. </p>
<p>Although it’s now a ubiquitous online pastime, pairing music with our culinary conquests seemed, at the time, a weird, funny, and a little show-offy, but nonetheless helpful service we could offer anyone hunting for ideas. Even if not the first, it’s certainly possible we were just one of a handful of bloggers that came up with this idea in our sous vide vacuum; a convergent evolution sorta thing. It&#8217;s a relatively obvious concept, after all, just a flighty fun twist on pairings, right?</p>
<p>Actually, no. The bottom line is that those other nerds are doing this all wrong. <a href="http://functionalbeer.com/2010/04/28/music-and-beer-pairing-what/">Wrong</a>. <a href="http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-11-02/wine/17268771_1_wine-napa-valley-cabernet-micro-oxygenation.">Wrong </a>. <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/478955">Hahahaha</a>. Ahhhhhhhhh, <a href="http://www.turntablekitchen.com/about/">so wrong</a>. It’s not their taste in music or even that they’re “big cabs” and “oaky chardonnays” blow. It’s that they’re under the impression this is some sort of artistic expression. </p>
<p>This is science. This is not for amateurs. We take this very seriously. We have methods. </p>

<p>We’ve no beef with practitioners of the oldest profession — it’s the second oldest we worry about. Middlemen. </p>
<p>Middlemen lie to you. Exploit your weakness. They tax your tea, charge overhead, and tell you only they can talk to god. They — in a word — blow. Which is why we <a href="http://vimeo.com/9805030">don’t buy cheese at Trader Joe’s</a>, don’t ever get spices at the supermarket, avoid gourmet stores for anything we could get at a health food store’s bulk bins, and why we plan on telling our (future) offspring to never… ever… pay someone else to score them drugs. </p>
<p>You know who agrees with us? Sierra Nevada. The West Coast king of hops is leading by example with their new brew, Hoptimum, an imperial IPA brewed with a mouthful of whole cone hops grown by them and only them on their vast Chico estate. Given the ratcheting up of hop prices, this is a smart business move, a little like drilling for oil in your own borders, but we appreciate it as more for than just a dollar-and-cents move. Total. Control. DIY. Drink it yourself…</p>
<p>Can these guys grow? Granted, we’ve never sown our own whole cone hops to compare but from where we sit (on our asses, on the porch, watching the sunlight refract through this wispy redheaded wonder tonic while filming a blog video that involves Alex’s glasses upside down and burning sage) they grow just fine. It’s a satisfyingly fat, olive-green bottle on our laps and when we lasso the neck to pop its top with a chef’s knife it’s almost as if we shrank and we’re holding a normal-sized Sierra Nevada Pale Ale that feels bigger. Head is ‘whatever,’ colors just fine. But the smell is siiiick. Stinging sweet red swizzle stick lit on fire and doused in holy water. A well-groomed skunk, slicked with garden musk. We lick the skunk; it licks back. Whether it’s the extrajudicial knowledge that this is god damn grade A, homegrown brewery produce we’re drinking here, or just good hops, this floral juice is sweeter and spicier than we can ever remember any other Sierra Nevada, even other anniversary ales from Chico, tasting. Now, if only we can cut out this pesky middleman of a bottle in our way, and drink standing in their garden.</p>

<p>Aztec party animals got dowwwn. And their parties usually meant one thing—a stew of corn kernels simmered with freshly plucked human flesh.</p>
<p>Word is, this combo came from their totally-high-on-blood belief that their god fashioned humans out of corn meal, and an early ‘snout-to-table’ attitude to not waste the still-beating heart of the lucky dudes they murdered on top of their temples (“Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” style). Then, when their new Spanish god said to stop partying so hard, they just subbed pig meat (weak).</p>
<p>In keeping with the idea that ritual sacrifice makes you stronger, we just gave up four long hours of our life to make this pozole of spiced hominy, fire-roasted peppers, and cool tomatillo crema. While it’s a doozy of a laundry list, there’s no human, or pig, flesh. Instead we squeeze that blood-and-iron taste from some earthy dried chiles, toasted spices, coffee and citrus. After waiting several hours for the dried corn to plump, we started wondering if the stuff really is vegetal, cuz it was acting like dry bones. Humans made out of corn meal, now that’s a religious concept; our next project is to re-dehydrate these flavored kernels to fry up some human corn nuts. </p>
<p><a href="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/files/2011/02/poz.jpg"><img src="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/files/2011/02/poz.jpg" alt="" title="poz" width="250" height="188" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1380" /></a></p>
<p><em>(Serves 10-12)</em><br />
<strong>Corn</strong><br />
3 cups corn kernels (dried hominy style)<br />
3 chipotle peppers (in adobo)<br />
10 cups vegetable stock<br />
1 small bulb ginger, peeled<br />
1 fresh lime</p>
<p><strong>Broth</strong><br />
2 Tbs. grapeseed oil<br />
1 celery stalk<br />
1 white onion<br />
1 carrot<br />
a handful dried red chiles (New Mexico)<br />
2 tsp. cumin seed<br />
2 tsp. coriander<br />
1 tsp. coffee<br />
1 orange bell pepper<br />
1 jalapeno pepper<br />
1 Navel orange<br />
3 cloves garlic<br />
1 whole clove<br />
2 tsp. smoked paprika</p>
<p><strong>Garnis</strong>h<br />
4 tomatillos<br />
1 avocado<br />
2 Tbs. <a href="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/2011/01/25/seven-layer-trip/">magic shroom dust</a><br />
2 Tbs. fresh oregano leaves</p>
<p>1. Several hours before, start preparing the pozole corn. Fill a large pot with corn kernels and make a flavored stock to cook ‘em in: Combine 1 cup vegetable stock with the chipotle peppers and pulse together in a blender, then add 4 more cups stock so you have a chipotle broth. Cover the pozole with the broth and set on high heat. Add half the ginger bulb (whole) and a squeeze of lime.</p>
<p>2. Once you hit a boil, set this pot on simmer and cook for about two hours. The corn should swell and become chewy rather than brittle.</p>
<p>3. When the corn is soft and nearly done, start preparing the rest of the soup. First, place the dried red chiles in a tall bowl and cover with 2 cups hot water to soften. Chop the celery, onion, carrot and remaining ginger for mirepoix and set aside. Toast the cumin and coriander seed briefly in a pan and set aside. Char your bell pepper and jalapeno by sitting on direct heat on your stove, flipping every couple minutes until skin is blackened. Sit these in a tuperware or paper bag for several minutes, then peel charred skin off by hand, remove seeds and chop the bell, mince the jalapeno.</p>
<p>4. Before proceeding, zest the rest of your lime, and the entire navel orange, set the zest and fruit aside.</p>
<p>5. In a second pot, add 1 tablespoon of grapeseed oil followed by the mirepoix. Saute and stir this for several minutes. Then add bell pepper and keep stirring. Take the rehydrated red chiles and pulse in the blender with one whole clove to make a deep red broth (add only as much of the water as needed to move). To this, add the garlic, toasted spices, coffee, smoked paprika and remaining 5 cups of vegetable stock and stir. Add this broth to the soup pot and set on medium-high heat to reach a boil. Once boil is attained, add the juice of the orange. Stir and keep cooking.</p>
<p>6. Finally, strain the now-soft corn kernels and add to the soup pot. Cook together for another 30 minutes to an hour on low heat, stirring every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>7. In the meantime, roast tomatillos for the avocado-salsa garnish. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees. Cover a tray or cassoulet with aluminum foil sprayed or greased with oil and add tomatillos (skin on), bending the foil to cover them. Roast in the oven for about 20 minutes or until skins start to blacken and the fruit becomes juicy or even pops. Remove from oven.</p>
<p>8. Puree the roasted tomatillos with one tablespoon of grapeseed oil and two-thirds of the  avocado. Season to taste and remove. Toss in the minced jalapeno.</p>
<p>9. Serve pozole with fresh picked oregano leaves as garnish, a dollop of avocado cream and sliced avo as well as a healthy sprinkle of magic shroom dust for salty protein vibes.</p>

<p>Marvel at our sugar galaxy with its cracked nutmeg orb, clove and peppercorn moons, anise stars and wispy blood-orange winds. So goddamn beautiful we can barely bring ourselves to bring the first bite of pancake to our mouth.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is maple syrup &#8212; on crack. It&#8217;s easy, simple enough even legit crack heads could make time for it. And it&#8217;s not too late to enjoy it this winter, be it on a pancake or swirled in a bourbon (bourbon on crack). Even though<em> our</em> world&#8217;s returned to 60-degree and sunny, we know there are some psychos in Vermont eating maple taffy right now &#8212; that delicacy of maple syrup boiled and poured on a casserole dish of packed snow. To them, we say, get high on this.</p>
<p><strong>MULLED MAPLE SYRUP </strong><br />
750 ml-1 liter maple syrup (B Grade)<br />
2 cardamom pods (or 1 tsp. ground)<br />
4 star anise<br />
6-8” cinnamon stick<br />
2 fresh vanilla bean pods scraped<br />
2 tsp peppercorns<br />
1 nutmeg smashed<br />
6 cloves<br />
1 orange peel</p>
<p>1. Dump the syrup into a heavy bottomed pot and add all spices. Save the bottle for later use.</p>
<p>2. Using a pairing knife, peel the orange, creating several large pieces of peel and add it to the pot (save the fruit for eating).</p>
<p>3. Place pot on a low heat for 2-3 hours, checking on it every 30 minutes to stir and keep from scorching.</p>
<p>4. When you remove from heat, let it cool completely, at least one hour, before returning to the bottle. Using a fine mesh strainer and a funnel, strain the spices out and return to the original bottle. Keeps forever.</p>

<p>Come late January, we’ll occasionally perk our ears to talk of “super bowl this, super bowl that.” It has something to do with sports, that much we get (we’re not aware of any games) but more importantly, it’s become a glutinous food holiday for much of America, and that we can get behind! Now, our contribution &#8212; seven layers of beans, beer, market produce, molten dairy, spice, herbs and crunchy protein. It’s less a “dip” and more of a trip &#8212; as in LSD &#8212; and we’re still undecided as to whether it’s a good one or bad one. See, we started off calling this monstrousity “seven layers in heaven” but quickly nicknamed it “seven layers of hell” (if you make too much and are cursed with leftovers, you will understand). </p>
<p>Imagine Dante’s rings of hell built out of refried beer beans, chile-cheese Mornay sauce, roasted salsa, avocado-citrus salad, homemade creme fraiche, a bacony dust of pumpkin seeds and a veritable astro-turf of scallion and cilantro. Enjoy the descent!</p>
<p><strong>Refried Beans</strong><br />
1/2 lbs. dried pinto beans<br />
2-3 cups vegetable stock<br />
1 Tbs. grapeseed oil<br />
1 medium yellow onion, chopped<br />
2 cloves garlic, minced<br />
6 chipotle peppers in Adobo Sauce<br />
½ cup pale ale<br />
salt to taste</p>
<p>1. Make the beans the night before. Bring a large pot filled with the beans and stock to a boil (you need slightly less than double stock to bean ratio) then lower to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes to an hour, or until beans are fork tender. Remove from heat and let sit.</p>
<p>2. In a smaller pot on high heat add the grapeseed oil, then the onion and garlic, stirring to keep from burning. Remove the chipotle peppers from their can, roughly chop and add (with sauce) to the pot. Follow with the beer, give a good stir and add cooked beans without stock (reserve for later). Cook this about 10 minutes, just enough for the beer to reduce a bit and remove from heat. Let cool while you make the cheese sauce.</p>
<p><strong>Chile Cheese Sauce</strong><br />
3 Fresno chiles<br />
2 Tbs. butter<br />
2 Tbs. all-purpose flour<br />
2 cups organic milk<br />
8 oz. white cheddar (grated)<br />
1 Tbs. Louisiana hot sauce<br />
1 tsp. turmeric powder<br />
salt to taste</p>
<p>3. Burn the chiles directly on your stove top until blackened, then place in a paper bag or tupperware for 5 minutes in order to sweat the skins off. Flake off all black bits and remove seeds, then slice into matchsticks and then turn to chop into a fine dice. </p>
<p>4. Put a heavy bottomed pot on medium heat, add butter and let cook until bubbly, then add flour and stir well. Once it starts to slightly brown, add milk, stir or whisk well and let continue to cook several minutes. Once you hit a rolling boil turn to a simmer and add grated cheddar in stages, stirring all the while. Add hot sauce, turmeric and salt to taste. Remove from heat and cool.</p>
<p>5. Puree the refried beans in a food processor or using a handheld mixer. Use some but not all of the beer liquid to blend, if still dry add a tablespoon at a time of stock until its creamy. Store both cheese sauce and beans in fridge for at least two hours, or overnight.</p>
<p><a href="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/files/2011/01/dust.jpg"><img src="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/files/2011/01/dust.jpg" alt="" title="dust" width="250" height="188" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1358" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Magic Shroom Dust</strong><br />
1/2 lbs. oyster mushrooms<br />
1 cup raw pepitas<br />
2 tsp. grapeseed oil<br />
1 tsp. smoked salt<br />
1/2 tsp. smoked paprika<br />
1/2 tsp. black pepper<br />
1/2 tsp. maple syrup<br />
canola spray</p>
<p>6. You can make magic mushroom dust the day before as well. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees. Tear the oyster mushrooms into long lengthwise shreds, so that each piece runs from mushroom cap to the woodier stem, and place in a mixing bowl.Toss the mushrooms with olive oil, smoked salt, black pepper, paprika and maple syrup. Spray a baking sheet with canola oil and lay mushrooms out evenly over it, spraying the mushrooms themselves as well. Cook in the oven for 10-12 minutes or until brown and crispy.</p>
<p>7. In a large skillet, toast the pepitas on medium-high heat, tossing every couple minutes to cook evenly. Salt to taste and remove from heat.</p>
<p>8. Cool both mushrooms and pepitas until room temperature. Combine and pulse in a food processor in several quick cycles. You want a crumb consistency but so fine as to be dust. Bigger chunks are OK.</p>
<p>9. Return to baking sheet, evenly distributed and sprayed with canola oil, return to oven for another 5-10 minutes or until dry. Store the cool, dry, crumbs in the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>Salsa</strong><br />
2 medium hot house tomatoes<br />
1 jalapeno pepper, diced<br />
1/2 a lemon<br />
1 tsp. olive oil</p>
<p><strong>Avocado Salad</strong><br />
2 ripe Haas avocados<br />
1/2 a mandarin&#8211;juiced and zested<br />
1/2 a lemon&#8211;juiced and zested<br />
1 Tbs. olive oil<br />
Salt and pepper to taste</p>
<p><a href="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/files/2011/01/dip2.jpg"><img src="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/files/2011/01/dip2.jpg" alt="" title="dip2" width="250" height="188" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1359" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Other Toppings</strong><br />
½ cup Creme Fraiche<br />
3 green onions<br />
1 cup cilantro leaves<br />
1/2 cup parsley leaves</p>
<p>10. On game day: Remove your cheese sauce, refried beans and magic mushroom dust from fridge to warm enough to be easier to work with. </p>
<p>11. Make a simple pico de gallo, dicing tomatoes and jalapeno and mixing with a squeeze of lemon and olive oil. Season as desired. Set aside.</p>
<p>11. Slice avocados lengthwise and then width-wise, leaving one-inch long slices, do so delicately (don’t mash, this isn’t guac) and add to a mixing bowl with the juice and zests of your citruses, olive oil and salt and pepper.</p>
<p>12. Finely chop the green onion, cilantro and parsley.</p>
<p>13. Assemble by delicately stuffing either a shaped cutter (a cookie cutter, ring mold or a pie mold work well) with your desired amount of each layer going from beans, to cheese sauce, to salsa, to avocado salad, creme fraiche, mushroom dust, greens. Serve on a large plate with fresh tortilla chips.</p>

<p>Cold winter months are for hibernating. And marinating. And mascerating, reconstituting, leavening, braising&#8230;We spend so much time hunkered down in our kitchens during  winter we sometimes forget to exercise at all. (Unless flexing our abdomens on the way to the fridge counts, which it doesn’t.)</p>
<p>This seasonal sloth, combined with so much time spent with family (read “gorging” and “binge drinking”) carves a deadly path toward the January jiggles. So after some tough-love nagging from our <a href="http://vimeo.com/330435">lady friends</a>, Hot Knives has developed a comprehensive kitchen workout regimen. </p>
<p>Designed to keep you toned and buff even while you mash humongous pots of coconut oil-mashed potatoes and bourbon gravy, this soon-to-be patented exercise program is cheap and easy. Forget gym membership dues or special equipment. The Hot Knives workout can be completed any time, rain or shine, in the privacy of your own kitchen, and without skipping dinner! Follow along to these easy step-by-step instructions or watch the workout video above&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Canvas Curls</strong>: After a trip to your favorite farmers market, simply lift your canvas bags filled with heavy vegetables in 10-20 repeatable arm curls. Keep your back straight, perform equally among both arms. </p>
<p><strong>Liver Lifts:</strong> This move requires a workout partner and is best performed after a beer run because it requires a 12-pack of beer bottles (12-oz craft beer preferred). Stand back to back and pass the box from left to right. Focus on your form, and feel the burn around your spare tire.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Man Skillets:</strong> These curls can be performed with one or two cast iron skillets. Grabbing the handle of each skillet, curl your arm upwards and back down slowly, repeating 10-20 times. To hit additional muscle groups try bringing pans out sideways from your hips, and up over your head. <strong>Extra credit:</strong> Place the weights over high heat, and one pound of nuts for extra weight, and lift every 10 seconds for a thorough back-and-forth shake.</p>
<p><strong>Pot Squats:</strong> Fill the largest pot you own with water. Keeping your back straight and the pot held with your elbows to your side, squat 6 or so inches toward the ground and back up. Repeat 20 times or until you fall over. <strong>Extra credit</strong>: fill the pot with 10 pounds of cubed potatoes and repeat.</p>
<p><strong>The Juicer:</strong> Sometimes it’s all about form. Small, subtle movements work your muscles with the right attention in this move. Cutting through a Valencia orange. Placing it on your juicer. And pulling down on the lever with authority and style. This is a workout that really rewards &#8212; with a refreshing fruit juice finish!</p>
<p><strong>Blue Cheese Tabletop Push-ups:</strong> On a butcher block table, countertop, or other prep surface place a plate of Stilton. Assume the push-up position with your face directly above the cheese. Perform 10 push-ups smelling the cheese as incentive to continue, with the option of licking the cheese on each downward completion. The beauty of this move is that the blue cheese works as an incentive whether you love blue cheese (encouraging each downward position) or hate it (forcing you to push away from the stench). This move can be made vegan by using an alternative food. We prefer a bowl of kimche or homemade sauerkraut.</p>
<p><strong>The Put-away:</strong> Perfect for cleaning up while you slim down. Assemble all your clean dishes on a flat surface behind you. Establish which upper cupboard you’re focusing on and then perform a twist, grab and turn maneuver, focusing on your lower back and sides. Step up and put the dish away.</p>
<p><strong>Saran Steamer:</strong><em> Warning, this move is not for the faint of heart.</em> Wrap your entire body, including your arms and legs, in industrial-strength saran wrap. This will induce a sauna-like effect because your skin can’t breathe, increasing the amount of sweat. Jog in place for 10 minutes to your favorite punk song. <strong>Extra credit:</strong> break a beer bottle on the floor followed by one jar of peanut butter and roll in it like you’re Iggy Pop.</p>

<p>Having no god and preferring few gifts, all we have is food when it comes to the holy days of winter. And so we tend to rev our ovens with reckless abandon. But if there’s just one complaint we have with Thanksgiving and Christmas cooking, it’s the general lack of hot sauce. Fruit cake spices replace spice. The only thing resembling red on your plate is cranberry gloop. And sloshing Sriracha, Tapatio or Frank’s Red Hot all over a 4-hour gravy seems sacrilege. We&#8217;ve tried before to insert hot sauce into the holidays, to various <a href="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/2008/12/31/holy_mole_chocolate_tomatoes/">mixed</a> awesome <a href="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/2008/01/08/white_widows/">results</a>.</p>
<p>This year, we solved our sauce dilemma once and for all: Holiday harissa. We started with a base of our beer-braised cranberry sauce, which we perfected this year. Then we made it hot. Blended with a slew of roasted chiles, it comes out slightly sweet, very tart, and spruced with a subtle clove essence. One part sweet-inducing sting, one-part chai spice tongue comforter. The best part? If you make the cranberry sauce but get too lazy to roast a buttload of chiles, blend the amount  you would have used (1 cup) with equal parts gin, spritz with champagne and garnish with a lime wedge and you have something that actually helps you survive a holiday with family.</p>
<p><strong>Cranberry Sauce</strong><br />
<em>(Makes about 4 cups)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/files/2010/12/cran2.jpg"><img src="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/files/2010/12/cran2.jpg" alt="" title="cran2" width="188" height="250" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1331" /></a></p>
<p>1 bag cranberries (12 oz.)<br />
2 1/2 cups Lindemann’s cherry kriek<br />
1 cup Belgian candi syrup (brown sugar works)<br />
1 cinnamon stick<br />
zest of one orange<br />
1 tsp. fresh grated ginger<br />
½ tsp. salt</p>
<p>1. Place cranberries in a pot and cover with kriek, stir in candi syrup. Add cinnamon stick, orange zest, ginger and salt. Place on medium heat and let cook until mixture hits a rolling boil. Place on simmer and let cook another 10 minutes.</p>
<p>2. Mixture should be gooey, cranberries should have burst. Taste and sweeten more if desired. Remove from heat and cool.</p>
<p><strong>Winter Harissa</strong><br />
<em>(Makes 4 cups)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/files/2010/12/cran3.jpg"><img src="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/files/2010/12/cran3.jpg" alt="" title="cran3" width="188" height="250" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1337" /></a></p>
<p>12 dried large red chiles (California or New Mexico)<br />
6 fresh jalapenos<br />
6 yellow wax peppers<br />
2 pasilla peppers<br />
1 cup cranberry sauce<br />
1/2 cup cider vinegar<br />
1/2 cup olive oil<br />
1 Tbs. kosher salt<br />
1 tsp. clove</p>
<p>1. Pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees while you deal with the chiles. Wearing gloves, slice open the dry chiles and place in a large bowl. Cover with a cup of warm water to re-hydrate.</p>
<p>2. Slice the jalapenos, wax peppers and pasillas and remove the seeds. Place chiles in a bowl and spray with canola oil, dump onto a sheet pan and shove into oven. Roast for about 20-30 minutes, until outer peppers start to blacken. Remove and let cool.</p>
<p>3. In a food processor, pulse the rehydrated red chiles, the roasted peppers and cranberry sauce. Slowly add vinegar and olive oil. Continue to blend for at least a minute to guarantee creamy consistency. If it appears goopy, add the leftover red chile water one tablespoon at a time. Add salt and spices and pulse some more.</p>
<p>4. Remove and store in the refrigerator. Harissa will keep for weeks.</p>

<p>Caffeine + alcohol + teenage hormones = 911</p>
<p>If that sounds like the bull-shittery of a D.A.R.E. lesson, uh-uh, watch <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/10/25/2010-10-25_four_loco_not_date_rape_drugs_hospitalized_9_students_at_one_party_at_washington.html">the news headlines</a> that the “blackout in a can,” beverage Four Loko, which we’ve never tried, has college kids passing out naked together mid-grope at parties in their front lawns, unconscious in cars, getting found by cops in these various states of compromised<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVWWre8tn_U"> fuck-up-edness</a>, and ultimately sent tripping to the emergency room with their hearts beating out of their chests. The timeless tradition of uppers plus downers made more convenient. Speedy coma. Sleepy foam party. Forget the ‘turn on, tune in, drop out’ maxim. It’s all, ‘rock-out, throw up, pass-out.’</p>
<p>If there’s one bit of advice we would give today’s youth about this nasty shit, it’d be this: Ditch the cranberry-lemonade flavor, kids! We say either go hard – snort an 8-ball with a smack chaser &#8211; or go classy – take your booze with coffee!</p>
<p>Whereas Europeans have been mixing their drugs for centuries to great effect (wine + cognac + espresso = dinner), we Americans have trouble getting the equation just right. So we can sympathize. It took us a while to figure out how to combine uppers and downers too. <a href="http://urbanhonking.com/hotknives/files/2010/11/oxy.jpg">And most of our own experiments were also in dorm rooms</a>. Lab trials like replacing water in a hooka pipe with peppermint shnapps (side effects: light headedness and coughing fits), or bringing tallboys of peach corn syrup-flavored Arizona Ice Tea spiked with vodka to classes (headaches, dizziness, ill-advised hand-raising to professors’ questions). </p>
<p>But currently, there’s nothing we’d rather pass out with our pants off to than the beer aptly called <strong>Stimulus</strong>, a coffee-infused Belgian-pale-pretty crafted by our local Eagle Rock Brewery. Bucking the trend that says coffee-tinged malt must be a stout, porter or other cocoa-colored “dark” beer, this is less predictable and far more cerebrally exciting. </p>
<p>The amber wavvy brew is all Tuscan-sun gold with a crisp cumulous-white lacing. Served in a real pint, it’s a beautiful thing – a venti latte of malted grain booze head-rush cool-down. Stimulus tastes on your tongue the way it feels to snake a coveted sidewalk spot at your busy coffee shop, with a tasty, white-ceramic and lemon-garnished shot of foamy espresso in your hands, on a sunny 75-degree Saturday. It starts off numby on your gums and smells more like fresh milk than coffee. Wafts of sweet grassy hops help mask the bitter brown bean-cream, in this case the roast comes from a certain Chicago mob of barista-nistas, not our favorite, but a strong, oily and soily bean to be sure.  Halfway through though, all we taste is the sweet sweet caffeine.</p>
<p>Have two, have three. Take your pants off. Turn the lights out, you’ll be fine.</p>
