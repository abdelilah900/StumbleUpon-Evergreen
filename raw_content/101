Orange too. But yellow is one of the colors I can surround myself in and feel happy with. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t always go well with my complexion. Over the past few years, colored jeans have really come into their own. I&#8217;ve been wearing a pair of green jeans for a while, and have a pair of orange ones, but this<a href="http://www.shopbop.com/811-mid-rise-skinny-jeans/vp/v=1/845524441922716.htm?folderID=2534374302155271&amp;fm=browse-brand-shopbysize-viewall&amp;colorId=18929" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.shopbop.com']);"> pastel yellow by J Brand</a> is easily one of my favorites. It pretty much goes with everything, and makes every outfit happy.  Not to mention the stretchy twill is super comfortable, making this pair of jeans a staple in my weekly rotation.</p>
<p>Here I&#8217;ve paired it with my turqoise Ariztia silk blouse and a standard black blazer with vintage pumps. It probably falls in the color blocking trend, though I&#8217;m afraid of color blocking being &#8220;so 2011&#8243; oh well, it&#8217;s easy. Today I had a meeting and had to look somewhat presentable and blazers always make every outfit look dressed up, even if it&#8217;s with a cheery pair of yellow jeans.</p>

Meaning, I can barely do my own hair in a ponytail. I also have very fine hair, so the topknots just point out the super fine strands. Lately, I&#8217;ve been seeing these hair donuts around, wondering what they could be used for, and after going to London, and having flat iron issues, I just said to heck with it and took a chance on the hair donut, and see if it a simpleton such as myself could figure it out.</p>
<p>Low and behold, even with no instructions, figuring out the sock bun was super easy, and it took only a few seconds! Here is how to do it, and once you try it, you&#8217;ll notice that if you can put your hair in a ponytail, you can do a sock bun!</p>
<h2><strong>Sock bun tutorial in 5 Easy Steps:<a href="http://the-coveted.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/sockbun_tutorial1.jpg" ><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17395" title="sockbun_tutorial" src="http://the-coveted.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/sockbun_tutorial1.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="1500" /></a></strong></h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll need: One hair donut, two hair bands, a comb or brush, and some bobby pins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;">Put your hair in a ponytail</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Thread your ponytail through the hair donut</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Smooth your hair over the hair donut, distributing your hair evenly</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Put a second hair band over the hair donut</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Pin the extra hair around the bun</li>
</ol>
<p>And you&#8217;re done! See that was easy!

While fashion week is certainly not the place for body acceptance, it&#8217;s interesting to see when designers quit literally take on the curves of human form. Antonio Berardi, supported by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/peroniusa" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.facebook.com']);">Peroni Nastro Azzurro</a>,  debuted his winter collection, that paid homage to rococo and the human form, he says, &#8220;I want to give the impression of curves without cutting into the body.&#8221; The literal curves mixed with geometric sequins, tailored into the gowns, the peplums creating a more hourglass shape along with Matisse like cut out shapes on the backs of coats. It all was quite lovely, modern and very lady like.</p>

The only real unicorn I like is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5im0Ssyyus" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">Charley the Unicorn</a> (poor guy). I also like the unicorn in <em>Legend</em>, which is also the only Tom Cruise film I like. However, over the past few years, I&#8217;ve come to be quite the perfume lover. Once I started exploring boutique perfumes there is a whole world out there aside from Clinique Happy. During my <a href="http://facebook.com/peroniusa" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://facebook.com']);">Peroni</a>/LFW trip, I didn&#8217;t have much time to explore shopping, but I did want to stop by Penhaligon&#8217;s a perfumer since 1870, it had the charm of a turn of the 19th century shop mixed with beautiful sophisticated, and sometimes historic scents.</p>
<p><a href="http://the-coveted.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/penhaglions_solidperfume.jpg" ><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17371" title="penhaglions_solidperfume" src="http://the-coveted.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/penhaglions_solidperfume.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>One of the perfumes that really stood out was the <a href="http://www.penhaligons.com/shop/fragrance/shop-by-fragrance/artemisia/artemisia-eau-de-parfum-50ml-496882.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.penhaligons.com']);">Artemisia</a>, which has lilly of the valley, violet and jasmine with amber and vanilla, in the perfect mixture that is subtle, not too girly but feminine. Which is odd because the perfume has unicorns all over it. Then again, there&#8217;s a lot of unicorns in the UK. They have them on their passports and they&#8217;re all around, so maybe they&#8217;re not so pansy there as they are stateside. I did like adding the pretty bottle with the pink bow to vanity. The solid perfume had the embossed logo, which maybe aside from the sophisticated smell, the unicorns really sold me on a subliminal level.</p>
<p>So there you go. Unicorns.

You know, cups of tea in beautiful China teacups and dainty sandwiches. But in reality, it&#8217;s PG tips and a packaged sandwich in a triangle box from Tesco, which I&#8217;ve grown to love with all sincerity. Downton Abbey has recently swept us off our feet stateside (I&#8217;ve become obsessed), and when <a href="http://www.facebook.com/peroniusa" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.facebook.com']);">Peroni</a> sent me over to cover LFW, I kind of wanted to see if that England existed anywhere. Daks, the heritage brand we don&#8217;t hear much of in the US, actually had been around for over 130 years, it has a modern, minimalistic feel to it, yet strongly ties into the past. While I was watching the show, I kept thinking that maybe subliminally Downton Abbey had gotten into their system as well, as they played with chiffon overlayed cocktail dresses, dropwaisted cocktail dresses with opulent fabric, and a basic red pant with button up that was the 21st century answer to Mary&#8217;s red skirt and white blouse I had coveted at first sight.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s one of those things where you look out for red cars, and all you see is how many red cars there are out there, but I really felt that this collection gave hope that the fancy tea-drinking  proper England existed somewhere. <a href="http://the-coveted.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/downtonabbey.jpg" ><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17356" title="downtonabbey" src="http://the-coveted.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/downtonabbey.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="900" /></a></p>

<div id="wp_fb_like_button" style="margin:5px 0 5px 5px;float:right;height:50px;"><script src="http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1"></script><fb:like href="http%3A%2F%2Fthe-coveted.com%2Fblog%2F2012%2F02%2F16%2Fkiehls-at-home-peel-microdermabrasion%2F" send="false" layout="button_count" width="100" show_faces="true" font="arial" action="like" colorscheme="light"></fb:like></div><p>Over the years I&#8217;ve become increasingly obsessed with skincare, especially with somehow magically getting the super smooth porcelain-like skin.  My dermatologist says that&#8217;s probably not going to happen without some experimental laser treatments that cost a lot of money and would require maintenance.  Because I&#8217;m not loaded, nor am I willing to laser my face quite yet, I&#8217;m getting more into being diligent about my skincare routine.</p>
<p>Peels  and microderm-abrasions basically do the same thing. They help remove dead skin cells, and keep your pores clean, giving them a smaller apperance. I had done some experimenting with TCA peels, and of course going to the spa to get a lactic acid peel, all with good results. The TCA peel worked out ok, but it required recovery time, and spa peels are gentler, but require going to the spa.</p>
<p>Keilh&#8217;s had sent over a few at-home versions for me to try out. Of course, I was thrilled, as I often  scour the boards at Makeup Alley, looking for that magic product that will give me the smoothest skin.  <a href="http://www.kiehls.com/Over-Night-Biological-Peel/630,default,pd.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.kiehls.com']);">Kiehl&#8217;s Overnight Biological Peel</a> and <a href="http://www.kiehls.com/Epidermal-Re-Texturizing-Micro-Dermabrasion/597,default,pd.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.kiehls.com']);">Epidermal Retexturizing Microdermabrasion</a> both do the same thing (essentially) but in very different ways, so I checked them out to see how they compaired to some of the more bold experiments I&#8217;ve been doing lately.</p>
<p><strong>Kiehl&#8217;s Overnight Biological Peel</strong>: This peel utilizes natural enzymes to give a very gentle peel, coupled with hydrating ingredients that work with your body&#8217;s natural regeneration while you sleep. A treatment you can use up to three times a week, you put it on after you cleanse your skin at night and wake up with a fresh face in the morning. I was actually amazed the first time I tried this as my skin, usually dry and pillowfaced was glowing and supple in the morning after use. I tried to use it the three times a week, but I often get scared of straying from my normal heavy duty moisturizers at night. Once a week gives a good effect as it&#8217;s gentle, I&#8217;d like to give this more time. However I&#8217;m happy to recommend, as I continue to use it!</p>
<p><strong>Epidermal Retexturizing Microdermabrasion</strong>- My esthetician recommends that I do not get microdermabrasions due to some broken capillaries, but when I&#8217;m in a pinch, an exfoliator really makes a big difference. When I first tried this, my first thoughts were, &#8220;It feels like sand&#8221; That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s made from ocean sand&#8230; but it also really works. As much as I like the microdermabrasion, I&#8217;m not sure how much it difference it has from regular facial scrubs, but I can say the sand grains are finer than anything else I&#8217;ve tried. I keep this in my shower and use about once a week for those days when my pillowface is particularly lackluster.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to add these products to my skincare routine, as they do help keep up appearances between spa visits. And maybe who knows, maybe one day my skin will be porcelain smooth.

Oddly enough, while much of my life occurs online, I haven&#8217;t really been so personal on the blogs.  I&#8217;ve been thinking about this for some time, and wondered if it were appropriate to change directions on this site.</p>
<p>It seems though that over the last five years of being hyper focused on creating a business with my blogs, I&#8217;ve lost the sense of balance.</p>
<p>The thing is, the modern woman comes across a lot of challenges, wanting to have an amazing career, an amazing family, an amazing life. While I&#8217;d like to say any of that just comes naturally or easy, it really hasn&#8217;t been the case for me. I&#8217;m a slow learner, and tend to like to learn things the hard way. Hence it&#8217;s easy to get caught up chasing after one dream at the expense of the other dreams. I&#8217;m the obsessive type who just gets hell bent on finding happiness in one particular thing. Being thin, (didn&#8217;t make me happy) success (happy for a minute) having a relationship (he makes me happy, but I&#8217;m still crazy) having an amazing job (still need to improve). It&#8217;s just hard to see the big picture with that personality trait. It&#8217;s also hard to let go a little for fear of falling behind.</p>
<p>But in the spirit of learning things the hard way, I&#8217;ve been feeling exhausted with everything that&#8217;s been going on, the non-stop chatter online, the constant stimulation. Was it the sign of burning out? What? I couldn&#8217;t be online 24/7 for the rest of my life?</p>
<p>After taking a step back, it became obvious I wasn&#8217;t so much feeling burned out, but feeling like there was more to life than <em>work</em>. Even if you love what you do, it&#8217;s also important to try new things, to keep things fresh, and I just wasn&#8217;t doing them. I&#8217;m just not doing them now. It&#8217;s important, maybe a yoga class? Lounging around the house on a Sunday afternoon? Meeting up with friends? Trying a new hobby?</p>
<p><strong>So I guess, this is a start of a conversation&#8230; do you struggle with balance in your life? What do you do that gives you the most sense of harmony with everything that&#8217;s going on?</strong></p>

<p>During the winter, a flannel shirt will save your life. Well, it&#8217;s saved mine at least. Maybe not literally, but cozying up with a flannel. As we head into the last few days before fashion week, I&#8217;ve been working a lot, and kind of tired, so that pretty much means jeggings every day. Yeah, they [...]</p>
