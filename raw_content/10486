<div class="entry">
<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2011/04/french-onion-soup/" title="french onion soup"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5266/5598180077_730916e279.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="french onion soup"></a></p>
I&#8217;m firmly of the belief that no matter what ails you in the realm of the kitchen, onion soup can cure it. Never cooked before? Don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be able to pull off the kind of cooking you believe you need to go to a restaurant to experience? Start with onion soup. Have only $5 to spend on dinner? Refrigerator is almost bare? Onion soup is your friend. Want your home to have a transcendent aroma bouncing off every wall, the kind that&#8217;s so distracting that you don&#8217;t even know or care what&#8217;s on the stove, only that you must have it now? Onion soup is waiting for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5598726592/" title="sliced onions, weepy blogger"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5270/5598726592_89d91c56ee.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="sliced onions, weepy blogger"></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5598149437/" title="after 15 minutes heating"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5227/5598149437_0e2e37c310.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="after 15 minutes heating"></a></p>
<p>I realize it was unfair to even make a passing reference to <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2011/04/apple-tarte-tatin-anew/">weepingly delicious onion soup</a> the other day without refreshing it here. I talked up once <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/12/paris-instead/">in 2006</a>, a lifetime ago (or several, if you&#8217;re <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5603511878/">this guy</a>) but it was a very literal recipe from Mastering the Art of French Cooking which benefits from some streamlining. And yet, not <em>too</em> much. Onion soup is a remarkably simple thing to make but when simplified too liberally &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen recipes that instructed you to just caramelize onions for a bit, add stock, cheese etc. &#8212; the nuance that raises it to the transcendent level I&#8217;ve known it to be gets lost. Julia Child&#8217;s original version &#8212; with the very long caramelization of onions that I beg you not to skimp on because this is all the work there really is, the slip of raw grated onion, the cheese within and on top of the soup and starting the croutons toasted hard so they don&#8217;t fall apart in the soup &#8212; raises the soup beyond the everyday, without making it too difficult to whip up almost any day. Which I promise will happen when you realize the staggering gap between effort and outcome that Child&#8217;s onion soup manages to bridge. </p>

<p><b>Onion Soup [Soupe &#224; l’Oignon]</b><br />
Adapted from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375413405/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0375413405">Mastering the Art of French Cooking</a></p>
<p>1 1/2 pounds (680 grams or 24 ounces or about 5 cups) thinly sliced yellow onions<br />
3 tablespoons (42 grams or 1 1/2 ounces) unsalted butter<br />
1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil<br />
1 teaspoon (5 grams) table salt, plus additional to taste<br />
1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) granulated sugar (helps the onions to brown)<br />
3 tablespoons (24 grams or 7/8 ounce) all-purpose flour<br />
2 quarts (8 cups or 1.9 liters) beef or other brown stock*<br />
1/2 cup (118 ml) dry white wine or dry white vermouth<br />
Freshly ground black pepper<br />
3 tablespoons (45 ml) cognac or brandy (optional)</p>
<p><u>To finish [Gratin&#233;e] (Optional)</u><br />
1 tablespoon grated raw onion<br />
1 to 2 cups (to taste) grated Swiss (I often use Gruyere) or a mixture of Swiss and Parmesan cheese<br />
1 tablespoon butter, melted<br />
12 to 16 1-inch thick rounds French bread, toasted until hard</p>
<p>Melt the butter and oil together in the bottom of a 4- to 5-quart saucepan or Dutch oven over moderately low heat. Add the onions, toss to coat them in oil and cover the pot. Reduce the heat to real low and let them slowly steep for 15 minutes. They don&#8217;t need your attention; you can even go check your email.</p>
<p>After 15 minutes, uncover the pot, raise the heat slightly and stir in the salt and sugar. Cook onions, stirring frequently, for 30 to 40 minutes until they have turned an even, deep golden brown. Don&#8217;t skimp on this step, as it will build the complex and intense flavor base that will carry the rest of the soup. Plus, from here on out, it will be a cinch.</p>
<p>After the onions are fully caramelized, sprinkle them with flour and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the wine in full, then stock, a little at a time, stirring between additions. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and simmer partially covered for 30 to 40 more minutes, skimming if needed. Correct seasonings if needed but go easy on the salt as the cheese will add a bit more saltiness and I often accidentally overdo it. Stir in the cognac, if using. I think you should.</p>
<p>Set aside until needed. I find that homemade onion soup is so deeply fragrant and flavor-rich that it can stand alone, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t enjoy the graitin&#233;ed top once in a while. Here&#8217;s how to pull it off:</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 325. Arrange six ovenproof soup bowls or crocks on a large, foil-lined baking sheet. Bring the soup back to a boil and divide among six bowls. To each bowl, add 1/2 teaspoon grated raw onion and a tablespoon of grated cheese. Stir to combine. Dab your croutons with a tiny bit of butter and float a few on top of your soup bowls, attempting to cover it. Mound grated cheese on top of it; how much you use will be up to you. [Julia Child, in another era, felt that 1/2 cup of grated cheese could be divided among 6 bowls. I can assure you that if you'd like your gooey bubbling cheese lid to be anything like what you get at your local French restaurant, you are looking to use more, such as a generous 1/4 cup.]</p>
<p>Bake soups on tray for 20 minutes, then preheat broiler. Finish for a minute or two under the broiler to brown the top lightly. Grab pot holders, and serve immediately.</p>
<p>*  Porcini or mushroom stock are a robust vegetarian substitution.</p>

				<p>Amazing. I was riding the train to work today, thinking, &#8220;I should make onion soup tonight. I wonder how fussy Julia Childs&#8217; recipe is&#8230;&#8221; You have made my weekend.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m making this tonight. In fact, I&#8217;m going to the grocery store to gather ingredients RIGHT NOW.<br />
Thanks for another great weekend recipe idea, Deb!<br />

				<p>Also&#8230;how important is the white wine and beef broth for the full effect? Usually I alternate between red and white and between chicken and beef (whatever&#8217;s on hand). Right now I have chicken broth and red wine&#8230;do I need to go to the store again to transition from &#8220;fairly delicious&#8221; to &#8220;weepingly delicious&#8221;?</p>

				<p>Mary &#8212; I know a lot of people make it with chicken broth. I much, much prefer beef broth, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you won&#8217;t enjoy it either way.</p>

				<p>It is a VERY rare cold, rainy April day here in Phoenix. In short, the weather&#8217;s perfect &#8212; and this soup is exactly what we need to celebrate. It&#8217;s only 10 a.m. but I am heading to the kitchen to make this right now. Thank you for posting!</p>

				<p>dooooooooing it.</p>
<p>this looks so good. i am obsessed with french onion soup and I will go and buy ramekins just to make it so I can melt cheese all over. this also doesn&#8217;t seem too rough to make, which is exciting</p>
<p>a bowl of this is perfection</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t think anything can beat Julia Child&#8217;s recipe. I&#8217;ve made it with both yellow onions and sweet onions, and I actually prefer sweet. Instead of putting the toasted bread and cheese on top of the soup, I make little cheesy toasts and dip them in. I must say, there is no better smell than carmelizing onions!</p>

				<p>Oh my goodness. What do I have on the stove, this very minute? Julia Child&#8217;s onion soup. I popped onto Smitten Kitchen to get the Tarte Tatin from earlier in the week, and there&#8217;s Julia, again. :) Smitten Kitchen never fails me &#8212; the Sally Lunn bread is our new favorite Sunday morning treat.

				<p>I&#8217;ve been making this soup for years. I tend to up the onion somewhat (I like lots of onions). Homemade beef stock is best if you&#8217;ve got the time&#8211;you can really taste the difference between homemade and packaged in a recipe this simple, and I&#8217;ve never found a packaged beef stock that comes close to homemade. I&#8217;ve found fairly decent chicken broth, but not beef. </p>
<p>Also, some restaurants use part mozzarella cheese to get that really gooey, stretchy top. Definitely not traditional, but if you&#8217;re wondering why your cheese doesn&#8217;t come out that gooey, that&#8217;s why.</p>

				<p>This looks amazing! We recently tried Steamy Kitchen&#8217;s Swiss Onion Soup recipe (beer and chicken broth instead of white wine and beef broth), and it was also delicious. Not sure which one we like better &#8211; maybe we should make them both and do a taste test!</p>
<p>In general, I think you can&#8217;t beat the taste (and smell) of onions cooking in butter. One of our friends labeled it one of the Top Ten Deliciousnesses of all time, and I think I have to agree.</p>

				<p>Beautiful and delicious.  It&#8217;s really one of those classic recipes that&#8217;s been around for ages, and when you try it you realize why.<br />
Mushroom stock is a brilliant substitution idea&#8211; I&#8217;ll definitely try that, even though I&#8217;m not a vegetarian.</p>

				<p>Yes!  I can&#8217;t agree more.  I love onion soup and wrote about it a few weeks ago &#8211; in fact, I didn&#8217;t have cheese or bread on hand at the time, so I used just onion, beef stock, and white wine.  I suppose that makes it mere onion soup, rather than French Onion Soup, but it&#8217;s still delicious, so people shouldn&#8217;t hold back because they lack the full list of ingredients.  Definitely the kind of meal that suggests more effort than was put in :)</p>

				<p>Perfect timing! I had already planned to make French onion soup today! I&#8217;ve had homemade beef stock simmering on the stove for the last three days and just a while ago strained it and put it in the fridge to harden the fat. I&#8217;ll be leaving out the flour and wine (I am on a strict candida diet). My kids will enjoy it with cheese and toasted French bread. Can&#8217;t wait!</p>

				<p>Since I&#8217;m a student, I have to stick to a budget. These are the recipes that can help me at the end of the month, after I spend too much money on fish, Buffalo mozzarella and other ingredients any other student wouldn&#8217;t buy. I&#8217;ve never made it at home, but ate it a couple of times in a bistro or café.<br />
Can I make it with red wine too? I&#8217;m more of a red wine drinker, and there&#8217;s almost always one bottle of red open.. I need something else besides spaghetti aglio e olio or chickpeas and tuna out of a can for my last week of the month, so I want try this!</p>

				<p>I started making this at home a few years ago because I realized that if I wanted to order it every time I see it on a menu I needed to know how to make it at home! The cognac, brown stock, and Gruyere are absolutely clutch in this dish. Yum&#8230; I think there&#8217;s nothing like being able to make these dishes for yourself at home.</p>

				<p>I think I made your 2006 recipe for this soup but didn&#8217;t comment.  Shame on me!  It was outstanding, of course, Julia or you never let me down.  I did add a large clove of garlic, just barely crushed, to it, because my husband just insisted.  I had made some beef stock from roasted beef ribs before I started the soup.  The stock was really good from such an inexpensive rack of bones, and I&#8217;m sure added greatly to the soups base.  The leftover soup I turned into a Sweet Sour Russian cabbage soup, so I got two different soups using this recipe as it&#8217;s base.  I love it when that happens!</p>

				<p>I can&#8217;t wait to try this, but I have 2 questions:</p>
<p>1. One of the eaters of this soup is a vegetarian, so I will need to use the alternative broths. How hard is it to find mushroom broth? I have never  heard of it.</p>
<p>2. I do not yet own crocks. Do you have a moderately priced brand you could recommend? I am not sure if it&#8217;s ok to ask you that. </p>
<p>Thanks. Everything I have made from your site has been divine.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve always been intimidated by onion soup &#8211; probably because it&#8217;s one of those classic dishes that seem simple but without the proper attention &#8211; can turn out kind of &#8220;blah.&#8221; Your recipe and photos have inspired me to try it! And thank you for the suggestion to use mushroom stock for a veggie substitution &#8211; I never thought of that before but I bet it adds a great richness to the dish!</p>

				<p>Hi! This recipe looks awesome and my husband LOVES french onion soup. I know this may be a bit blasphemous ;) but do you use store-bought stock? If so, do you have a favorite brand? I read some reviewers discuss home-made stock, but, honestly, we just don&#8217;t eat a lot of beef around here. (We usually have lots of poultry broth frozen from Thanksgiving!) Thanks!</p>

				<p>A great vegetarian substitution is veg broth with red miso mixed in.  The miso gives it a very deep beef-like flavor that just vegetables won&#8217;t give you.  I thought the results were fantastic.</p>

				<p>One of my absolute favorite dishes.  I love to order this in restaurants because they never taste the same.  I agree with all of your points&#8230;good carmelization, bread toasted just right, etc.  I have a lousy picture of my first attempt.  I was just getting into photography and I am ashamed to look at the photo but it sure did taste good.</p>

				<p>Regarding a white wine substitution: I have had good luck in risotto with substituting frozen apple juice concentrate.My husband- who is a chef- actually thought I had used wine (we don&#8217;t drink) and when I told him he was really thrilled/shocked.  I think the juice would act the same here so I&#8217;ll try it.</p>
<p>Mushroom stock: I think the company is called Pacific Foods? they have the mushroom stock in a box.</p>

				<p>For fully developing caramelized onions without the constant stirring, may I recommend indirect heat? Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Cut 3 tbsp butter into 1 tbsp hunks, put in bottom of largish dutch oven. Sprinkle 6 sliced onions over the butter, making sure the half-rounds separate from each other. You can do this by &#8220;crumbling&#8221; the sliced onions in your fist, as if you were crunching saltines into chowder. Midway through adding the onions, sprinkle them with some kosher salt. Lid the vessel and put in oven for 1 hour. Remove vessel from oven, unlid and stir. The onions should be medium brown by now, sort of khaki colored. Put vessel back in oven without any lid, cook for 30-45 minutes. When this step is completed, the onions should be dark brown. Put on stove top on medium-high heat. When it starts sticking deglaze with champagne, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, or Gewürztraminer. Continue making soup with mixed broths or as desired.</p>

				<p>I love, love, love French Onion Soup.  But I would not call it a cheap food to create.  The onions are cheap, yes.  But add up the costs of beef broth, Gruyère, vermouth, and a loaf of hearty bread?  It&#8217;s more like $20, not $5.</p>
<p>And when it comes to French cooking, it is the quality of the ingredients that make the difference. Sure, people could substitute, but the quality of this dish goes down substantially when that happens.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d wholeheartedly agree with everything about this post, except that it is an economical dish to make.</p>

				<p>- After I got a food processor I started making French onion soup more often because slicing the onions is no longer a weepy task.<br />
- Cognac or brandy is the secret ingredient.<br />
- We skip the cheese and it&#8217;s lovely with toast on the side for dipping.<br />
- Mushroom stock made from stems and dried mushrooms is an inexpensive substitute for Pacific broth. Costco sells a cost-effective half-gallon jar of dried mushrooms.<br />
- Set aside a few of those caramelized onions to mix with sour cream or drained yogurt for real onion dip.</p>

				<p>I actually made this on tuesday following the other recipe you posted on this (looks mighty similar btw). We love it! I had to substitute the white vermouth with red vermouth cause was out and I use sherry rather than cognac at the end but other than that&#8230;<br />
For those that haven&#8217;t tried it&#8230; try it, it&#8217;s a life altering experience!! ;-)</p>

				<p>There is definitely a universal thought pattern going on.  I have made onion soup twice in the last month.  WONDERFUL!  For the ultimate version, cognac, the bread, the cheese and homemade beef stock are a must but it is still wondeful meal made with chicken stockand served plain.  Enjoy.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to make French Onion soup, suspecting that it would far surpass any I&#8217;ve had at a restaurant. And I&#8217;ve been wanting to go through MTAOFC and actually cook from it instead of being the proud owner of it. Thank you for giving me the motivation in picture form that I needed to make it happen.</p>

				<p>Bea &#8212; I used store-bought this time. I like the Pacific brand; I usually grab the organic and free-range, mostly because they offer it.</p>
<p>Nicole &#8212; You can make your own, too. I&#8217;ve used a recipe before that suggested 9 cups of water to 1/2 pound any mushroom (white are fine) + 1 ounce rehydrated dried mushroom such as shiitake or porcini. You can throw in a diced onion, garlic, carrot etc. whatever you like in stock. Boil for an hour uncovered and strain.  I don&#8217;t own crocks either. I just used 2-cup bowls that are more rounded, i.e. nearly equally deep and wide. In my dish set, they were called &#8220;rice bowls&#8221;. </p>
<p>The price of soup! &#8212; I knew someone was going to ask, and the truth is, this is more of a $10 soup, but that&#8217;s because I forgot to include the price of stock. Which is more or less free if you&#8217;ve saved beef bones and can make your own. You save your beef bones, right?! I made short ribs this week and I did! Here was my budget on the main items:</p>
<p>Balthazar Baguette, used half: $1.25<br />
Onions, organic, half a 3-pound bag: $1.50<br />
4 ounces of a $10.99 surprisingly decent bottle of white wine: $1.73<br />
I used cave-aged Gruyere because I had it around, but you can get decent domestic Swiss for as little as $2.25 for 6 ounces<br />
4 tablespoons Trader Joe&#8217;s butter: $.50<br />
Total: $7.25</p>
<p>The math isn&#8217;t perfect, but there&#8217;s little question that you can feed 6 people hearty, amazing soup on a tight budget with this recipe.</p>
<p>Wine &#8212; As you can see above, I do not spend a lot of money on wine I cook with. My rule is that it has to be dry and passably drinkable (as in, I&#8217;d have a glass and not hate it, and I&#8217;m very picky) and beyond that, I could not care. I&#8217;ve never made this with red wine, but with the hearty beefy thing going on, I doubt it wouldn&#8217;t work. If you don&#8217;t drink wine, skip it. It&#8217;s simply a layer of flavor, but you&#8217;ll have a ton of flavor either way with this.</p>

				<p>Mmmm I love French Onion Soup.  My mom and I always make it at Christmastime. It is so warm and delicious when we&#8217;re up north in cold New Hampshire!  Plus it is super easy to make, even for a bunch of people.  Last year we tried cooking the onions down in the oven instead of on the stove and it worked great!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ll be making this for my family next rainy day!  I read somewhere (hopefully memory serves me right) that Onion Soup was Julia Child&#8217;s last meal.  That might seem like a downer but it strikes me as&#8230;comforting.  I hope my last meal is so lovely!</p>
<p>Deb, your website is such a delight to me.  You do a fantastic job.</p>

				<p>I do not have oven proof bowls/crocks and really would rather not have to store them. My question is do you think I could put parchment paper down on a cookie sheet and do the &#8220;topping&#8221; in pairs on the cookie sheet, put hot soup in bowls and then transfer the topping of croutons/cheese w/ a spatula to the waiting bowls of soup?</p>

				<p>Personally, I&#8217;m not fond of onions unless whirled well as a hidden flavor for soups, etc. but my boyfriend loves them, and I&#8217;ve been pondering making French Onion Soup for him for some time, so this is perfect! I&#8217;ve got a set of 4 mini soup toureens that would be perfect for part of it.  We&#8217;re also a dry household, so I&#8217;ll have to hold the wine and cognac.</p>

				<p>YAY!!!!<br />
I&#8217;m sooooooo excited to try my first French onion soup.<br />
It has been said that my Mom makes the best around (she makes her own beef stock)<br />
Now, it&#8217;s my turn. Turning the pungent onions into to sweet caramel. YEAH BABY!!!</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t eat beef. What&#8217;s a poor girl to do???<br />
What do you think about chicken stock and a big dash of Worcestershire???<br />
(Julia is rolling over in her grave, I&#8217;m sure of it!) </p>
<p>Bon Appétit!</p>

				<p>I rarely use beef stock but I wouldn&#8217;t dare sub anything else here. (Sorry but mushroom-based onion soup was just not the same during my vegetarian years.)</p>
<p>On the rare occasion we have any beef with bones in the house, I roast them, then simmer them for hours with a little vinegar (to pull out the gelatin) and the usual aromatics. Then I freeze it to have on hand for just this very purpose. The only downside is that we rarely want to eat onion soup out anymore. We can make it better at home.  :)</p>

				<p>Deb-</p>
<p>The soup looks beautiful and delicious. I can practically smell it from the photographs. (Someday I hope you&#8217;ll share your secretes to keeping such a pristine stovetop.)</p>
<p>I think the problem is with the sentence &#8220;Have $5 to spend on dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>The cost of the meal, as broken down by you, requires an outlay of more than $5. For starters, it requires the purchase of a $10.99 bottle of wine.</p>
<p>I realize you&#8217;re amortizing the cost of the wine, but for some of us wine is simply not in the budget. (And neither is cognac or Gruyere, as much as we may like them.) As for saving beef bones to make a homemade stock, some of us can&#8217;t afford to buy short ribs these days. We have no bones to save. </p>
<p>Like you, Thomas Keller also feeds six with his onion soup recipe, but he calls for *8 lbs of onions* (for readers without a kitchen scale, that&#8217;s 8 large onions) and a whole baguette. (Interestingly, he also insists on only using aged cheese due to its crusting abilities, and prefers Comte to Gruyere.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that you *can* feed six people on three small onions, some broth, half a baguette and a few ounces of cheese. But unless they&#8217;re supermodels, you&#8217;d probably have to also feed them something else in order to call it a meal.</p>
<p>None of this detracts from your mouthwatering recipe or your equally mouthwatering prose. </p>
<p>The fact is caramelized onions are magic. Even when combined with only water and a judicious amount of kosher salt, they can make a tasty soup. </p>
<p>I hope readers who are economically challenged will see this recipe for what it is:  a gorgeous, inspirational jumping-off point. Use a bouillon cube, chicken stock if that&#8217;s all you&#8217;ve got. (Keep the kitchen curtains drawn and the gourmet police will never find out.) Heck, try miso. Don&#8217;t have wine? How about a splash of something acidic. Mirin, citrus, balsamic vinegar. No, it won&#8217;t be the same. And it certainly won&#8217;t be traditional French onion soup but it just may be tasty and it will warm your belly.</p>

				<p>I definitely enjoy onion soup but I wouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;I’m firmly of the belief that no matter what ails you in the realm of the kitchen, onion soup can cure it.&#8221;<br />
It seems just a little farfetched.<br />
I know that onions contain vitamin B, vitamin C and small amounts of minerals.<br />
But what about the other contents of the soup? Doesn&#8217;t alcohol lower your immune system not heal it?<br />
Also buying cognac or brandy (which is usually $5-$7 of a 60ml bottle) and white wine (usually priced around 750ml $4-$6) will usually set you back more the five dollars if I&#8217;m not mistaken.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong I like the recipe and would like to try it I’m just wondering if the opening statement is a bit too optimistic.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m in Asia and would love to make this soup. However, I don&#8217;t often have open bottles of white wine lying around &#8211; do you think it would be possible to use mirin (sweet Japanese rice wine for cooking) instead? I&#8217;ve seen sites that recommend using a dry sherry if you don&#8217;t have mirin and was wondering if the reverse would work as well.  Thanks so much for the really helpful site. It&#8217;s a great inspiration to me that you&#8217;re also cooking in a small kitchen &#8211; I live in a city where the property prices are more expensive than NYC and only have a 6&#215;8ft kitchen (including countertop, fridge &amp; stovetop space)! :)</p>

				<p>I feel a little embarrassed to admit this but&#8230; I&#8217;ve never cooked a Julia Child recipe. I even, ok, here goes&#8230; I even thought that maybe the hype around Julia, particularly since the movie, might have been, well, a little misplaced? But I&#8217;m SO glad you&#8217;ve delivered me out of my ignorance with this onion soup recipe. I&#8217;ve read plenty of onion soup recipes that are left in the dust by this one. I won&#8217;t hesitate before buying her tome now. Thank you! Angela</p>

				<p>My lovely Dad, who died a year and a half ago, used to make this for us, using Julia&#8217;s recipe &#8211; his copy of the book falls open at the page and is heavily stained from decades of use. When I make it, I can hear him telling me how important it is to caramelise the onions thoroughly and properly. My all time favourite &#8211; with such lovely memories of the entire family round the table. Thanks Deb.</p>

				<p>Deb. I love onion soup and have been making it for years. If you are ever up for trying my version it is delicious. Ir is topped with a cheese souffle then baked. U think the steam Deimos the soup keeps the souffle from<br />
Falling. I first had this at the CIA in Napa area.<br />
rosemaryandthegoat.com/2009/06/06/5/. souffled onion soup. I hope you will try it. So rich. I had a few bread cubes in bottom and definitely leave off the cheese before adding te souffle</p>

				<p>Thanks for the recipe!  I have a much-beloved recipe of my own for onion soup, but I&#8217;ll give yours a try and see how they stack up &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I like yours better.  :)  The only change I&#8217;ll make is that I like to cut the bread into cubes &#8211; it just makes it easier to eat.  I pile a bunch of cubes in the soup and cover with cheese like normal.  Delicious!</p>

				<p>Lovely interpretation of a classy classic recipe. I bought ten pounds of onions the other day and there is always cheese in the fridge, seems like a great meal for this evening. But &#8211; $5, really? Not how I describe this recipe. You can make a onion soup for $5, but not this one.</p>

				<p>Maria &#8212; No reason not to try it, but maybe just use half in case the sweetness is very noticeable.</p>
<p>Bowls &#8212; We registered for a set of dishes from Calvin Klein khaki when we got married. I went back to pick up a few more pieces this year &#8212; and a few other odd end colors &#8212; and they seem to be phasing them out as even CK.com itself couldn&#8217;t fully fulfill my order. The bowl shown is the &#8220;rice&#8221; bowl and it&#8217;s in a brown/maroon color called &#8220;raisin&#8221;.</p>

				<p>I can smell it now.  I first made Julia&#8217;s recipe in 1964 when I was a new bride.  Everyone loves it.  Here&#8217;s a suggestion.  Although this sounds self-evident &#8212; toast your bread in the oven.  (I talked to someone who told me it took her forever to toast the bread in the toaster and it never dried out enough.  Duh.)    Approximately 400 degrees F for about 20 minutes.  Check after 10 minutes and turn over.  Another suggestion:  Cut the bread into large cubes then toast in the oven.  Makes it easier to eat.  I&#8217;ve always used Gruyere, maybe I&#8217;m in a rut.  And please &#8212; always add the cognac.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been making a French Onion soup recipe I think that&#8217;s just the best from a restaurant that was inside a major department store for many years where I grew up. The store is long gone, the restaurant too but luckily I got my hands on the recipe. It is very similar to Julia&#8217;s except for that addition of cognac (maybe that&#8217;s the real French part).</p>
<p>But one thing I have done to simplify it a bit for me is to cook the onions overnight in my crockpot. I add the ingredients typical for that long slow cooking, the butter, salt, sugar and a bit of wine&#8230;and then forget about them. I&#8217;ll cook double what is necessary for the soup and love having caramelized onions in the fridge for omelets, sandwiches, fajitas and more. Call me a caramelized onion addict. I can handle it.</p>

				<p>Love onion soup! I agree with one of your other followers that it isnt a cheap meal to make. With something as simple as an onion soup it is all dependent on the quality of ingredients. I think everyone has their own version of it. I like a little brandy and a little thyme. I&#8217;ll certainly be making it this week.</p>

				<p>I think I used too little onion, but so far it&#8217;s simmering and it&#8217;s alright. :)</p>
<p>I halved the recipe and chopped only one onion; I didn&#8217;t make a proper stock, going for more of a broth&#8230; but I hope it turns alright. Apparently we have 15 year old Hennessy in the cabinet, so maybe that&#8217;ll up the flavour ;)</p>

				<p>I love onion soup, but I make a variation I had in a restaurant in Vermont a couple of years ago- it used sweet onions, chicken stock, fresh thyme, and a small splash of apple cider. It is a much lighter tasting soup, but a great alternative to the original.</p>

				<p>Nothing better than onion soup!  I&#8217;ve taken the &#8216;carmelizing of the onions&#8217; trick from Cooks Illustrated. Much easier and a deep, rich flavor. You carmelize them in the oven over a number of hours, same effect, half the stirring/watching. Delish! Bon appetit!<br />

				<p>Your flickr upload caught my eye even before the post appeared, and I thought ahead to this rainy weekend &#8211; it was the perfect use for the beef stock I had been hoarding in the freezer. With homemade beef stock and the cognac and the slow caramelization, it was the best onion soup I&#8217;ve ever had. Thanks for putting the recipe in my path! I also used a bit of truffle oil on the croutons&#8230; a bit over the top but hey, I had guests :)  So crazy good.</p>

				<p>Deb, I made this recipe late this afternoon and it was indeed perfect.  I used Parmesan and Gruyere, white wine, but no cognac (didn&#8217;t have any, I know).  The caramelized onions become almost sweet in the soup, which was so good with the cheese, we loved it.  In a week or two I will post my results on my sight, giving you full credit for the recipe and following your FAQ answer.  Thanks for a delicious dinner.</p>

				<p>Our teenager is living back home for 4 months on a co-op work term with university.  The deal is that he needs to cook the Sunday dinner.  Tonight included French Onion Soup.  I took a picture, which I am sure he has posted on his Facebook page, knowing that such a talent makes him a bit of a chick magnet.  I loved and tasted great!</p>

<p>Someone mentioned doing the onion caramelization in the oven.  I have tried that successfully.  But I am a fiddler.  I like to stir and look and smell so have resorted to going back to the stove top.  Also think it might be more energy conscious but what do I really know about that.</p>
<p>Our teenager has been reading Smitten Kitchen for about 3 years now.  Longer than I have been a food blogger.  I blame him for my food porn addiction.</p>

				<p>How does the cognac or brandy contribute to the flavour of the soup? Do you think it&#8217;s something that should definitely be included? Which do you prefer, cognac or brandy?</p>

				<p>So Going to make this! I might be the only one in my house who will eat it, but so what?! Though the last time I made onion soup was about 15 years ago, and my mother and I ate so much of it you didn&#8217;t want to light a match in the house! (Any ideas for fixing that effect?)</p>
<p>For the fellow vegetarians, a little miso definitely deepened the umami flavor of the soup way back when. I&#8217;ve gotten very into mushroom broth, using stems and a bit of dried to make stock when I sautee wild mushrooms and then using it for quinoa. This looks like a beautiful follow up to allow for gourmet night after gourmet night!</p>
<p>Thanks, Deb.</p>

				<p>This recipe spoke to me this afternoon when I was trying to figure out dinner.  The onions took a bit longer for me, but I think it was more a fear of overheating (and burning) than anything inherently wrong with the recipe. Lesson learned.  Thank you for the dinner inspiration and the excuse to buy a bottle of wine for Sunday evening.</p>

				<p>Hi, Deb!<br />
- I very, VERY much apreciate your recipes, since a long time ago I use them as the go to place;<br />
-I live somewhere in Europe, where usually recipes are in grams, except for small quantities, i.e. salt, which we generally use by teaspoon;<br />
-I very humbly (and I mean humbly) dare to suggest that, when transforming quantities in grams, to round them at 25 grams. For example, I would never, for the love of everything, use 680 grams of onions, but 700. And I think you wouldn&#8217;t mind an extra fraction of an ounce when you have a pound and a half. Even for the butter, where the tranformation in metric calls for 42 grams, I would round it at 50 (also, knowing that butter packages come in 200 or 250 grams, it&#8217;s so easy to divide);<br />
-would you be so kind to appreciate how much is a tablespoon of butter? Ounces are alrght. I take it for being 25 grams of butter for a tblsp. About one ounce;<br />
-I&#8217;m sorry to sound like miss Prissy, it&#8217;s just me&#8230;<br />
Big kiss on J&#8217;s cheeks! (oh, the fresh, firm cheeks of a baby!)</p>

				<p>I guess it should be &#8220;gratinéed&#8221;  &#8211; Alt130 should work for the accent.<br />
I freaking love onion soup. I&#8217;ve used gourmet&#8217;s recipe with thyme forever, which is absolutely delicious &#8211; but this looks perfect without to.<br />
As for the discussion on budget vs. non budget &#8211; I think this is budget for someone who cooks. I almost always have an open bottle of wine around, and a bag of onions is almost without exception in my kitchen. I think anything that is mostly staples is budget, because these are things you are buying anyway. Beautiful, Deb!! (I mean, gruyere is awesome, but can I confess to using the mozza ball?? Er, not very french, but yeah. Stilll good.)</p>

				<p>Julia&#8217;s other soups in Mastering are pretty dynamite as well &#8212; I make the leek and potato soup all the time, and recently made her cream of mushroom soup for the first time which was just lovely.  Now keeping my eyes open for sorrel to try her sorrel soup.</p>

				<p>I grew up in Montreal, where Onion soup is soul food. Over the years the best methodology I have used is the one Cook&#8217;s Illustrated developed, where you caramelise the onions in the oven first and then finish on the stove top creating very deep, dark luscious frond. Also their version uses both beef and chicken stock which also gives a nice depth of flavour.</p>

				<p>mariah &#8212; Totally fine. Most Dutch ovens are indeed cast iron, but then coated with enamel, inside and out, so there&#8217;s no direct seasoning to mess up. Or at least that&#8217;s what I understand from my Staubs.</p>
<p>diana &#8212; One tablespoon of butter is half an ounce or 14 grams. I hear you about the rounding, but I like the precision of being specific, assuming most folks use digital scales. If I told you that 14 grams was instead 10 for rounding, by the time you had 3 tablespoons of butter, you could be off by a full tablespoon, which would definitely mess up a baking recipe. But, there&#8217;s no reason that you cannot round the numbers I present, knowing that they haven&#8217;t already been.</p>
<p>Elizabeth &#8212; I used a knife. But I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024JZX8O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0024JZX8O" rel="nofollow">these</a> shortly thereafter. My eyes are really sensitive. I&#8217;ve tried every onion-cutting trick in the book, but none save me from pounds of yellow onions in a tiny kitchen!</p>
<p>Sweet onions &#8212; Personally, I prefer the yellow ones. Because they start with such an agressive bite, once caramelized and sweetened, they have a more dynamic flavor than an onion that started mild and only got sweeter. That&#8217;s my rationale, at least. Meanwhile, I just saw a recipe for a sweeter onion soup with some other stuff in it and may not be able to resist making it, as it seems to take the extra sweetness in mind. I&#8217;ll share it here, if it is indeed amazing. </p>
<p>Accent correction &#8212; Thank you!</p>
<p>Samantha &#8212; First, I need to say that I forget to add the Cognac or brandy about 75% of the time. It is <i>wonderful</i> in there but the soup is also wonderful without it. It&#8217;s just an extra layer of flavor. If you don&#8217;t want to shell out a lot, get brandy. If you think you&#8217;ll appreciate having it around, get Cognac.</p>

				<p>This might be heresy, but I make my onion soup in a crockpot.  Yes, I&#8217;m that lazy.  Basically, fill the crock with sliced onions, add 4 T butter, and cook on low for 8-10 hours.  The onions get beautifully caramelized and the house smells amazing.  Then in with the beef stock until it&#8217;s hot; good quality stock is absolutely mandatory here.  Separately, oven-toast slices of baguette with grated cheese on top.  Put a toast round in the bottom of a soup bowl, ladle over some soup, and enjoy!</p>

				<p>Man, I don&#8217;t know why but onion soup seems to give people MEGA nasty gas. Also: Never use garden onions for this purpose. They are way too strong. I was sweating the smell of onions for like two days, like in that book &#8220;the whipping boy.&#8221;</p>

				<p>I adore onion soup.  But we have a huge debate going on in our house about this soup.  Well, not the soup itself, but the treatment of bread and cheese.  I love the traditional method of plopping in the bread and broiling the cheese over top.  My husband says this creates a soggy gross mess of bread in the soup.  And he has a point.  He likes simple croutons and a spinkle of cheese.  Either way, onion soup is lovely!</p>

				<p>My boyfriend makes endless fun of me for it, but I keep a pair of swimming goggles in my kitchen drawer, just for onions. I may look ridiculous, but in the privacy of my kitchen I don&#8217;t care!

				<p>Julia all the way.</p>
<p>I bought her &#8220;The Way to Cook&#8221; in 1989, and the onion soup version therein is my basic. I usually double it, as it freezes quite well, and it doesn&#8217;t take much longer to slice 5 lbs. of onions thinly.</p>
<p>Now I want to make some. It&#8217;s been too long!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been making a similar version for years now.  The onions MUST be cooked for a long time (sometimes up to an hour) to truly caramelize, as you have in above recipe.  I use vermouth and add a few sprigs of fresh thyme that I fish out before serving.  The thyme adds another layer of complexity.  Now I&#8217;m craving onion soup!</p>

				<p>For vegetarians &#8212; you can make any kind of soup or gravy that would normally have a brown-stock base with vegetable stock!  And it will taste right!  Just add a good spoonful (or more &#8212; it depends on how much stock you are using, so you need to taste this to check the amounts) of Marmite when you add the stock (and yes, Marmite is fairly vile by itself, but it does amazing things to vegetarian soups &amp; gravies).  It works, I swear.</p>

				<p>Lately I have been dreaming of whipping up some homemade french onion soup, and now I feel I must follow through!<br />
When I was younger I went through a very strong onion soup phase right after I had my first taste- no matter where I was, if it was on the menu, my meal was build around that as my starter!</p>
<p>I will be saving this recipe for a rainy/dreary day in when the comfort and ooey-gooeyness is most needed.</p>

				<p>All excellent advice.  Here&#8217;s my tip &#8211; go big!  tuck away numerous containers in the freezer for when you don&#8217;t feel like cooking and want something good and homey.  But that is my general approach to cooking. mmmm&#8230;&#8230;..</p>

				<p>I can&#8217;t wait to make this! I made a French onion soup once with leftover stock from a Suzanne Goin braised short rib recipe (this one: <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/12/braised-beef-short-ribs/)" rel="nofollow">http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/12/braised-beef-short-ribs/)</a> and although it was not traditional, it was incredibly delicious, to the point where I&#8217;m thinking of sneaking some sacrilegious port into my next batch of onion soup!</p>

				<p>I just made the Bouchon version of onion soup this week. EIGHT pounds of onions cooked down to less than 2 cups, which took about 7 1/2 hours (the recipe said 6 hours). He recommends making the soup base the day before to let the flavors meld. </p>
<p>I have to say, it was the best onion soup I&#8217;ve ever had, and I&#8217;ve made the Julia version. Not sure that it&#8217;s worth the time for everyone, but Google it if you&#8217;re interested and don&#8217;t have the book (at $50, who could blame you?)</p>
<p>One worthwhile tip for any version of the soup is to cut the onions pole to pole (with the grain), which really helps keep the onions from falling apart.</p>

				<p>oh yumm!  I bought little french onion soup bowls last year but got afraid to make it after seeing someone on the Food Network say that it&#8217;s a difficult thing to make and succeed, but after seeing your recipe, I want to try it!  It&#8217;s supposed to rain this weekend and I think that will be the perfect time to have some good warm comfort food like French Onion Soup!  I can&#8217;t wait!</p>

				<p>Have you tried the Cook&#8217;s Illustrated method of starting the onions in the oven and then caramelizing and deglazing in increments? If so, I&#8217;d like to know why you settled on this method instead. I tried their way this winter when I made this for the first time (partly to use up the rest of the Gruyere I had from your amazing cauliflower gratin), but still found it pretty time-consuming. While it was certainly full-flavored and had quite a rich aroma, I actually ended up being sick of the smell of onions and threw about 1/4 of the pot away I believe, as it took the two of us about a week to get through the pot. I highly reccomend Julia&#8217;s technique for the gratinee, especially the cheese stirred into the soup (I don&#8217;t think I bothered with the grated onion, but might next time, especially if serving more than 2). To us, it really needed the combination of Gruyere AND Parmesan, but perhaps it all depends on your cheese. Ours greatly benefited from the extra saltiness/umami of the Parmesan, plus I didn&#8217;t quite have enough Gruyere to get a very cheesy top, and I think the Parmesan we buy is a bit cheaper than Gruyere, for the budget-minded. (It&#8217;s also something we always keep around, which I wish was also the case for the Cognac, as I imagine it elevates this to heavenly, but I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to purchase it.) Sigh&#8230;I want to make this again now, but the long cooking time means I have another 2 seasons to wait, as our tiny little apartment here in Iowa is already having a hard time keeping cool, making me wish to be back in moderate Germany, where good Gruyere was easy to come by and Spaetzle was always on the menu.</p>

				<p>I made this last night for a late dinner with my husband. Hit the spot and helped him to forget the pain of continuously being beat by me at You Don&#8217;t Know Jack. The caramelization took longer for me (about an hour) because I used more onions and the inside of my Dutch Oven is white enamel. I ended up raising the flame to a solid medium to get things going. Also, breaking out the Courvoisier always brings out the giggles as my husband does a mean Leon Phelps (Tim Meadows&#8217; Ladies Man). So thank you for the laughs and the great food and breakfast for the thirteen year old. You are magnifique, dude!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of Julia&#8217;s French Onion Soup.  I especially like the gratineed version from her fantastic book, The Way to Cook, of which I&#8217;m fortunate to have an autographed copy.  I&#8217;ve made it in the large casserole, and brought to the table immediately it makes quite a presentation!  The taste is divine, as I&#8217;m sure this version is as well.  You can&#8217;t go wrong with Julia!  I really enjoy your blog!</p>

				<p>The soup looks yummy! For those wondering about the onion goggles &#8211; I&#8217;ve had a pair for years, and they work for me. My eyes are very sensitive and the goggles are a lifesaver; even shallots bother me. I used to have to dash away from the cutting board every few chops, but now I can make it through my chopping duties in relative comfort (and despite any mocking &#8211; they do look kinda silly).</p>

				<p>Oh man&#8230;In my twenties, I used to make F.O.S. for my hubbie (then boyfriend) about once a week.  I made it for the first time in years about two months ago.  We felt so nostalgic.  I told my kids that their dad and I ate it so much because we were poor and onions are cheap.  (I didn&#8217;t share with them the $15.00 I spent on cheese.  The whole point of making it is getting to nibble on cheese and wine while the onions cook, right?)  Does anyone else throw a bay leaf or a little thyme in?</p>

				<p>YUMMY!!!!!!!  I agree with Eric on the Bouchon version being amazing (and really, really labor-intensive! So many onions!) and have only ever made the soup with a few drops of sherry vinegar at the end like TK suggests&#8230; now I&#8217;m really really wanting to try it with cognac instead!  Any suggestions on buying cognac since I&#8217;m completely unfamiliar with it? Thank you!!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m so, so, so poor right now (rent, man, you know?), so this was great.  But it takes years and years to prepare.  I wish there was a way to make great french onion soup in 20 minutes, but alas.</p>

				<p>The fabulous aroma of caramelizing onion&#8230;.I can imagine the first sip. I love onion soup! Now I&#8217;m wondering why I never make it? My favorite bowl, a lovely spoon&#8230;.OK, onions on the shopping list for this weekend.</p>

				<p>I made this last night after ending a two year-long streak of vegetarianism. It was absolutely fantastic. My boyfriend said it was the best soup he had ever had, and I have to say that it is probably the best french onion soup I&#8217;ve ever had as well. I would not attempt to add bay leaves, rosemary, or any other seasonings. It&#8217;s awesome as is. Sidenote: Caramelizing the onions took a bit longer for me, so the soup as a whole ended up taking 2 hours. This may have been since I used a pot that wasn&#8217;t very heavy on the bottom so I was afraid of burning the onions to the bottom and may have reduced the heat more than necessary.</p>
<p>My modifications: I used half beef broth and half vegetable broth since I&#8217;m still easing into using &#8220;meat products&#8221; and don&#8217;t like when things taste too meaty; I also don&#8217;t like using all of a single type of broth because I think it tastes less interesting and too much like I&#8217;m just drinking broth by itself. I also didn&#8217;t gratinee mine because I&#8217;m lazy, but I really enjoy buying a baguette, slicing it up, and crumbling/grating various cheeses on top (usually Parmesan and Gruyere; some goats cheese if I have it) and then baking the little baguette slices for 10-15 minutes so they get toasty and the cheese melts. I then put a few of the baguette slices in the soup, top the soup with more cheese, and let it all sit for a few minutes to melt the cheese, let the bread soak up the broth, and let the soup cool off. I find that this is very easy and is almost just like actually gratinee-ing the soup, as the bread breaks down quickly and is easy to eat out of the bowl even if it&#8217;s not originally in bite-sized pieces.</p>

				<p>Audrey &#8212; Yes, that&#8217;s exactly why!</p>
<p>Bobanda &#8212; It&#8217;s only too salty if you add too much salt. Restaurants almost always do, I usually cannot eat them. At home, perfect seasoning is yours for the taking!</p>

				<p>To some this soup up in one work it would have to be beautiful. All the aromas and tastes combine to produce a great flavour on the pallet. The onion is not too overpowering and it makes a wonderful lunch with some fresh french stick bread. Many people haven&#8217;t heard or tryed onion soup but if you like onion then I would recomend this recipe to everyone.</p>

				<p>I convinced my mother to make this for dinner last night &#8211; and I was super disappointed.  This is the first time I haven&#8217;t LOVED one of these recipes.  The soup was made with half the suggested amount of sugar, and it still tasted really really sweet. Oh well, on to the next recipe.</p>

				<p>This onion soup is a truly amazing recipe, I served it at a family dinner and has been a delight. I usually am not that adventurous with new food recipes but this is better than any restaurant can make it. I used chicken instead of the beef and it was nevertheless excellent. Great recipe, already recommended the blog to my friends.</p>

				<p>Hmm Sounds delicious and simple to make. I already have most of the ingredients to go. Just need to add some cognac to my shopping list at the weekend and will definately be testing this out on my friends at a nice dinner party. Sounds like a perfect comfort food for winter nights too. There&#8217;s nothing quite like a nice homemade soup on those dark winter nights when you fall in from work and want something quick, tasty and nourishing to warm the bones and the heart.</p>

				<p>Just made this. I used the mushroom stock and it was good, but def. needs more salt than I would imagine beef broth would. also, i have to agree with some previous comments regarding the cost. Gruyere is expensive!! It cost $12 to have enough. Because of that we decided not to splurge and buy cognac or brandy and so left it out. We didn&#8217;t have it lying around, sadly.</p>
<p>I also have a question: when I went to purchase crocks, the standard size for F.O. soup types (according to 2 different cooking stores) is 16oz. I made this recipe to exact measurement and it BARELY had enough for 4 half filled bowls. Is there another size you used to serve 6? </p>
<p>Oh, and one tiny little thing &#8211; the recipe did not say to cover the pot in the first 15 minute steep session. The next paragraph said, &#8216;uncover&#8217; but dang if I didn&#8217;t notice that in my first read. So I didn&#8217;t cover and that set me back because the onions didn&#8217;t soften the way they should have. NO big deal and reminds me to read through the recipe more carefully.</p>
<p>Thanks for the delicious and creative recipes! I love trying all of these dishes.</p>

				<p>Hello</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to report that I made this for last night&#8217;s dinner and it was divine. I made it Tuesday night after the kids went to bed for Wed night dinner. </p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t have cognac or brandy around (we usually do) so I let that go. I didn&#8217;t have beef stock and the local co-op was out so I got this &#8220;better than boullion&#8221;&#8230;a short/squat jar w/ a paste inside that you add to hot water. I&#8217;ve never seen this before but it worked.</p>
<p>And&#8230;drumroll&#8230;.my 3yo gave it a huge thumbs up and ae a big bowl. My  6yo was not in favor but three out of four is pretty good around here!</p>

				<p>Kelly &#8212; Glad it was a hit. I&#8217;m a huge fan of Better Than Bouillon and always keep the beef, chicken and vegetable in the fridge if I&#8217;m in a pinch, or you know, want to improve rice. My only gripe is that they&#8217;re crazy salty, so you often don&#8217;t need any other added salt.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t wait to try this! Is the flour essential in this recipe? Also I have some Pacific low sodium beef broth in the pantry.  Do you think this would do, or do you have something else you would recommend?</p>

				<p>LC &#8212; I used Pacific this time. The flour adds some body/thickness to the soup but if you don&#8217;t eat flour, I&#8217;m sure it will still be delicious. Maybe add an extra onion for bulk.</p>

				<p>Very interesting. I love how your recipe is very similar to how I have always done mine minus the sugar and the grated raw onion. I can see how two two steps would make a difference. Why is it that both French Onion Soup and Beef Bourguignon are such staples or colder days?</p>

				<p>Okay, so I made this recipe last night. And it&#8217;s good. Very good&#8230; but definitely not the best I&#8217;ve made. I should probably explain that my standards for excellent FO soup are absurdly high &#8211; it&#8217;s basically the first recipe I decided to learn to master when I realized it was time to learn to COOK, and not just prepare convenience/packaged things. And now, about 12 years later, FO soup is still one f my very favorite things to make. So I came to this recipe hopeful, though with very high requirements. My two favorite FO recipes are the Williams Sonoma one from their 2001 (I think, though perhaps it&#8217;s really from 2000) cookbook &#8220;Soup&#8221;, and the Cooks Illustrated/America&#8217;s Test Kitchen one which uses the oven to do 2/3 of the caramelization (this is the same one that your commented from post 220 was referring to). The WS recipe uses more butter, twice the onions, and cooks entirely on the stove. It takes about 3 hours for the caramelization to complete and for the flavors to meld, and is so, so incredibly deep and heady in flavor it is like a taste bud revelation. There are no shortcuts &#8211; nothing like flour or sugar to help the caramelizing process along, just lots, and lots of gentle heat and a hell of a lot of stirring to prevent burning or sticking. It is my gold standard for rich flavor. The CI recipe gains richness, instead from it&#8217;s oven cook method and the multiple deglazings of the fond that forms. That one also uses the addition of thyme to add another layer of flavor that definitely enhances the overall experience, and has great mouthfeel. The CI is my most commonly made FO recipe at this pint for convenience&#8217;s sake. It still needs a good hour of prep/stove time, but with a 4 year old running around I take what time I can grab. I&#8217;m sure you know what I mean. ;) So now onto this recipe. First, it had great onion flavor, but not high enough. I think the recipe should be a bit more specific than to cook until an &#8220;even, deep golden brown,&#8221; which is actually rather subjective. I did this and cook for probably 50 minutes post-sweating stage, and most people would say it was fine&#8230; but if it had called to cook until it was the color of a grocery store paper bag it would have been so, so much richer in flavor and more easy for people to understand, I think, and would have negated the need to add sugar at all.  Also, I didn&#8217;t care for flour as a thickener &#8211; heck, I don&#8217;t care for any sort of thickener for onion soup. I did add the cognac, as I happened to have an open bottle of Hennessey in the cabinet, but I think it actually made the soup flatter than it would have been had it been left out and the onions just left to brown further. I missed the flavor of thyme and bay leaf that I&#8217;ve come to realize adds brightness and complexity, too. Also, the grted raw onion in the gratinee was completely and utterly lost. I couldn&#8217;t taste even the smallest bite. And the french bread was fine, but when I was in France I picked up the habit of tearing the bread into rough pieces before toasting, which gives even more of a rustic flair to it and adds more crevices and crannies for the cheese to melt into. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; it was a nice soup recipe, and about 100 times better than most people who open a box of onion soup mix and add water an call it a day. But it won&#8217;t replace my other two favorites, sorry. Hope this was helpful, and if you&#8217;re interested in either of the other two recipes I referred to, just shoot me and email. I&#8217;d be happy to pass them on to you. :)</p>

				<p>Uhm, I still have this in the last stages of simmering on the stove, and I think I have used my &#8220;tasting spoon&#8221; (read: large soup spoon) enough that I have probably eaten about an entire bowl-size serving *while* it&#8217;s been cooking.  No cognac or brandy in the house, but may try adding a little bourbon at the end&#8230;  Mmmm.</p>

				<p>Update: bourbon works!  Used 3 tbsp and husband thinks it&#8217;s perfect&#8230; I&#8217;ll probably use 2 1/2 tbsp next time, but it really is pretty damned delicious.  Lighter than I&#8217;d expected it to be, with an unbelievable amount of wonderful complex flavor.  Wow.  I&#8217;m hooked.  And I loooooove that it doesn&#8217;t require a lot of ingredients.  This one is gonna be a staple around here.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>this is the second time only I&#8217;ve made FOS and this recipe has really raised the bar. Think i will try adding some thyme next time as others have suggested but it was extra great just as it was. Rainy night here in Sydney; perfect antidote!</p>

				<p>This was delicious! I actually skipped the raw onion and the oven baking &#8211; I just stuck the bowls directly under the broiler with toasted French bread and cheese to finish off and served.  I didn&#8217;t read the whole recipe before starting, so it was dinner time and my family was getting restless.  It was still very yummy!</p>

				<p>Please do not add sugar, it is totally unnecessary and people really add it to hide the shortcuts they take with ingredients and technique.  Also do not leave out dry wine or it will be too sweet (Although too sweet is not in the vocabulary of most Americans).  In a pinch dry rice wine will substitute.  I really prefer Greyere or Emmentaller.  The key to this soup is to caramelize the onions until they look like they might burn, they can get extremely dark.  This is what separates the men from the boys in onion soup making and does not cost a cent except perhaps in power bills.  I used to make this in college because I was poor.  This was after I left being a chef so I could have a life and went back to school.  I trained with French Chefs and never once saw so much as a pinch of sugar.</p>

				<p>Liz, have you read this blog for long? When Deb takes a shortcut, she does so because it&#8217;s a smart, pragmatic move. And &#8220;too sweet&#8221;? Have you made any of the cakes, cookies, scones, and other baked goods from this blog? Many Americans do indeed have a threshold for sweetness that is far lower than people from other cultures may think it is, and the sweet recipes here are shining examples of the fact that there IS such a thing as too much sugar. I haven&#8217;t yet made a baked good from this blog that was too sweet, and many others can say the same.</p>
<p>One of the good things about America is that we gladly take opportunities to do things our own way, and that includes making a classical dish as best suits one&#8217;s tastebuds. Why judge the way someone else makes a dish? It&#8217;s wasted energy. You do it your way, I&#8217;ll do it mine, and we can both be happy.</p>

				<p>Deb, Thank you for the absolutely incredible dinner last night! This soup was incredible made with my homemade veggie broth and I didn&#8217;t even have brandy to add. Topped with fresh baked Italian bread and finished with romano cheese toasty in the broiler. I skipped the toasting the bread step, and that was a mistake. I&#8217;ll definitely toast next time! Bread was a bit overly soggy. I&#8217;m going to put a link to your recipe on my blog to spread the deliciousness!</p>

				<p>I made this a few days ago, and it blew my mind! I thought the french onion I was getting at restaurants was good, but they have nothing on this recipe. I can&#8217;t imagine what it would taste like if I had the brandy on hand or homemade broth. I just used regular old beef boullion cubes. I also made mine too saltly, but it was still fantastic!</p>

				<p>I tried it but had no french bread so used a whole loaf 7 grain which added an element of nuttiness.  This was very good.  Its simple but takes time in the kitchen lest any newby take the few steps and be surprised.  It just needs nudging along.  Great to cook when you have a project you can do alongside.  </p>
<p>Now its sunny so may have to park this recipe until the fall.</p>

				<p>My uncle makes the most amazing onion soup for Christmas every year.  I can almost replicate his recipe when I need a mid-winter pick me up.  It&#8217;s almost always what I want when I have a cold.  I know he adds some worcestershire sauce and uses beef consumme as well as broth.  In a pinch a couple weeks ago I just used the consumme and added a can of water and then added a bit of low sodium soy sauce (a total accident since I thought I had grabbed the worcestershire, but it worked!).  I hate onions and I love onion soup!  I usually stick to a broth or throw in mushrooms to have a bit more substance to it.  I agree on the slow caramelization.  I also usually remove a couple spoonfuls and cook them on a higher heat and then add back to deepen the flavor a bit. Garlic is a must too.  Just a bit, about 1 med/sm clove per onion (for small batch).  For me it enhances the onions.   </p>
<p>He&#8217;s also made it with vegetable stock and we perceived no differences.  Still delish!</p>

				<p>Liz &#8212; Sugar isn&#8217;t a shortcut. It&#8217;s a suggestion by Julia Child to get the most out of your onions. There&#8217;s absolutely no reason you have to use if you believe it is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Mame &#8212; Make it until it says &#8220;Set aside until needed&#8221;. Maybe 40 minutes before you want to serve it, bring it back to a boil and continue from there.</p>

				<p>So embarrassing but this gave me VERY nasty gas, though it didn&#8217;t affect my husband (poor him!).  Does anyone know why this would be and what I can do to avoid it?  The soup was awesome but I couldn&#8217;t make it again given the reaction I had!!</p>

				<p>This was extremely good, and since I had an ancient piece of Gruyere in my fridge, an inch of wine at the bottom of a bottle, a deformed baguette I&#8217;d made the night before out of extra pizza dough, and a container of very rich chicken stock I&#8217;m made from Monday&#8217;s roast-chicken leftovers, I felt very frugal indeed&#8211;most of the above would have probably been tossed after some vague statute of limitations had expired or mold had formed.  The specified brown stock would have been better than my chicken stock, I&#8217;m sure, and I agree with the posters who think they might want to go with another onion&#8211;once my five cups of onions had sweated, melted, and carmelized, I had a sad little blob at the bottom of my Dutch oven, maybe a cup.  I did notice and like the teeny bit of raw onion in the bowl&#8211;it seemed to lift and brighten the flavor a bit.  What is saved in $ is lost in time, but there is something pleasingly meditative about watching onions go slowly, slowly gold right before your eyes.   Another keeper, Deb!  Thanks.</p>

				<p>I made this for dinner tonight! I used sweet onions because they are the only onions I actually like. I ended up using closer to 3 or 4 pounds of onions (around 8 1/2 cups at least). This had nothing to do with a concern over shrinking onions during the caramelization phase and everything to do with my own inability to accurately estimate how much the onions weighed and my grocery store&#8217;s inability to provide a scale since apparently the children of the neighbourhood played with it by hanging off of it until it broke&#8230; </p>
<p>It was incredible (I opted to use the brandy!). I only had one minor issue (well maybe two). The first problem I had was that I had so many onions (my own fault really) that there was simply no way to turn them around to coat them with the butter/oil for the initial cooking process (and I used the largest Le Creuset in my cupboard, 6.9L). I ended up drizzling them with olive oil and dropping a few extra butter bits on top so all the onions were actually coated at least a little bit. </p>
<p>The second issue was that 25 minutes into the caramelization process there was a lot of liquid in the pot and the onions were boiling in their own juices. I turned the heat up to a moderate high heat and boiled off the liquid as quickly as possible (this took about 15 minutes or so) and then reduced the heat to a smidge above medium for another 40 minutes to caramelize them fully (1 hour 20 mins total). I found that the onions required 40 minutes to fully caramelize even on a medium-high heat (after cooking off all the liquid). </p>
<p>This recipe is definitely a winner for me! Thanks for sharing and testing it out for us Deb!</p>

				<p>I cut this in half and made it with mushroom broth and it was delicious! Be careful with the salt, I love salt, but found this a little too salty in the end. When using mushroom broth, don&#8217;t be alarmed if it smells shroomy when you add it at first, when it simmers with the rest of the onions, it takes on the sweet oniony flavor really well. I didn&#8217;t use Cognac or Brandy, but used the wine and it was great, didn&#8217;t know what I was missing. I used sourdough bread and Gruyère which was a nice treat but didn&#8217;t really need it.</p>

				<p>I can&#8217;t believe I actually made this last night. It was some of the best French onion soup I&#8217;ve ever had! And *I* made it!! Somehow, your version didn&#8217;t terrify me the way other recipes have and I love that it wasn&#8217;t overly simplified to the point of not *really* being French onion soup anymore.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t really pull off the gratinee, though I tried (and also burned it&#8230; oops), but next time! For there WILL be a next time.</p>
<p>I want your cookbook to be out already so I can OWN IT.<br />

				<p>Oh my gosh, I was totally planning on making this next weekend. It&#8217;s been unseasonably cold up here in Maine lately, and I&#8217;ve never made onion soup before, so it seemed like perfect timing for it. I&#8217;ve been making my way through Julia Child and had settled on her recipe. I am so excited to try your streamlined version instead. Thank you!</p>

				<p>Absolutely incredible recipe.  Instead of beef stock I used duck stock (I happened to be making duck confit and thought this would be the perfect recipe to use up the remaining duck) which I simmered with thyme and used duck fat instead of butter.  This will be my go-to onion soup recipe, the onion flavour was perfect. I did top mine with bread and Gruyere and I also used the cognac so this was particularly rich, but perfect and exactly what I was looking for.  As always, thanks for posting, in the past 3 or so weeks I just check this website to see what I&#8217;m having for dinner ;)</p>

				<p>I just made this, it was delicious! Unfortunately my onions didn&#8217;t get a really really deep color&#8211; even after i cooked them for about an hour (I didn&#8217;t want them to get too mushy), but the taste was still amazing. What a great meal to make on a rainy spring day! I&#8217;d recommend adding the cognac as well, as it gives it a great rich finish.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve used this recipe since I received the original Child cookbook as a new wife. Cooking the onions to a mahogany color is the whole deal, and they won&#8217;t get &#8220;mushy&#8221; at all. You can&#8217;t get by with a pale roux if cooking creole or with pale onions in onion soup! No cheese or croutons for a low cal supper, or the whole gooey and delicious treatment to show off&#8211;this is delicious either way.</p>

				<p>I had the same problem as one other commenter &#8211; the onions are taking FOREVER to caramelize &#8212; about twice the time indicated.  I think that, in large part, it was because I had the heat WAY too low.  The recipe above says to steep them at a very low heat, and then to raise the heat SLIGHTLY when beginning the caramelization process.  I followed the directions to a T, as Deb is fantastic, but I&#8217;m wondering if the heat on my stove is just that different from others&#8217;&#8230; At any rate, I first turned the heat up to medium, and then to a bit above medium, and it FINALLY worked.  It was a long process, but completely worth the results.  Fantastic recipe.</p>

				<p>I had never made French Onion soup before.<br />
In fact, I wasn&#8217;t even really a big fan of it to begin with&#8230;too salty or bland usually.<br />
However, I read this blog and really was inspired to make it. I love onions so why wouldn&#8217;t I love this soup?<br />
I made it.<br />
It took me most of a night (after work) just to make the soup. The house still smelled like it in the morning too.<br />
I didnt actually &#8216;finish&#8217; the soup until 2 days later and it was phenomenal.<br />
The flavors really meshed while it sat in my fridge for 2 days.<br />
It wouldnt have been as stellar as it was if not for the Gratinee. Oh&#8230;since I didnt have over safe bowls, I took a baguette and put 4 slices in a circle and one in the middle, clumped them together on a baking sheet, liberally added the cheese on top and broiled for little under 2 min.<br />
I am now an onion soup eater!</p>

				<p>Did anyone else have trouble with the soup reducing too much? It&#8217;s entirely possible my burner is too hot, but I had it on the very lowest flame I could manage. I halved the recipe (probably my first problem) and had barely enough for two bowls&#8211;not much to show for all caramelizing work!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they were two very rich, very delicious, very wonderful bowls of soup. I only wish I had more for work on Monday. Next time: full recipe!</p>

				<p>This really was a labor of love, but the end result was amazing. My onions took forever to carmelize (more like 45+ mins) so next time I will bump up the heat a bit to speed things up for that portion. The only downfall is that when it comes out of the oven it is too hot to eat immediately. I kept trying anyway because it smelled so good and burnt my tongue a couple of times. We ate it with a shrimp caesar salad.</p>

				<p>My wife is not gonna be happy about this.  Lol, looks great, gonna give it a try. </p>
<p> &#8220;Kim&#8221; I saw you want to crank that heat up, be careful there. Shortcuts like that will get you in trouble. Sometimes low and slow is the best way to go.  You can always try a pan with more surface area to try and speed that process up.</p>

				<p>Recently stumbled upon your blog and absolutely LOVE it. I have made this soup 2 times in the past two weeks. My husband picked up a HUGE bag of yellow onions last week and when I asked why we needed so many onions he said, &#8220;For the soup of course!&#8221; Safe to say, it is a hit in this house. Thank you for sharing your talent and making your recipes so accesible.</p>

				<p>3 quick questions (unfortunately ctrl+F didn&#8217;t turn up anything):</p>
<p>1. Does using white instead of yellow onion alter the taste of the soup significantly?<br />
2. Is rum a good substitute for brandy/cognac? or should I leave this out instead of trying to add rum? I bake sweets a lot but don&#8217;t drink, so rum is the only alcohol I usually keep. And how long does brandy/cognac last once opened? does it only last weeks like wine or longer? I will only be using it for cooking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been itching to make this for weeks and promised myself I will make it once the final exams are over. Grr.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

				<p>Fanya &#8212; I prefer yellow onions. The white ones don&#8217;t have a flavor that holds up well to the long cooking time.  I&#8217;ve never tried this with rum but no reason not to. I don&#8217;t think that booze expires.</p>

				<p>Waahh, you respond too fast. Unable to resist the temptation, I made it today. The hardest part is not the long cook time. It is to STOP EATING THE ONIONS before putting the stock and wine in (I poured in the liquid before onion fully caramelized or else I&#8217;d stop right here and just eat all of it). I also distinctly remember having half stick of butter and some cheese in the fridge. Alas, that distinctive memory was a week ago, so I doubled the olive oil and skipped the butter. Don&#8217;t know if this is the cause, or if its cuz the onion I used were chopped a week ago cuz some of them started rotting. But the caramelizing onion part made them mushy. </p>
<p>I intended to half the recipe but forgot to half the wine. I didn&#8217;t know what beef stock smells like and was worried about my changes and the smell of the soup. Nonetheless, it was delicious. Will be making this again, with correct amount and butter and cheese.</p>
<p>4 cups of beef stock &#8211; $2.99<br />
A bit under 1 cup of wine (in a mini wine bottle) &#8211; $2.50<br />
Onion, bread and cheese are about the same. Yum.</p>

				<p>Just made this for dinner and it was delicious! I used the mushroom broth recipe from Mollie Katzen&#8217;s Vegetable heaven &#8211; 1lb of mushrooms, pkg of dried mushrooms, garlic &amp; thyme. So there was a nice hint of garlic and thyme to the onion soup without it being overly obvious.<br />
I&#8217;ve got all sorts of ideas for what I&#8217;m going to try next time I make this. Thank you so much for giving me such a great jumping off point to start experimenting with French Onion soup! It has always been one of my favorite things to order in a restaurant, but I&#8217;ve never even considered making it myself.</p>

				<p>p.s. Do not even think about skipping the Gruyere. 2 days later, soup&#8217;s even tastier than day 1. Finally brought the cheese ($6 and used half of the tiny block). Shredded and sprinkled it on top of the hot soup, and it brought the soup from yum to omg-delicious. (Total cost about $10 including cheese and makes 3 bowls, not bad).</p>

				<p>You would not believe how many people have had terrible french onion soup! I recently graduated last spring (2010) from culinary school and french onion soup was one of the dishes on my practical. The first time I ever had this served to me correctly, I was astonished how sweet the taste of the onion was! I never liked onions before, but caramelized onions are on a different subject. When made correctly, it should taste almost as sweet as a soy sauce.<br />
I have yet to try this recipe with a vegetarian &#8216;beef&#8217; stock, so this will definitely be the first recipe I will recreate once it gets cold again in Phoenix, AZ</p>

				<p>Made this AGAIN for dinner, with the Sally Lunn batter bread (made with less sugar, so not as sweet)&#8230;and it&#8217;s yummy wonderfulness. Don&#8217;t know why some commenters seem to think this isn&#8217;t economical. Gruyere is expensive, but I just grate and freeze it in ziplocks and a chunk will last me FOREVER&#8230;and still is much cheaper than a meat-based dish. People who don&#8217;t do wine need not shy away from the dish; just use a bit more stock or water. It&#8217;ll just lose a tad in flavor. </p>
<p>p.s. I sprinkle a bit of thyme on mine, right at the end, for that finishing touch!</p>

				<p>Some beef bouillon cubes do not actually contain any animal products, especially the lower-end cheap ones and ones that are labeled &#8220;beef flavored&#8221;. They can be used in a vegetarian soup, and are less expensive that many other options. Just read the ingredients list carefully. One thing to watch out for, though, is that they do contain an awful lot of salt and completely inorganic ingredients. If using full-salt bouillon, I recommend leaving out most of the additional salt called for in the recipe and/or buying low-salt cheese to top it with.</p>

				<p>Hi, I&#8217;m following your website for a few months now, and I must say, I&#8217;ve abandoned all of my cookbooks and only use your recipes. All the ones I&#8217;ve tried are spectacular (apple cake, shakshuka, etc.)!!<br />
Now, today, I&#8217;ve made this onion soup which I&#8217;ve been wanting to cook it since I stumbled upon your site. I&#8217;m from Luxembourg, a small country just on the upper border of France, so I know onion soup very well. My grandma used to cook it in a dutch oven since I can remember and it&#8217;s my absolute favourite.<br />
So now, while I was cooking, I was remembered the sweet scent of childhood &#8230; Thank you for that!  It was the best &#8220;soupe à l&#8217;oignon&#8221; I&#8217;ve ever eaten. (I hope that didn&#8217;t sound too dramatic, he he)<br />
Regarding the recipe: I actually did it with chicken stock, which isn&#8217;t brown, but it&#8217;s what we used to make it with, it goes well with the onions. The original french onion soup is topped with Gruyère, that has more flavour than Swiss and also goes well with the onions.<br />
Have a nice day!</p>

				<p>Made this today and it is delish!  I made it with my homemade chicken broth but otherwise followed the recipe.  I used dry sherry and finished it with brandy. I topped it with a combination of swiss and parmesan cheeses.  My husband, who is the real French Onion Soup person in our house said he actually perferred this made with the chicken broth to the traditional beef broth.  Thanks for another great recipe.</p>

				<p>I made this the other day! I adjusted a bit by using sherry, chicken stock I had on hand and adding a few shakes of Penzey&#8217;s Chicago steak seasoning (which added a hint of smoke flavor). I definitely didn&#8217;t skimp on caramelizing the onions for a full 45 minutes&#8230; and you&#8217;re right, its so worth it! Delicious. Thank you for sharing, Deb :)</p>

				<p>Hi Deb!  I&#8217;m throwing a French-Bistro 30th party for a friend.  She really wants French onion soup (who can blame her?) but there will be 12 of us and I&#8217;m not sure the best way to make this for a crowd.  Any reason I couldn&#8217;t get a big crock to float the cheese, raw onions and croutons in, top with cheese then bake and pop the whole thing on the table with a ladle?</p>

				<p>I am a nice (well sort of) Jewish girl, but when I have a cold it&#8217;s this soup I turn to, not chicken, though a lot of recipes DO call for chicken stock in this soup. But I like the beef version. I use &#8220;Minor&#8217;s&#8221; beef base, which I buy in BJ&#8217;s Warehouse&#8211;its main ingredient IS beef, which is often not the case in &#8220;bouillon&#8221; products.</p>
<p>I have made this recipe for years, first with Julia&#8217;s full method and in more recent years with my slow cooker. I think she&#8217;d have been fine with that&#8211;the more I&#8217;ve read about her the more I&#8217;ve seen how in producing &#8220;Mastering&#8221; she really looked at how Americans really cook.</p>
<p> I usually put the onions in the night before I want the soup and let them cook all night, making the house smell heavenly. And this spring I did an &#8220;April in Paris&#8221; lunch for the staff where I work. A staff member has a huge 8 quart slow cooker and I sliced (and cried over) 5 pounds of onions one evening before leaving them to slowly cook all night in the library kitchen. The next day, soup for a crowd, plus homemade breads. A big hit with the staff!</p>

				<p>Deb,</p>
<p>I made this TWICE a week ago. Magnificent! My roommates were clamoring for more.</p>
<p>I was shopping, and I wondered.</p>
<p>Did you know that, if you slice a cored cabbage thinly;<br />
and substitute &#8220;cabbage&#8221; for &#8220;onion&#8221; in your recipe;<br />
(and cook longer for fond),<br />
You&#8217;ve got a heavenly cabbage soup.</p>

				<p>This is the fourth recipe this week that I&#8217;ve made from your blog, and my family is actually enjoying my cooking- lol!  And that&#8217;s probably because I am enjoying cooking for a very rare change.  I feel like I&#8217;ve got a friend in the kitchen with me now! So, I made this with vegetarian stock and the brandy and it is yummy! I&#8217;m actually going to serve it tomorrow night with the cheese topping (didn&#8217;t budget enough time for dinner tonight&#8211; made the fish tacos in a jiffy). Hopefully it&#8217;ll taste just as good. I&#8217;m not worried! Yum! Thanks!</p>

				<p>This is going to sound really weird, but when I&#8217;ve made this soup or similar soups that beg for a rich beefy flavor, but I&#8217;ve only had chicken broth or lack-luster beef broth to work with, here&#8217;s what I do: I add a tiny amount (1/2-1 tsp each) of molasses, balsamic vinegar, and soy sauce. I know! Sounds gross. But those deep dark umami flavors really punch up the flavor of the broth, and you can&#8217;t pick them out in the final product.</p>

				<p>How am I supposed to make this if, as you say in your opening, I only have $5 to spend on dinner? That presumes alot. Onions, stock, cheese, wine and cognac? Please tell me in what country I can get all of that for $5 and I will move there right away! I couldn&#8217;t even get 1 of those things for under $5 in Canada&#8230;well maybe the onions but still&#8230;that statement presumes you already have alot of the ingredients&#8230;not a refrigerator that is &#8220;almost bare.&#8221; Ohhhh, you must mean rich people &#8220;almost bare&#8221; where you still have lots of cognac, wine and fancy cheese? You should think about what you say&#8230;I&#8217;m just sayin&#8217;!</p>

				<p>Hi Twee &#8212; The $5 is the cost of the <em>portion</em> of the ingredients you&#8217;d be using &#8212; the spoonfuls of Cognac, not the whole bottle. Brandy, which is cheaper, can also be used (as noted in the recipe). The alcohol is also optional.</p>

				<p>Nice recipe,  I make it similar to this but like to add whiskey for the cognac- slightly more smoky/rich flavor.  And provolone/mozz/jack to  top sourdough croutons.  Can&#8217;t go wrong :)</p>

Tonight, I will add the bread and cheese and I am sure we will have a wonderful dinner. Thank you for the recipe! Greetings from Amsterdam (Holland)</p>

				<p>I made this soup a couple of days ago from a very similar recipe (ATK) and the soup turned out noticeably sweet. What might have caused it? Over carmelizing? Dry Sherry rather than Vermouth? Would love your thoughts.</p>

				<p>Vicki &#8212; One of the not-so-pleasant secrets of French Onion Soup is that most contain quite a bit of salt. At restaurants, especially so, so if you&#8217;re trying to match it, you&#8217;ll need more than I suggest. It&#8217;s because caramelized onions have a lot of sugars in them (well, all onions do, caramelization pronounces it) so salt helps. Sherry is a bit sweeter, but I wouldn&#8217;t guess that it&#8217;s so much that it would throw the whole recipe. Hope that helps, or at least adds insight!</p>

				<p>Oh thank you and I&#8217;ll be back at it in a couple of weeks. The other thought that occurred to me is that it could be the type of stock I used. I&#8217;ll have to taste test to see if it tastes sweet on it&#8217;s own. And, if it is just the caramelization that sweetens, what about using lemon to counteract?</p>

				<p>I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. The only change I made was to add about 6 cups of stock instead of the 8 listed &#8211; if I had added the whole amount I would have had far too much &#8211; but it still turned out fabulously. I filled 8 smallish ramekins and they fed 4 hungry people.</p>

				<p>I just saw the episode of The French Chef where she makes this recipe the other day. And I was frustrated because she didn&#8217;t give the measurements on everything and I think the show was minimally edited-part way through she spills some brandy and just leaves most of it there while she continues to cook! So thank you so much for posting a streamlined version. One difference I notice though is she adds a little Worchestire and additional cognac at the end as a final &#8220;enrichment&#8221;. Have you tried this?</p>

				<p>Katelyn &#8212; Wow, I&#8217;ve never heard of using Worcestershire (btw, every time I spell the right upon first typing I give myself a high-five; I am a dork) but I like it. It would bring out the beefy/heartiness of it. But I&#8217;d go real easy on it because, of course, you cannot un-add it if you feel the flavor is too intense.</p>

				<p>Katelyn &#8212; Whoops! I hadn&#8217;t even realized you&#8217;d spelled it differently and hope I didn&#8217;t come off an applauding myself for correcting you, which would be pretty rude. I actually was delighted that for once I typed it without a squiggly red line showing up underneath it. It&#8217;s like the second time, ever. And yes, I did cheer myself. Let me know if you try it with the sauce; like I said, I think it could be delicious especially because I love the steakhouse vibe of the soup.</p>

				<p>Yum. Yum. Yum. I live in South Asia right now and my ingredient choices are limited. I&#8217;ve steered away from trying soups here because my broth/stock choices are limited to cheap bouillon cubes or making my own stock (something I don&#8217;t have enough forethought to do regularly). Tonight&#8217;s potluck theme is soups and stews, though, so I had to try something. I ended up making a quick (and weak) stock with some stew beef in the freezer and adding a little bit more flavor through two bouillon cubes. Even with the old-tasting red wine I had to use (can&#8217;t get alcohol here easily), the soup turned out DELICIOUS. I think the long caramelizing process for the onions really makes the flavors sing, even though I had to use mostly sub-par ingredients! Thanks so much for the inspiration.</p>

				<p>I just made this last night but the stock I used was too salty (only discovered this when sitting down to eat it. Arg!) That, and the following dialogue.</p>
<p>Boyfriend: &#8220;This tastes weird.&#8221;<br />
Me, tasting it: &#8220;It tastes like delicious, delicious, if salty, onion soup.&#8221;<br />
BF: &#8220;Oh, well I guess I just don&#8217;t like onion soup then.&#8221; </p>
<p>Aaand I had made a double recipe. Double arg!<br />
Do you have any suggestions for reducing the saltiness so at least I can enjoy the enormous pot I have left? Or using it as a base for another soup?<br />
I adore your site and cook from it all the time &#8211; LOVED your mom&#8217;s chocolate chip sour cream coffee cake. Haha, actually the BF and I had a big fight about the fact that I &#8220;called&#8221; the last slice (My defense: I made it! There would be no last slice if not for me!).<br />
Thanks!</p>

				<p>Usually I love your recipes but this one did not turn out :(<br />
I followed the recipe to the letter and&#8230;<br />
-the flour made it too mucky and well, floury<br />
-there were not enough onions and too much broth<br />
-the onions took over an hour to brown and they started breaking down so I had to pull them off before they got to a really nice golden brown.<br />
Not sure where I went wrong&#8230;I researched some other recipes which used 2lbs onions and 32 oz. broth&#8230;maybe those proportions are better? Less flour?</p>

				<p>For the love of soup. I have made this four times now. I am a vegetarian, so we use mushroom broth. We also are pretty loose with our onion measurements (as we love onions), and with the sugar (as we are from the south and sugar makes everything better). But from the first time (followed recipe to a tee) to the last time, LOVE this soup. My favorite thing to eat, period, by far. Last meal on Earth. And maybe a good baked potato. Thank you &#8211; you have given me a staple. And Sweet Jesus, what a staple it is.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve had this bookmarked since you posted it, and I finally made it the other day. Whoa! I just want to eat it always. =) Thanks for the great recipe!</p>
