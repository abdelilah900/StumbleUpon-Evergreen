January is always the time of year when most of us get caught up in the winter produce doldrums, fueled by the dearth of flavorful fruit and the overabundance of hard, starchy vegetables. But I find if I set my mind on citrus, I can carefully sidestep most bouts of Farmer&#8217;s Market Mourning. There are few things teeming with more promise of a sunnier tomorrow than sour-sweet piercing members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutaceae"><em>rutaceae</em> family</a>, and I&#8217;ve got an archive full of <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/04/longing-in-cookie-form">margarita cookies</a>, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/10/lemony-persnick">lemon bundts</a>, <A href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/09/this-cake-has-a-hole-in-it">orange chocolate chunks</a>, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/01/cake-paradisi">grapefruit loaves</a> and <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/09/in-praise-of-the-pocket-sized">key lime tartlets</a> that should assure you that you need not feel that you are missing out just because the peaches and berries have gone into hibernation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2169029414/" title="scrubbed lemons"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2238/2169029414_05957e22bf_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="scrubbed" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2169029866/" title="lemon zest"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2417/2169029866_f57b07e6f4_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="lemon zest" /></a></p>
<p>But I haven&#8217;t had a lemon bar in there before now, despite repeated requests and, heck, even pleading for one by various people inside my computer. You&#8217;d think it is because I&#8217;m stubborn but it actually that my bar (ha) for lemon bars has been set very high by my mother, who has an award-winning recipe somewhere in her files. Upon request, she sent it to me a couple years ago, but when they didn&#8217;t come out the way I had remembered, her response was &#8220;oh, I must have sent you the wrong one.&#8221; Tell me, if you had a recipe for lemon bars that you had won you a cooking contest, why would you have a second version in your box that wasn&#8217;t as good? Perhaps if you ask her, you&#8217;ll get further than I did.</p>

<p>This about brings us to New Years Eve, when I decided at the very last minute to make lemon bars, and with little time to get my mom to proffer up the correct recipe, went for Ina Garten&#8217;s widely-praised one instead. Guess what? They were almost as I remembered mom&#8217;s to be. &#8220;Almost.&#8221; The thing is, and this is really just me being really nit-picky, I have a personal taste for more of a 1:1 ratio between the shortbread base and quick lemon curd on top. The shortbread on these was just fine, but the topping a little&#8230; thick. (Also, soft, but I am certain that is because I should have baked it longer, or added <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/01/egg-volumes">an additional large egg</a>.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, with a few adjustments, I am certain my mother will approve of this recipe. It is tart, intense and deliciously contrasted with the cookie below, really the best of both worlds&#8211;and if you close your eyes and concentrate real hard, you might even forget that they&#8217;re calling for snow next week.</p>

<p><b>Related to exactly nothing:</b> Why did it take me like five days to post about lemon bars? Because I bought a new computer this weekend and its <em>hard</em> to adjust to writing on a <a href="http://www.apple.com/">new machine</a>. I&#8217;m not used to things being so &#8230; pretty. And running so quickly and not crashing a lot. I mean, what&#8217;s up with that?</p>
<p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/01/four-breakfasts/">English Muffins, Everyday Pancakes and Salad Lyonnaise</a>
<p><b>Lemon Bars</b><br />
Adapted from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0609602195?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0609602195">The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook</a></p>
<p>These are bold and tart lemon bars, ones I feel are best in smaller doses than Ina Garten suggests. I&#8217;ve made a few changes to the recipe&#8211;increased the salt in the crust, reduced the sugar in the lemon filling and an encouragement to grease your pan, as mine were all but cemented into their non-stick pan. For those of you who like the 1:1 crust to lemon layer ratio, use the second option.</p>
<p><u>For the crust: </u><br />
1/2 pound unsalted butter, at room temperature<br />
1/2 cup granulated sugar<br />
2 cups flour<br />
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
<p><u>For the full-size lemon layer: </u><br />
6 extra-large eggs at room temperature<br />
2 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br />
2 tablespoons grated lemon zest (4 to 6 lemons)<br />
1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice<br />
1 cup flour</p>
<p>Confectioners&#8217; sugar, for dusting</p>
<p><u>[Or] for a thinner lemon layer:</u></p>
<p>4 extra-large eggs at room temperature<br />
1 2/3 cups granulated sugar<br />
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest (3 to 4 lemons)<br />
2/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice<br />
2/3 cup flour</p>
<p>Confectioners&#8217; sugar, for dusting</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 350&#176;F and grease a 9 by 13 by 2-inch baking sheet.</p>
<p>For the crust, cream the butter and sugar until light in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Combine the flour and salt and, with the mixer on low, add to the butter until just mixed. Dump the dough onto a well-floured board and gather into a ball. Flatten the dough with floured hands and press it into the greased baking sheet, building up a 1/2-inch edge on all sides. Chill.</p>
<p>Bake the crust for 15 to 20 minutes, until very lightly browned. Let cool on a wire rack. Leave the oven on.</p>
<p>For the lemon layer, whisk together the eggs, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and flour. Pour over the crust and bake for 30 to 35 minutes (less if you are using the thinner topping), or about five minutes beyond the point where the filling is set. Let cool to room temperature.</p>
<p>Cut into triangles and dust with confectioners&#8217; sugar.</p>

				<p>There are about 452,005 Lutheran women in Minnesota who are slumbering with good dream because you posted a lemon bar recipe.  :)  But these bars look like they&#8217;d kick the bootay out of what I&#8217;m used to eating.  </p>
<p>You can bet your buttons I&#8217;ll  nominate your blog &#8211; love it.  Love it. </p>
<p>But I am quite jealous of you and your new machine.  It&#8217;s ok, though, you saved me now a couple of times when I&#8217;ve had to cook for a group.  People are still loving those brussell sprouts with capers&#8230;</p>

				<p>Citrus remains one of my most favorite things to create desserts with and that new microplane I have calls my name in the middle of the night. I must make these for dessert this weekend for a couple of friends. I only hope that they will appreciate them like I do!</p>
<p>Congrats on the Apple! My iBook was dropped on my bathroom floor a couple of weeks ago&#8230; oddly enough, right after reading one of your posts (see, it&#8217;s true what the readers say&#8230; they really are that good). I&#8217;ll be ordering a new MacBook later this week needless to say.</p>

				<p>Ina sure does know what she&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>When the lemon gets to be a little too&#8230; *lemony* I enjoy splitting all that lemon juice and zest with lime juice and zest. Makes it a little more complex.</p>
<p>Thank you for my weekend project!</p>

				<p>Yum!  I got a microplane for Xmas and have been waiting for a recipe to use it.  It just so happens that lemon bars are my favorite!  I guess it was meant to be :)  Also, loving your tip of the day!</p>

				<p>I KNEW IT !!  Pretty . . . running quickly . . . new machine . . . welcome.  I LOVE leopard.  Seriously.  I worship it.  I happen to be new to the apple world &#8211; no, not the food apple, the computer apple &#8211; and don&#8217;t know how I existed so long on a PC.  Enjoy!  Oh, and lemon bars happen to be one of my favoritest treats of all time &#8211; right behind good cheesecake or, God forbid, lemon cheesecake!  I can&#8217;t wait to try these.  All my friends now genuflect every time the Christmas cookies come up.  Thanks, Deb!</p>

They were perfect, delicious!  Also made the whole lemon tart-YUM!  And have told a dozen people about your blog.  Love your clean layout and the pictures are outstanding.  Keep at it!</p>

				<p>This recipe is being saved for use for a girls&#8217; night gathering I&#8217;m having in a couple of weeks. Thanks!</p>
<p>I had a tasty lemon bar recipe a few years back but it was completed beaten by a coworker&#8217;s recipe at some potluck event. Hers called for a smidgen of almond extract and it was amazing! I might have to halve your recipe (the light-on-the-lemon version) and try a bit o&#8217; almond in one half. </p>
<p>I still can&#8217;t believe she showed me up like that.</p>

				<p>Congratulations and welcome to the world of Mac, Deb.  Thanks for the truffle recipe &#8211; a hit.  Also, the espresso chocolate chip shortbread?  another hit.  I added crushed cornflake crumbs for some crunchy texture.  Folks were digging it :)</p>

				<p>are you annoyed with my helpful hints yet?</p>
<p>My favorite way to make lemon desserts more lemony is to pulse/ &#8220;grind&#8221; lemon (or any citrus) zest with sugar in food processor and then either 1. pass it through a tamis (=large flat sifter) if I need it right away or 2. let it sit for a long time and then pass whatever I&#8217;m making through a fine meshed sieve.</p>
<p>My own experience is that actual citrus zest is not terribly palatable, but the oils they release are magnificent.</p>
<p>Stunning photos, btw. I&#8217;ll hope they&#8217;re at flickr where I can call one of them my favorite&#8230;</p>

				<p>Flour in the lemon? ThatÃ‚Â´s new. IÃ‚Â´ve usually done it with corntarch, or just yolks as thickeners. Must try. Though of course thereÃ‚Â´s no thrill like the thrill of a new Mac, I bet a lemony rush is pretty good too, and I have some lemons I picked myself to use, which is always nice.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s weird how everyone gets these citrus cravings at this time of year. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s through a longing for Summer, but rather just because it&#8217;s so refreshing after all that stodge.</p>
<p>I love Lemon bars, and these are perfect.</p>

				<p>Oh yum yum yum! I love lemon anything. My favorite has always been lemon cheesecake but a good lemon bar isn&#8217;t anything to sneeze at! I can&#8217;t remember the last time I had a lemon bar so I suspect that means I should get busy making new memories&#8230;.haha</p>

				<p>I agree. I really think that people who make lemon bars and have some skintzy small layer of lemon are just&#8230; wrong! and the whole point of a lemon bar is to enjoy the whole lemon curd-ey-ness with the shortbread. </p>
<p>Now, on to the matter of your mother. Perhaps she didn&#8217;t want you having her prize-winning recipe, perhaps the thought of mother-daughter sabotage? (I jest, really I do. I just speak from bitterness that my grandmother didn&#8217;t share her shortbread nipple cookies before her death.)</p>

				<p>Hooray on the new computer- I&#8217;m a dedicated Mac user, laptop, iPhone, everything. While iPhoto is convenient, I find that when I upload my photos into iPhoto the colors are slightly dulled, whereas if I use Photoshop or PictureProject the colors are better. Don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve noticed the same thing&#8230;</p>

<p>Mercedes &#8212; I&#8217;m actually trying to figure out how to get my actually purchased (I know, who buys it) Photoshop Elements from my PC to my Mac. Yeah, not so much.</p>
<p>Unrelated, but: Anybody want to weigh in on what Word Processor they use? Use one of those pretty, new-fangled ones? I&#8217;m very used to Word, but it seems odd put it on a PC&#8211;I&#8217;d wait until the 15th anyway, when then next version comes out. I&#8217;m trying Google Docs for a few weeks, and no likey. </p>

				<p>Aii, lemon bars, the stuff of every church social EVER. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to make the Mac switch too and since so MANY in this comments have/are too, maybe you&#8217;ll some day do a non-food post. Over the weekend, the WSJ/maybe NYT had a piece about people &#8216;freeing&#8217; themselves from Word with something called <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html" rel="nofollow">Scrivener</a>.</p>

				<p>As far as word processing, the only thing that I would suggest is if you do any of your writing for work from home, get something compatible &#8211; yes, it may seem odd to load Office on your new Mac, but the thing is that Office is what a majority of the working world uses.  It would be kind of a hassle to have to download a program just to open Mac documents if I had a PC.</p>

				<p>Just a suggestion, but can you make it so that your &#8216;links&#8217; when exited, do NOT exit your site. I do that on my site, and that way when someone leaves a &#8216;link&#8217; they automatically go back to the original site. Now when I exit out of a link, unless I go &#8216;back&#8217;, I&#8217;m out of smittenkitchen altogether.<br />

				<p>How timely! We&#8217;re hosting a Nancy Drew themed 12th birthday party in 2 weeks. In the ND movie released this summer, ND&#8217;s lemon squares are either her or her housekeeper&#8217;s signiture snack. It&#8217;s used to coerce reluctant witnesses to spill their guts. We&#8217;ll definately try this for the party.<br />

				<p>I am in love!  I tried out various lemon bar recipes in college.  I had just started cooking and did not have my trustworthy recipes from my favorite people yet.  I tried lemon bars three times and gave up.  To this day, it&#8217;s the only time I did not follow through with my own test kitchen type trial.  THANK YOU!  I am sure this will do the trick.  Can&#8217;t wait to make these.</p>

AND i got a new mac for christmas too!  i&#8217;m obsessed with the screen &#8212; everything looks so pretty!  my old law school laptop was definitely on its last legs. :-)</p>

				<p>You&#8217;re my new love Deb.  The photos! the recipes! the WRITING!  I discovered your blog just before Christmas when I was researching the Cook&#8217;s Illustrated pie dough.  Yeah, the one with the Vodka.  :)  Since then I have become completely enamoured.  </p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been using Mac&#8217;s since 1984, and I can tell you that I&#8217;ve always used Microsoft WORD as my word processor.  Loading Office into your Mac will be one of the simplest things you&#8217;ve ever done.  That being said, when I purchased my current Macbook, I also purchased Apple&#8217;s &#8220;iWork&#8221;.  The word processing and the spreadsheet programs are so well done&#8230;  I&#8217;ve found myself using Pages, and Numbers for most of my heavy lifting now.  When they go out I send them out as Word or Excel files.  (No one knows ;)</p>
<p>Thank you so much for a wonderful website. Now I&#8217;m so hungry I&#8217;m gonna try the lemon, chicken, mushroom, goulash, empanadas&#8230; ;P</p>

				<p>I have an excellent Whole Lemon Tart recipe here: <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/06/two-of-tarts/" rel="nofollow">http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/06/two-of-tarts/</a> and I bet it would work wonderfully on a shortbread base. I&#8217;d probably halve the shortbread recipe above, press it into an 8&#8243; square and use the whole lemon topping instead.  Do let me know if you try it. I have been eager to, myself.</p>

				<p>Would it be awfully mean of me if I just happened to mention that because we have had a warmer than usual winter the strawberries are coming into season a month early here in Fl? </p>
<p>Oh, it would then I won&#8217;t say anything of the kind to all of you people up north. </p>
<p>You know I don&#8217;t think I have ever had a lemon bar? Hmm, might have to make some to see what all of the fuss is about. Would it be sacreligious if I topped each one with a strawberry slice, after baking, or some strawberry juice drizzled on top? I just love the strawberry lemonade flavor combo.</p>

(Did you see the greens with cornmeal dumplings, featherlight yeast rolls, cream of cope&#8217;s corn soup, fresh coconut cake and mile-high chocolate cake?)  I digress.  These bars look absolutely yummy.  I like mine good and tart, so thanks for the modifications.</p>

				<p>I am a fan of the 1:1 ratio, too. In nearly any tart, bar, or other fruit-related recipe, I like the cookie, crust, or crumble part better than the filling, and I also don&#8217;t like any of it to be all that sweet. </p>
<p>And these are great! So buttery. I used less filling.</p>

				<p>Maureen &#8212; Though many people go by the 4 lemons = 1 cup equation, lemons range so widely in size and how much juice is within them, I always feel safer buying an extra one or two. When I made these, I ended up with super-juicy lemons, and think I was able to get 1 cup from 3.5 of them (also with an electric juicer, which is more thorough). Hope that helps.</p>

				<p>I can be so dense sometimes (thumping myself on the head)!  I love lemon bars (or squares, as we call them)!  I have gobs of gorgeous lemons dropping off of the lemon tree in my backyard.  Why, oh why, am I filling ice cube trays with lemon juice instead of making these beauties?</p>

				<p>DEB! You&#8217;ve got me hooked on your blog! I am definately voting for you. As for this recipe, my sis-in-law has been asking me to try lemon bars out (she loves them). So this recipe is definately being saved up in my to-do list!<br />
Your blog and your pics are extremely inspiring and keep me coming back for more every day!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m also a Mac user and have used nothing but Office for my word processing.  It&#8217;s really easy to use (the fact that I was able to buy it for $25 with my student discount did not hurt either though).  </p>
<p>Enough of that though &#8211; these bars look amazing!  I&#8217;m not big into chocolate so these are right up my alley.</p>

				<p>Hey glad to see your got a mac. I&#8217;ve been using one for about 5 years (Biologists love macs). In my opinion, even better than how awesome the products is, is how awesome the mac zealots are. If you had said you got a PC there would not be this outpouring of excitement and congratulations; all the mac people I&#8217;ve ever met are always willing to help you with any problem you may have, just because of their love affair with the mac. So, welcome to the club!</p>
<p>Onto more culinary affairs, I tried this recipe this evening (literally its still cooling) but it does not seem to have to have come out just right. I tried the full topping but the filling seems to have come out very opaque not translucent and bright light yours. Even more there seems to have developed a very thin crust. I&#8217;m sure it will still taste amazing, but any ideas on what happened? Too much flour, too hot too long? The scientist in me needs to know, thanks!</p>

				<p>I was drooling over this recipe on your site all afternoon yesterday. When I went home last night, I was flipping through my new Crate and Barrel catalog and surprise! They are selling a boxed mix of this exact Barefoot Contessa recipe! For $10 freakin&#8217; dollars though. I&#8217;d rather make it from scratch for that kind of money.</p>

				<p>Mmmm.  Macs and lemon bars.  They do inspire such deep devotion.  And I too, am a complete devotÃƒÂ©e &#8212; of both.  Specially since my husband just bought me a new MacBook for ChristmaHanuKwanzaakah.  </p>
<p>These lemon bars look completely luscious.  Can you forgive me if, unsolicited, I share with you my absolute all-time favorite version?  It&#8217;s Rose Levy Beranbaum&#8217;s Ultimate Lemon Butter Bar.  They come closer to your favored ratio of cookie crust to lemon curd, but they&#8217;re a bit more labor-intensive, requiring cooking the lemon curd before you bake it onto the pre-baked shortbread crust &#8212;  and they are so, so worth it.  Just give the recipe a look (or maybe an actual try):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/105890" rel="nofollow">http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/105890</a></p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t get too crazy with it.  Like, I skip the step of straining the lemon curd, &#8216;cos I&#8217;m lazy and I don&#8217;t mind the little lemon zest strings, but they are still unbelievable lemon bars.</p>

				<p>Julie &#8212; Great minds! I was hoping to take a crack at Rose Levy&#8217;s next. I know it has a lot of steps, but I suspect that it is at least as awesome as the gushing commenters suggest. I do try not to get put off by her oh-so-needly instructions; it&#8217;s rarely as complicated as she makes it sound.</p>

<p>as for the word processing &#8230; i have iworks, but since everything else (work and school papers) are office, i got the office version for mac. i would not bother with getting bootcamp unless absolutely positively necessary for some other program.</p>

				<p>We got office for the Mac when we made the switch from our PC.  It&#8217;s great to use, except for the few keystroke combinations I still can&#8217;t seem to figure out for the Mac.  I&#8217;m working around that, though and am now a definite Mac devotee.  I may have to give these lemon bars a try this weekend.  Although my diet is shouting &#8220;NO&#8221; in my ear.  I may have to wait for my birthday later in the month for the splurge. Lemon bars beat out birthday cake any day of the week.</p>

				<p>I made Meyer lemon bars today following the recipe in the <a href="http://www.burghilicious.com/2008/01/oreo-cookies-killed-my-mixer.html" rel="nofollow">Oreo Cookie cookbook</a> that has been so inspiring for many of us! Though the recipe called for regular lemons, the Meyer lemon gave the custard the slightest orange glimmer of both flavor and color. The recipe in Brachman&#8217;s book yields a mighty-tart, salivation-inducing cookie that is positively addictive. Fortunately, the recipe is for a 7&#215;11 inch pan &#8211; perfect for a family of two!</p>

				<p>I made these lemon bars with a friend today. Living in Denmark, neither of had ever heard of it (is it American?), but now we&#8217;re hooked! They were so delicious. But really fils you up quickly.<br />
We almost doubled the baking time, though (made the thick layer). After 35 minutes the lemon layer was still completely fluid&#8230;</p>

				<p>Made a batch yesterday on a large baking sheet using Meyer lemons from a friend&#8217;s tree to contribute to the <a>Heather Gold show</a>  &#8211; she encourages baking treats in trade for admission.  Luckily for us the audience was moderate in size, and not ravenous; we got to bring a few odd shaped pieces from the corners home.  </p>
<p>Oh, I made the crust with half almond meal which accomplishes some of what Robin (comment 10) was aiming at with almond extract.</p>

				<p>Thanks for another winner, Deb!  I&#8217;ve had these bookmarked for a long time, just waiting for the perfect opportunity.  My husband doesn&#8217;t really love lemon bars, so I wanted to make sure I could take them to a party where there would be tons of other desserts for him.  Tonight was that party&#8211;and they were a SMASH HIT!  Everyone loved them&#8211;including my husband (!) and a co-worker who says she is a self-confessed lemon bar expert (she had four or five of them).</p>
<p>They are perfect&#8211;not too tart, not too sweet&#8211;and really easy to make, actually (I made the thinner layer of lemon, and they were awesome).  An impressive dessert!  :)  Thanks again!</p>

				<p>My mother has a meyer lemon tree and keeps giving me lemons. What to do when life gives you lemons? Make lemon bars. They turned out amazing and everybody keeps asking for more. A hit again and again! BTW, I went for the 1:1 ratio version. I prefer that as it&#8217;s not too top heavy.</p>

				<p>this recipe is terrific! i baked some lemon bars following this exact recipe (with the thinner lemon top), and they were amazing!  I would suggest using a little less flour in the top layer just to make them a little less dough-ey.  But they were a complete hit and disappeared as soon as i took em out of the oven.</p>

				<p>After reading some of the responses, I feel guilty saying that I have the good fortune to live in California and have two Meyer lemon trees in my backyard.  I love Ina Garten and her Barefoot Contessa series, but you have out done her with these lemon bars.  Her lemon bars are one of the very few things of hers that I have tried and not liked.  I love the 1:1 lemon curd to shortbread ratio.  Even my picky boys loved them because they weren&#8217;t as tart nor &#8217;slimey&#8217; (read gooey in boy speak).<br />
Love your blog.  I like that you are inspired by the same chef folks as me ie Dorie Greenspan, Ina etc.  You have my dream job&#8211;cooking for a living but without the unsociable hours of restaurant/cafe/bakery life.  Plus, you make me laugh.  Keep up the great work!</p>

				<p>delicious! i made these recently and they tasted fabulous. but for some reason, the lemon layer wouldn&#8217;t stick to the shortbread, which was frustrating. i may have overbaked them&#8230;is this a possible explanation for what went wrong? thanks!</p>

				<p>Hello there!<br />
I tried making lemon bars but i had trouble taking them out of the pan after they were cooled. I did butter the pan before pouring in the filling&#8230;is there anything I missed here? Is there a baking secret to be able to easily remove the lemon bars out of the pan? Thanks so much!!</p>

				<p>I have some modifications to this recipe, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s perfect.</p>
<p>First, the sugar quantity needs to be determined each time. Juice the requred amount of lemon (say, 2/3 cup), and set aside x2 the lemon quantity. After whisking the egg well, add lemon juice &amp; zest, then add sugar. Start by adding the first half (2/3 cup), then taste, and keep adding until it&#8217;s right for you. Note that you&#8217;re eating raw egg, so if you&#8217;ve got health reasons, get your SO or child or ignore me.</p>
<p>Second, the amount of flour in the filling is *much* higher than similar recipes, and should be reduced. I prefer a little lemon crust, and a little &#8220;gel&#8221; feel in the middle. That seems to be closer to 1/2 cup in the small version. Probably you need to fiddle with this a little.</p>
<p>Third, to those having trouble getting their lemon bars out, the answer is always baking parchment. Cut to fit the bottom, don&#8217;t go up the sides. Enjoy.</p>

				<p>So I needed a great dessert to take to our monthly dinner club (10 friends, 1 house, various babies &amp; animals, and always a theme).  The theme was &#8216;Welcome Summer&#8217;, with clams, mussels &amp; crabs, corn on the cob, summer salad and seabreezes for those who were alcoholically inclined (that would be all of us save the 2 pregnant ones).  These lemon bars were PERFECT &#8211; sunny, slightly sour, chewy &amp; tasted like biting into a fresh lemon!  I made them using the thicker version and while I did have some crust challenges but with a little creativity, all was well.  (I also made a fresh raspberry sauce to pour on the base of the plate) And best of all, the raves and compliments were almost never-ending and every one of us cleaned our plates within about 6 minutes&#8230;I think that qualifies as an unparalleled success!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,</p>
<p>I made these last night, half portion and it turned out great! My husband who is not a lemon person was impressed. I liked the thinner lemon layer.</p>
<p>I do have a question. A thin layer of &#8220;crust&#8221; formed on top of the lemon layer. It made it look like a cake. Fortunately, the flavor was not affected. Could it be because there were too much bubbles in my mix?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Charlotte</p>

				<p>I just took this out of the oven and also has a cakey looking top.  I was afraid I over whisked&#8230; Right now, I&#8217;m waiting for the tray to cool before digging in and trying it out.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve never made lemon bars before and decided to try this recipe. They were the ABSOLUTE BEST I&#8217;ve ever ever ever had! Thanks so much for posting this! It was so simple too! I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever buy another lemon bar again. My daughter who isn&#8217;t a huge fan of lemon bars even loved them! Thanks again! :)</p>

				<p>I followed your directions to the letter, and ended up with perfect lemon bars. Buttery shortbread bottom, and a lemon filling with the ideal texture. My southern grandmother would be so proud, and my co-workers loved them:-)  Thanks for another amazing recipe!</p>

				<p>I love lemon bars, so I had to try this recipe.  The result were not the best: I liked the crust, but the lemon layer was rubberize and too dense.  It was the flour? I was hopping for a creamy lemon layer, not even close.  What should I change?</p>

				<p>Just harvested (1 hr ago) 2 bright Meyer(s) lemons from a happy little tree that had been dormant for about 4 years.  They are the first, and I want to do the best for them.  This recipe looks nice, but the proportions on this (and many other) recipe throw me off  . .   have only (2), and they&#8217;re sooo beautiful!!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made these four times now (my husband and friends are citrus freaks), and other than the first batch, when I overbaked the base and burned the edges, there&#8217;ve been nothing but positive comments on them. I do wonder why they come out a tad cakey on top and then gooier in the middle, but as no one seems to have a problem with the texture, I don&#8217;t care either. Thank you, Deb!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve had lots of lemon squares before, but this is by far the best! So sweet and lemon-y! One word to the wise, tho &#8211; don&#8217;t make a double-batch in a large cookie tray, because you WILL end up eating the whole thing, and you&#8217;re waistline will be the worse for it.</p>
<p>I re-found this recipe from the recently-posted poppy seed lemon cake, which I&#8217;ll be making this afternoon. Hopefully that one lives up to the expectations that these squares have raised!</p>

				<p>My microplane Christmas present finally got some use! Although I zested only 2 large lemons and got more that enough zest for this recipe and the lemon-cranberry scones. These are wonderful! I slightly over-pre-baked the crust, so the top edges were a bit brown, but they are amazing! Tart, great texture, perfect crust! A day later, they are neither soggy nor gooey nor gummy, as many lemon bars become. As I&#8217;ve done before, I poured the crust crumbles directly into the pan and used the outside thumb knuckle to press the sides evenly, then pressed the remainder into the bottom.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve loved lemon bars for as long as I could remember, but couldn&#8217;t bring myself to try the boxed mixes and always thought it was going to be way too complicated to even try from scratch. SO wrong! I used the modified version  (thank you SO much for that) with some meyer lemons and they turned out great! The only issue is that I think my pan might&#8217;ve been a little too big or that either my hands or the dough were too warm, so I had a hard time getting the crust pressed evenly in the pan and the edge pieces show it (they are definitely still edible though). The modified recipe is the perfect crust to filling ratio for me, is nice and tart and I will definitely be telling friends about it. I&#8217;m also excited to try it with regular lemons for a little extra pucker. Oh, and the final cooking time for me with the modified filling recipe was 15-20 minutes.</p>

				<p>These were a disaster! I wish I knew what I did wrong, but I made this nice wall in the dough and then the lemon topping (thin version) spilled out all over the cookie sheet, the oven, the counters, the floor. So I tried to take the whole mess and put it in a ready made pie shell (for shame, but to save the topping at least). But the pie shell was too old and dry, so it crumbled, I then took the crust from the ruined bar recipe with a bit of topping and plopped it all in a pie dish, then put the rest of the topping on top of it, and baked it lower and longer than called for and VIOLA, my husband and daughters claim the most delicious lemon pie they&#8217;ve ever tasted.<br />
Where did I go wrong, I just had not enough dough to make the crust I think? It&#8217;s all o.k. in the end, but that topping went EVERYWHERE.</p>

				<p>Oh, Deb, your lemon bars look lovely&#8230;and unfortunately, nothing at all like mine turned out to be.</p>
<p>I decided to make the thinner layer of filling. First of all (and this is only a minor complaint, and probably my fault) I had a hard time getting the crust to come together. It&#8217;s most likely due to my inexperience with crusts like this, but it was awfully crumbly and lost its shape quite a bit during the first browning. But secondly, I, like a few others on here, had a sticky, cake-like top. It&#8217;s quite annoying&#8211;where do I put the powdered sugar if there&#8217;s no sticky layer to adhere to? And this top layer tastes very sickly-sweet, I&#8217;m tempted to knife it off before the company arrives&#8230;do you have any ideas what I could do differently to avoid this in the future? If not, I&#8217;ll (unfortunately) have to write this recipe off and move on to another lemon bar recipe.</p>

				<p>Love this recipe. Works perfectly for me, no hitches, using a heavy ceramic baking dish I normally use for baking lasagne&#8217;s, etc. For greasing the pan, I used Canola Oil spray and gave the entire pan a heavy dose. Worked very well. I found that a tiny bit more sugar in the crust (making it the second time) was a lively, pleasant enhancement. This recipe is delicious and after 2 days covered tightly in the fridge, the cutting became easier with each section and the bars were even more tasty.Time is on the side of this recipe.The bars stayed very fresh tasting for 5 days in the fridge. I suspect they would last even longer with no issues, so long as kept in an air tight container in the fridge. Second time around, I added an additional 1/3 c of lemon juice. Simply love the tart/sweet combination and it worked well, not being too tart for our tastes. There is plenty of sugar in this recipe so a little extra lemon did no harm at all. Thanks for your efforts at risking an adjustment to Ina Garten&#8217;s recipe. I loved her&#8217;s too, but this one suits our tastes more.</p>

				<p>A neighbor gave me a bag of lemons the other day and I had to make some lemon bars to thank her and for us too.  I had made these as written for the large batch last year and didn&#8217;t love them, but I liked the base.  My recipe uses powdered sugar and it has a too &#8216;melt in the mouth&#8217; feel .  I like a little bit of strength  in shortbread bases, so this one worked well.  The topping of this recipe is too, uh..gloopy?  It&#8217;s not curd-ish and translucent enough.  It think Ina has way too much flour in it.  So, I was guided by my topping, which is very similar to this small batch here but made it 9&#215;13 (4 eggs,2 c sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/3 cup juice.  Bake 15-20 mins) and I incorporated Shuna&#8217;s tip of rubbing the sugar with the zest instead of grating  it in..I agree with her explanation, especially in a topping like this (even Thos Keller does this in his lemon sabayon, which is scrumptious).  The bars were perfect 1:1 topping to base.  Even though I changed it up, I always come here first and use what I find for inspiration.  I trust your adaptations that much!</p>

				<p>I just wanted to say thank you for this recipe! I did the 1:1 ratio (though I might try the top-heavy one next time) and it turned out great! I&#8217;m kind of a novice baker, and other lemon bar recipes didn&#8217;t work for whatever reason, so this was huge. Thanks a million! :)</p>

				<p>I made these about a month ago and they were so good I&#8217;ve been thinking about them since! i used the fuller layer of lemon and didn&#8217;t put powdered sugar on them (out of laziness) and they were PERFECT! i don&#8217;t cook much but i know i can always trust your recipes to be economical, practical, pretty, and DELICIOUS!</p>

				<p>I finally tried these, and I have to say for an Ina Garten recipe they are a bit underwhelming.  Crust is too blah (I like the idea someone suggested of getting some almond in there).  It would have helped if I had used the full 1 C lemon juice (I misread the recipe and used somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4C; but I also prob didn&#8217;t have enough lemons &#8211; try 6-8!).  But the real deal breaker is all the flour in the filling (yeah, more liquid would have helped.)  Just too thick and jelly-like, in the sense of fruit slices.  I want the lemon layer to be softer, more like lemon curd.  I think I&#8217;m going to have to revisit Lee Bailey&#8217;s lemon bar, and see how Patricia Well&#8217;s lemon lovers tart filling would work.</p>

				<p>I couldn’t believe that Ina’s lemon bars were such a dud, so I remade with the correct amount of lemon juice. What. A. Difference. A powerful jolt of lemon. I still believe that there is too much flour (I used 1 C sifted the 2nd time), so I’m going to up the egg and severely reduce the flour a la Lee Bailey’s. I’m also going to use powdered sugar in the crust, and vanilla &amp; almond extract a la Patricia Well’s lemon lovers tart. Meanwhile, my friends are happy to eat the (failed) experiments.</p>

				<p>I needed a tart lemon bar recipe on the fly late last night and found your post.  I made the recipe with the full-size lemon layer.  I didn&#8217;t have 6 extra large eggs, so I used 7 large eggs.  I lined my pan with parchment paper, so I didn&#8217;t have to add any kind of &#8220;lubricant&#8221; to the pan.  It helped with clean up too!  I let the dough cool in the fridge overnight and baked everything this morning.  The whole dessert was (carefully) lifted right out of the pan by the parchment edges after it cooled to room temp.  The bars came out PERFECTLY and were quickly devoured by office co-workers.  I will definitely make these again in the future.  </p>
<p>While the balance is just right and there is no need for adjustment; I will cut back on the sugar in the filling next time because my tastebuds favor more tart than sweet.  Thanks again for the fantastic recipe!</p>

				<p>Made these last night.  Boobooed on the crust; didn&#8217;t read the directions and threw everything in the bowl and mixed it up.  They still came out awesome.  I too used the cross parchment technique in the pan (thanks Joepastry).  I did spray it with Pam.  The bars lifted right out of the pan; making them oh so easy to cut up. I cut them in triangles like the recipe suggested.  They look so pretty; I can&#8217;t wait to serve them tonight.  (Cutting them in triangles gave me some yummy edges to test)</p>

				<p>Okay Deb..I have to comment (again) since it didn&#8217;t sound like this was your ideal recipe, either.  I made another batch of lemon bars yesterday (got another huge bag of Eureka lemons from the neighbor) and used this base again, but used the topping recipe for Lemon Bars from the Better Homes and Gardens website recipe index.  It was wonderful &#8211; AND &#8211; it only used 4 eggs, 3 tablespoons of flour (yes! only 3 tbsp flour!)  to 3/4 of a cup of lemon juice, plus 1/4 cup half and half.  once cooled completely, it finished to a transluscent bright yellow, as a lemon filling should look &#8211; and it set up perfectly for clean edged cuts.   You&#8217;d never know there was a milk product in it either.  It could use more lemon rind than the recipe calls for if you like a very tart lemon flavor.  I don&#8217;t, so it was perfect for me..not too sweet at all, but not mouth-puckeringly tart either.  It had only a slightly thicker topping than base..slightly!</p>

				<p>Made these today with the full-size lemon layer, but with just 2 c. sugar.  They were very good, but a bit firm.  Will reduce the flour substantially next time.  What I appreciate most about this recipe is that it is delicious while easier/quicker than the Cooks Illustrated recipe (which is my favorite).</p>

				<p>Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe, Deb! I made it and it was a huge success! I even translated it into portuguese and published it in my blog, adding a link to your recipe. Easy and delicious!<br />

				<p>Hate to be critical/make a request because i LOVE your blog, it is my without fail stop when I need a recipe, but just wondering if you could please add how many servings the recipes yield. I often make your desserts for parties etc. but am never sure if I&#8217;ll need to double&#8230;.thanks</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t do a lot of serving suggestions because I&#8217;ve learned I cut things much smaller than others. It&#8217;s a 9&#215;13 pan. I often cut things 1.5&#8243;x2&#8243; and get 36. I think 20 to 24 is a more common size. It is really up to you.</p>

				<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder- is there such a thing a recipe for lemon bars that calls yolks in the filling, and the whites from those very same eggs to make a meringue topping?</p>

				<p>Yay!  Made these today.  I made the thicker lemon layer and used half the lemon zest and probably about 1/8 of a cup less flour in the filling and they came out great.  They did have a cakey looking layer on the top, but didn&#8217;t taste weird at all.  Once the powdered sugar is on top, they look nice again, too.  Also&#8211;used Bob&#8217;s Red Mill gluten free flour mix for the crust and filling and it worked fabulously&#8230;</p>

				<p>for me it was a  disaster as jenine said. THE CRUST crumbled with me too i do not know what goes wrong and it was too salty , THE LEMON CURD a little bit citrus but it was good at some part there was a very thin rubbery layer, white in color but creamy consistence and when i cut it it seems as the curd is separated from the crust, it keeps getting off.  i know i have done something wrong so please tell me whatcould i have done to avoid this?</p>

				<p>Clearly, I&#8217;m missing something here&#8230;when I made the lemon squares and baked them, my lemon filling never quite came together, resulting in a flowing gush of lemon goo all over my coat.  By the time all was said and done, I&#8217;d baked them for over 45 minutes with no progress.  Part of me is wondering whether I attempted to move them too soon, or if the flour wasn&#8217;t integrated enough.  Ina Garten&#8217;s never failed me before, so I&#8217;m wondering where I went wrong.</p>

				<p>I hate you a little for this. I just made these for Christmas cookie tins, and they are too good. I&#8217;m sure my friends aren&#8217;t that great. Surely they don&#8217;t deserve these lovely bars made from my very own lemons? How bad would it be if I ate the whole pan?</p>

				<p>I made these today and found them disappointing. I made the thinner lemon layer, which was hardly very lemony at all, and almost too sweet. I also think they were rather cake-like (too much flour). The crust was completely overpowering. Next time I will try a different recipe.</p>

				<p>Huge fan of lemon bars.  Tried this recipe, tweaked it a bit by using the Home and Gardens filling from Susan (#111) and then put about a cup of walnuts into my crust (put them in the processor with the other crust ingredients.  My wife and daughter who are entirely picky about their lemon bars, loved them.  Actually, I loved them too.</p>

				<p>I adore this lemon bar recipe! (Don&#8217;t tell my mom, but it&#8217;s replacing her tried-and-true as my definitional lemon bar recipe&#8230; eek! Sorry Mom!)</p>
<p>But. I have bags and bags of oranges from my backyard&#8211;and am not finding a lot of orange-centric recipes to use them up (Orange Chocolate Chunk Cake notwithstanding). So &#8230; I&#8217;m thinking about swapping out the lemons for oranges. I&#8217;m guess this should NOT be a 1:1 swap, since oranges are more bitter than lemons and less sour&#8230; Any ideas or suggestions about using oranges in this recipe before I embark on this experiment? Thanks!</p>

				<p>These are definitely good as a king of cookie (i made the thinner top), but not my holy grail lemon bar. I do like a little bit more give, not quite such a rock solid base, and too much flour in the lemon top. I&#8217;m going to try some of those suggested here next time. The CI recipe with cream looks like it&#8217;s on the right track since a curd typically has butter in it. Good recipe for my first attempt at a lemon bar though. Thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>I made these using the whole lemon adaptation for the topping as Deb suggested (#36). They were delicious and really easy! I only have a 9 inch square pan so I did a 5/8 recipe of the shortbread crust (I started with a half recipe then realized I needed a little bit more crust). I baked the crust as directed, then added the lemon topping and followed the baking directions for the whole lemon tart. I think the baking times worked well.<br />
    One last note, since the ratio of topping to crust is crucial to many lemon bar fans, the crust to topping ratio seemed to be in the middle of the two options given for this recipe (from the way that I made the bars). The amount of crust and size of pan could easily be adjusted though based on preference. Thanks Deb for all of your great recipes and suggestions!</p>

				<p>These are off the charts amazing! I&#8217;m a military wife, and I added these to a bunch of goodies I sent to Marines friends stationed overseas, and off all the sweets (and I sent a vast array), these were fought over. Now that they are back home, I&#8217;m getting regular requests to ship these to their units stationed here. I love your recipes so much, I have never had a miss. Right now, I have a batch of homemade oreos and espresso chocolate cookies waiting to be packed up with the lemon bars for a trip to my friends. Please keep them coming! Love, love, love your blog!</p>

				<p>I have never had a lemon bar before but after reading about them (drooling over these) for months, I finally bought my first lemon bar at one of my favorite bakeries yesterday and found that I was extremely disappointed. The top was completely bombarded with confectioners sugar (a snowstorm of sugar flew about when I shook it) and the lemon &#8220;curd&#8221; part tasted like an overly processed, chewy sugar mixture with no lemon-ness to it at all. And to make matters worst, the crust was barely there and tasted worst than a pre-packaged crust. Should I put my faith into these?</p>

				<p>I made these today, and they aren&#8217;t quite right. The filling is almost rubbery, and the lemon section and shortbread separated when I cut them. Any thoughts why? I followed the recipe for full topping completely, only cutting the flour to 5/6 of a cup. I was looking for more of a gel-like consistency.</p>

				<p>Hello Deb,<br />
I Tried this recipe yesterday, and it didn&#8217;t quite turn out as I expected.<br />
As Sarah said (2 comment above me), the lemon-layer is nearly rubbery-like and it separates from the crust when cut. I followed the recipe completely.<br />
I think I might have over-baked it&#8230; I can&#8217;t think of another reason, can you?<br />
Maybe I just expected something else, that&#8217;s all. </p>
<p>Yet, the pictures are great(!!!) and I surely will be exploring your site and trying more recipes.</p>

				<p>These were great! When I made them, my roommate and I had bought a bunch of cranberries to decorate our teeny tiny Christmas tree in our apartment and with my surplus of cranberries &#8211; I decided to make a cranberry curd as the bottom layer in these bars. The combination of meyer lemons and fresh cranberries was delish!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb-<br />
I&#8217;ve made this a few times now and have settled on an amount of filling just between your two (ie, 5 eggs!)  I have two questions.  The first is: when you measure lemon rind, do you pack it down like brown sugar because the amount would vary greatly if you did not.  But packed, it is a LOT.  Second: what does 5 minutes past the point when it&#8217;s set mean?  It&#8217;s hard to &#8220;see&#8221; set here because there is a sort of foamy white look on top, and I can&#8217;t really &#8220;feel&#8221; like with a quiche. So, I feel like I am totally winging it with whether or not it is done.  One time was much more firm than the other and neither looked as creamy as your pictures!<br />
Thanks for any insight,<br />

				<p>Made these with the thinner filling and Meyer lemons. Turned a lemon bar hater into someone who is still sad, a week later, that these wondrous bites of sunshine are gone. Thanks Deb!</p>
<p>Emily: I made these on Friday afternoon for a party on Saturday and found them to be much better on Saturday actually. The lemon really perks up after a day or two in an airtight container.</p>
