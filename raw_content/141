			<h1>How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries</h1>
			<p>
	<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; ">What Causes Lithium-ion to Age?</span></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lithium-ion battery works on ion movement between the positive and negative electrodes. In theory, such a mechanism should work forever, but shelf life, cycling and temperature affect the performance. Because batteries are used under many demanding environmental conditions, manufacturers take a conservative approach and specify a battery life between 300 and 500&nbsp;discharge/charge cycles. Life cycle testing is easy to measure and is well understood by the user. Some organizations also add a date stamp of three to five years; however, this method is less reliable because it does not include the type of use.</font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Figure 1 illustrates the capacity drop of 11 Li-polymer batteries that have been cycled at a Cadex laboratory. The 1500mAh pouch cells were first charged to 4.20V/cell at 1C rate (1500mA) and allowed to saturate to 0.05C (75mA) as part of full charge procedure. The batteries were then discharged at 1500mA to 3.0V/cell, and the cycle was repeated.</font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img alt="Capacity drop as part of cycling" src="http://batteryuniversity.com/_img/content/lith1(2).jpg" style="width: 410px; height: 297px; " /></font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Figure 1: Capacity drop as part of cycling. </strong>A pool of new 1500mA Li-ionbatteries for smart phone istested on a Cadex C7400 battery analyzer. All 11 pouch packs show a starting capacity of 88&ndash;94 percent and decrease in capacity to 73&ndash;84 percent after 250 full discharge cycles (2010).</font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Courtesy of Cadex</font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Designed for a smart phone, the packs were already a few months old at time of testing and none of the batteries made it to 100 percent. It is common to see lower than specified capacities and shelf life may have contributed to this. Manufacturers tend to overrate their batteries; they know that very few customers would complain. In our test, the expected capacity loss was uniform over the 250 cycles. All sample batteries performed as expected.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similar to a mechanical device that wears out faster with heavy use, so also does the depth of discharge (DoD) determine the cycle count. The smaller the depth of discharge, the longer the battery will last. If at all possible, avoid frequent full discharges and charge more often between uses. If full discharges cannot be avoided, try utilizing a larger battery. Partial discharge on Li-ion is fine; there is no memory and the battery does not need periodic full discharge cycles other than to calibrate the fuel gauge on a smart battery.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Table 2 compares the number of discharge/charge cycles a battery can deliver at various DoD levels before lithium-ion is worn out. We assume end of life when the battery capacity drops to 70 percent. This is an arbitrary threshold that is application based.</font></p>

<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifying battery life by the number of discharge cycles is not complete by itself; equally if not more important are temperature conditions and charging voltages. Lithium-ion suffers stress when exposed to heat and kept at a high charge voltage.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elevated temperature is anything that dwells above 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), and a high voltage is higher than 4.10V/cell. When estimating longevity, these conditions are difficult to assess because the battery state is in constant flux, and so is the temperature in which it operates. Exposing the battery to high temperature and being at full state-of-charge for an extended time can be more damaging than cycling. Manufacturers do not like to talk about these environmental conditions and release information only in confidence when so requested.</font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this essay we do not depend on the manufacturer&rsquo;s specifications alone but also listen to the comments of users. BatteryUniversity.com is an excellent sounding board to connect with the public and learn about reality. This approach might be unscientific, but it is genuine. When the critical mass speaks, the manufacturers listen. The voice of the multitude is in some ways stronger than laboratory tests performed in sheltered environments.</font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let&rsquo;s look at real-life situations and examine what stress a lithium-ion battery encounters. Most packs last three to five years, less if exposed to high heat and if kept at a full charge. Table 3 illustrates capacity loss as a function of temperature and state-of-charge. One can clearly see a performance drop of recoverable capacity caused by environmental conditions and not cycling. The worst condition is keeping a fully charged battery at elevated temperatures, which is the case when running a laptop on the power grid. Under these circumstances the battery will typically last for about two years, whether cycled or not. The pack does not die suddenly but will produce decreasing runtimes as part of aging.</font></p>

<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Table 3: Permanent capacity loss of lithium‑ion as a function of temperature and charge level.</strong> High charge levels and elevated temperatures hasten permanent capacity loss. Newer designs may show improved results.</font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Batteries are also exposed to elevated temperature when charging with wireless chargers. The energy transfer from a charging mat to the portable device is 70 to 80 percent and the remaining 20 to 30 percent is lost mostly in heat. Placing a cellular phone on the heat generating charging mat stresses the battery more than if charged on a designated charger. We keep in mind that the mat will cool down once the battery is fully charged. Read more: <a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_without_wires">Charging without wires</a>.</font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equally stressful is leaving a battery in a hot car, especially if exposed to the sun. When not in use, store the battery in a cool place. For long-term storage, manufacturers recommend a 40 percent charge. This allows for some self-discharge while still retaining sufficient charge to keep the protection circuit active. Finding the ideal state-of-charge is not easy; this would require a discharge unit with an appropriate cut-off. Users should not worry too much about the state-of-charge; a cool and dry place is more important.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The voltage level to which the cells are charged also plays a role in extending longevity. For safety reasons, most lithium-ion cannot exceed 4.20V/cell. While a higher voltage would boost capacity, over-voltage shortens service life. Figure 4 demonstrates the increased capacity but shorter cycle life if Li-ion were allowed to exceed the 4.20V/cell limit. At 4.35V, the capacity would increase by 10 to 15 percent, but the cycle count would be cut in half. More critical than the extra capacity is reduced safety, which would be the results of a higher charge voltage.</font></p>

<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chargers for cellular phones, laptops and digital cameras bring the Li-ion battery to 4.20V/cell. This allows maximum runtime, and the consumer wants nothing less than optimal use of the battery capacity. The industry, on the other hand, is more concerned with longevity and prefers lower voltage thresholds. Satellites and electric vehicles are examples where longevity is important.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have limited information by how much lower charge voltages prolong battery life; this depends on many conditions, as we have learned. What we do know, however, is the capacities. At a charge to 4.10V/cell, the battery holds a capacity that is about 10 percent less than going all the way to 4.20V/cell. In terms of optimal longevity, a charge voltage limit of 3.92V/cell works best but the capacity would be low. Besides selecting the best-suited voltage thresholds, it is also important that the battery does not stay in the high-voltage stage for a long time and is allowed to drop after full charge has been reached.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The voltage threshold of commercial chargers cannot be changed, and making it adjustable would have advantages, especially for laptops as a means of prolonging battery life. When running on extended AC mode, the user would select the &ldquo;long life&rdquo; mode and the battery would charge to only, say, 4.05V/cell. This would get a capacity of about 80 percent. Before traveling the user would apply the &ldquo;full charge mode&rdquo; to bring the charge to 4.20V/cell. This saturation charge would take about an hour and would fill the battery to 100 percent capacity.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Realizing the stress on the battery, some laptop and cellular phone manufacturers choose an end-of-charge voltage that is less than 4.20V/cell. A slightly larger pack compensates for the reduced runtime. Another option to extend battery life is removing the pack from the laptop when running on the power grid. The <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission</em>advises the public to do this out of concern for overheating and causing a fire. Removing the battery has the disadvantage of losing unsaved work on power failure.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Heat buildup is always a concern and running a laptop in bed or on a pillow may contribute to this by restricting airflow. Not only will heat stress electronic components, elevated temperature causes the electrodes in the battery to react with the electrolyte and this will permanently lower the capacity. Placing a ruler or other object under the laptop to increase floor clearance improves air circulation around the enclosure and keeps the unit cooler.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question is often asked: Should I disconnect my laptop from the power grid when not in use? Under normal circumstances this should not be necessary because once the lithium-ion battery is full, a correctly functioning charger will discontinue the charge and will only engage when the battery voltage drops to a low level. Most users do not remove the AC power, and I like to believe that this practice is safe.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Everyone wants to keep the battery as long as possible and use it in a way that is least stressful. This is not always feasible. Sometimes we need to run the battery in environments that are not conducive to optimal service life. As a doctor cannot predict how long a person will live based on diet and activity alone, so also does the life of a battery vary, and it can always be cut short by an unexpected failure. Batteries and humans share the same volatility.</font></p>
<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To get a better understanding of what causes irreversible capacity loss in Li-ion batteries, several research laboratories* are performing forensic tests. Scientist dissected failed batteries to find suspected problem areas on the electrodes. Examining an unrolled 1.5-meter-long strip (5 feet) of metal tape coated with oxide reveals that the finely structured nanomaterials have coarsened. Further studies revealed that the lithium ions responsible to shuttle electric charge between the electrodes had diminished on the cathode and had permanently settled on the anode. This results in the cathode having a lower lithium concentration than a new example, a phenomenon that is irreversible. Knowing the reason for such capacity loss might enable battery manufacturers to produce future batteries with longer life spans.</font></p>
<h2>
	Power loss through Protection Circuit</h2>
<p>
	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides common aging, a Li-ion battery can also fail because of undercharge. This occurs if a Li-ion pack is stored in a discharged condition. Self-discharge gradually lowers the voltage of the already discharged battery and the protection circuit cuts off between 2.20 and 2.90V/cell. Some chargers and battery analyzers (including those from Cadex) provide a wake-up feature, or &ldquo;boost,&rdquo; to re-energize and recharge these seemingly dead Li-ion batteries.</font></p>

&#8220;Charge rate is often denoted as C or C-rate and signifies a charge or discharge rate equal to the capacity of a battery in one hour. For a 1.6Ah battery, C = 1.6A. A charge rate of C/2 = 0.8A would need two hours ...&nbsp; to fully charge the battery from an empty state, if supported by the battery.

I am always on fixed power, the problem with removing the battery at 40% is that I would be vulnerable to power outages. With the battery still inside the laptop charged to 40% I would be saving my battery, saving power and saving my data in the event of a main-power failure. Does anyone know if there is a software out there which could charge to 40% and stop? If so, please let me know.</p></div>

<p>How are these recommendations compatible? It is really safe to *completely* discharge the battery? Wouldn&#8217;t it die after a single *full* discharge?</p></div>

<p>You do not want to leave your battery in your laptop even if would remain at 40% because your laptop generates quite a bit of heat from use which is harmful to the batteries. The lithium batteries should be stored at 40% AND in a cool place.</p></div>

What remaining life should I expect from a four-year old battery that has never been charged? Should I consider returning the drill?</p></div>

One comment - a couple of your graphs are the wrong way around - the convention is to have the independent variable on the x-axis. So, in the last graph, you should be reading off the number of cycles on the y-axis, against each charge/discharge rate on the x-axis. (The number of cycles is *dependent* on the charge/discharge rate).</p></div>

A power supply that can provide constant current is needed, for ex a lab power supply. The voltage should be set to the voltage written on the battery and the max current should be set to 5% of total capacity. Obviously the polarity has to be connected correctly and the charging process should be left alone for awhile until the constant current disappears.

Capacity of battery remained constant for more than 2 years now, what might be due to such &#8216;soft charging&#8217;, but also due to quality of Sony batteries.<br />
Dell Studio XPS has excellent utility which simply turned charging off whenever user wishes.<br />

This article is not telling you to avoid putting your battery in an oven (or &#8220;owen&#8221; as you so aptly put), but to instead avoid using the laptop while on the power grid with the battery fully charged.</p>

<p>For all you derps out there (most of you, judging by your comments), this means that you should not keep the battery in the laptop while it is plugged in and you are using it. Laptops generate heat (hurr durr) and since the battery is in the laptop (again, hurr durr), it is exposed to the heat, AND is kept constantly at full charge while plugged in. So, no, genesis, one doesn&#8217;t require an oven to expose your battery to heat (derp). Laptop internals regularly get to 60-70 degrees Celsius, well above the stated ideal temperature for batteries.</p>

<p>And I CAN&#8217;T believe one of you actually stored a laptop battery for SIX MONTHS to GAIN battery life. What a tard. Never using a battery will zap the power quickly.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another thing. I left a laptop mostly plugged in for a year. It had VERY few discharges. Yet the battery lasted for only a 1/2 hour or so. So you tards be the judge as to whether or not keeping it plugged in with the battery installed leads to excess wear.</p>

<p>As for actually using the battery (when not plugged in), just use it. Avoid full discharges and don&#8217;t keep it in a hot area.</p>

<p>And for all you idiots wanting to magically make your depleted batteries work again: you are, as I mentioned, idiots. Everything has a lifespan. If you&#8217;ve had your battery for a while and used it often, then guess what? It&#8217;s old and used and you have to buy another one! YAY! HURR DURR!</p>

<p>And some derp mentioned people complaining about laptop performance: WTF are you talking about? Someone said that laptops function slower without the battery while on power, but that&#8217;s the only complaint I heard. You&#8217;re just a retard.</p>

<p>And someone here actually doesn&#8217;t grasp the concept of a discharge. Are you serious? Look up the word. Good Lord. Mega tards.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks everybody for decreasing my hope in humanity even more than previously. The internet does that quite often. Bye, retards.</p></div>

<p>I have been a geek and modelled this. If you take an average battery with a life of 600hrs in standby (the actual number dont matter here), then the total hours you get for the 100%DoD is actually more than the 10%DoD. Yes, you get more recharges, but less total hours of use. From the table in the article, the 50% DoD gives you the most number of hours out of the battery before it cannot get above 70%.</p>

<p>Its quality not quantity!</p>

<p>p.s. I havent read all the comments so I apologise if I am repeating what has been said!</p></div>

<p>My question is that given that I would follow the 10% discharge cycle would that not cause the battery to &#8216;fail&#8217; sooner since discharging 10% and then charging to 100% 4,700 times would roughly equate to 470 100% discharges?

				<div class="commentBody"><p>It is close, but it does depend what they mean by 10% DoD</p>

<p>If you look at the graph (figure 1), it shows that each time you charge, the &#8216;full&#8217; level on the battery is a bit less each time. The failure is when it can only get to 70%. So lets say you charge 2000 times, the batt may only charge to 80%, say. Then 10% DoD in this case will be (in your example) 10% of 80mAh. If they meant 10%DoD of the orginal batt capacity in each charge, then you are right but I doubt it. I say that because if that is what they meant, then they could not have done a 100% DoD case (how can you discharge 100mAh when the batt is only at 80mAh?)</p>

<p>So in your cals, where you have (100*0.10)*4,700  the 100 needs to be a decreasing value for each charge e.g. (100*0.1) + (99.9*0.1) + (99.5*0.1) or similar</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

I have seen proof time and time again that Li-Ion DOES benefit greatly from &#8220;conditioning&#8221; the battery by letting it discharge fully (until the device shuts itself down) and charging it 8-12 hours (repeat process) for the first 3-5 days.<br />
That could solve your problem, or you might just be getting old batteries.<br />
Next time you receive a new battery, try this method, I think you will be surprised.</p></div>

That could also be just down to the fact that this sort of cycling is used to calibrate the battery mater in some equipment - Apple Macs spring to mind here. So repeating this until your battery is in peak form (usually 3 or 4 cycles) will keep updating the calibration values and hence give you the most accurate reading. This in turn will give the longest time before the software of the device thinks the battery is nearly flat and shuts down to protect your information.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for the thread. It&#8217;s amazing the amount of FUD that there is out there, not helped by the fact that most manufacturers are particularly vague with regards to their battery care and handling instructions. They could all do with having an article similar to this, but specific to their particular battery, charger circuit and typical usage patterns, in their manual.</p></div>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>Paul, I read the article and am saying that my 20+ years of experience with rechargeable batteries disagrees with one primary implication:&nbsp; The article implies that many partial cycles will allow the battery to keep full capacity longer.&nbsp; The &#8220;memory&#8221; effect that plagued NiCad chemistry and supposedly is not present in Li-Ion, is the effect that, if the battery is only partially discharged, then recharged, it will soon only have the capacity to which it is used, i.e., if you only discharge it 10% and then recharge it each time, after a number of cycles, the total mAH available will only be about 10% of its original capacity.&nbsp; My experience has found this true of NiCad, NiMH, and Li-Ion, although Li-Ion is the most forgiving.&nbsp; As I stated before, a faulty charger connection caused very small cycles on my last Li-Ion and it destroyed the capacity in days.&nbsp; I would certainly not recommend discharging any of these chemistries small amounts between recharges.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen this habit destroy capacity very prematurely numerous times.<br />
Most of today&#8217;s notebook computers have a hysteresis built into the charge cycle such that, if you fully charge it, no charging will occur until you have intentionally discharged it to some extent.&nbsp; This allows you to keep it plugged in for periods of time without excessive short charge cycles.&nbsp; Some also have the option to turn the charger off until it is really necessary at a low remaining charge.&nbsp; This is a clue that notebook computer manufacturers agree with me on this aspect.</p></div>

<p>Charging the battery while the computer is running may cause the battery serious stress because of heat. But I occasionally charge my netbook around 7pm when the temperature is cool so I can watch the netbook when its reached 80%.</p>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>Re. Charging / Discharging of Lithium Batteries - and useful life of the battery<br />
The Article and many of the Comments, as well as stressing prevention of overheating, (in a hot computer or a hot car) seem to indicate that length of battery life is a matter of how much you discharge the battery, and how often you charge it. So it can take 500 cycles of total discharge (100% discharged to 0%) or 4700 cycles of 10% discharge (100% charged dischragd to 90%). [see exchange between David &amp; Paul on April 07, 2011] They agree that the amount of work done by the Li-battery is pretty much the same whatever approach you take.</p>

<p>Many of the comments focus on avoiding overcharging - and some recommend keeping the Li-battery around 40% - 50%&nbsp; discharged, and topping it up frequently. Sounds like &#8220;ïf you don&#8217;t use it, you lose it&#8221;</p>

<p>So far so good. But I have a confusion which is (unless I overlooked something - want to avoid a &#8216;flame&#8217; from &#8216;derp&#8217;). I am concerned about undercharging a Li-Battery. This concern relates to a Lenovo Thinkpad system, but I imagine it could apply to many other Laptops.</p>

<p>I have a ThinkPad W520, and since the mains adapter is a brick 17cm x 8cm x 3.5cm weighing 750g (6.7"x 3.2&#8221; x  1.3&#8221; weighing 1.64 lbs) I figured from suggestions on thinkpads.com Support Community (http://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?p=628326) that I can equally use a smaller mains Adapter also <br />
available from Lenovo. </p>

<p>The &#8220;Brick&#8221; has an output of 170W, 20V charging at 8.5A<br />
The smaller versions have an output 90W and charge at 4.5A <br />
so accordingly I bought a Lenovo 41R4494 Ultraslim Adapter which is 11.5 cm x 7cm x 1.7cm and weighs 377g (4.5&#8221; x 2.75&#8221;&nbsp; x 0.67&#8221; weighing under 12 ounces). I felt very pleased.</p>

<p>But now my ThinkPad is nagging me each time I switch on or close down:<br />
&#8220;Ïncorrect AC adapter is attached. <br />
This AC adapter may not provide enough power to your Thinkpad. Please reconnect the proper AC adapter.&#8221; <br />
i.e they mean I am ündercharging the battery, right?<br />
(That&#8217;s true, if I leave the UltraSlim attached while I work, the battery runs down. <br />
 Question: But is that bad? Maybe it runs down more slowly, than if the UktraSlim Adapter is *not* attached? Can it damage the control circuits in the battery or the mains adapter?</p>

<p>My compromise work routine uses the Li-battery for my working day, and I charge it overnight.<br />
1. I hibernate the computer - with remaining charge in the battery ca. 30% - leaving it plugged in to the UltraSlim charger overnight. <br />
2. In the morning I unplug the mains adapter, before waking up the computer (thereby avoiding the nag).<br />
&nbsp;  It&#8217;s back to 98% - 100% - showing 8 or 9 hours work available in the battery (the 9-cell)<br />
During the day, I use the computer on battery, in sporadic intervals of half to 1½ hours. Between each work interval I close the lid to hibernate. I rarely finish the day with less than 30% charge in the battery.</p>

<p>So now to my main questions:</p>

<p>A. is this routine harmful for the life of a Li-Battery?<br />
B. if not, why does Lenovo nag me for using the 4.5A mains adapter? <br />
&nbsp;  (it charges OK when I am not using the computer).<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Many thanks for any insight or  &#8216;light&#8217; the Team can shed on this subject.</p>

<p>Regards = John</p>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>I find this article very interesting. With the aim of trying to put it in practice by moving to a more sound &#8220;maintenance&#8221; of my Li-ion batteries, I was quickly listing them in my mind: I ve Li-Ion batteries on my notebooks (Asus and MacBook Air), my two photo-camera, my videocamera, my mobile phone.</p>

<p>So, two main insight I want to apply: 1) never leave a li-ion battery inactive for too long time (i.e. months), but keep electrons move from time to time; 2) store the battery at the best possible conditions, i.e.: low temperature, low humidity, about 40% of charge.</p>

<p>I should have no problems with mobile phones and notebooks, as I use them everyday so keeping them at about the charge level I want is something I can someway control (plug/unplug them appropriately). The only problem is the Mac which heats often and there&#8217;s no way to remove the battery if I want to give it some relief.</p>

<p>The real problems are with the photo/video camera: I don&#8217;t use them everyday, sometimes I don&#8217;t use them for a few months. How can I simultaneously apply both insights ?<br />
Suppose I charge them to some 40% (difficult to control, at least with the photo-cameras, while the Sony Videocam has a progress bar), and then I remove from the devices and leave them apart. I then go to re-charge them after 1 month (insight 1). How much charge can they loose in 1-month ? I imagine few enough so that to bring them back to 40% I should leave them plugged in 10 minutes ? </p>

<p>Is this something sound and workable ? </p>

<p>Because if not, then I should charge them more and then artificially use the devices intensely to make them discharge the battery again at about 40%. That&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any universal charger/discharger that I can use to control how much charge/discharge I want to apply to a li-ion battery before I store them.</p>

<p>All this is so much easier with the Ni-MH Hybrid batteries (used in strobes for example) for which I&#8217;ve bought a Maha Powerex MH-C9400 charger/discharger and every few weeks I run a Refresh&Analyze; cycle specifically designed for optimal storage of the batteries (then, every few months I run another &#8220;stronger&#8221; program to fully re-generate them).</p>

Given what the article says, would it not be best to cycle charge between 10%-60% for example ? (avoid full charge to not have high voltage in the battery) ?</p>

<p>And what I would like to know is what is best (ex. during working hours, at my desk) ??&nbsp; :<br />
- let the laptop/phone plugged, so with battery near 100%, but almost not used (except for peak power use, such as in phones for some radio communications).<br />
- Or only plug sometimes, maintaining charge beetween 20%-80%. In this case we have lower voltage, but the battery is much more in use, enduring more (partial) cycles.</p>

<p>Note that for phone, they won&#8217;t work with battery pulled-off. I wish it could be set up to only charge to a partial charge (ex 75%).</p></div>

As far as my logic goes then at least in 2011, it&#8217;s ok to keep your laptop plugged in with the battery attached, because<br />
1. if you charge to 100% and keep to AC on the charger is intelligent enough not to really start charging the battery again until it naturally drops to about 95%<br />
2. while on AC the laptop does not draw power from the battery (source Dell homepage)<br />
You have to keep in mind though to discharge it / charge it once in a while (from this page here it seems the best is to let it go to about 25%?).<br />
Only if your laptop gets very hot while using it on AC, is removing the battery a good idea as a hot laptop will also naturally heat up the battery (remove the battery and touch it, should give you an idea). This, as I understand, will make the battery loose it&#8217;s capacity more quickly.</p></div>

<p>If you intend to use your laptop charged in for an extended period of time, remove the battery from it at 40% capacity.</p>

<p>You should not keep the battery on the laptop. The laptop will keep charging the battery as soon as it losses a little capacity and will eventually reduce the battery life expectancy.</p></div>

50% * 1500 cycles = 750 times full capacity<br />
25% * 2500 cycles = 625 times full capacity<br />
10% * 4700 cycles = 470 times full capacity</p>

&#8220;Maybe I am the only one missing one aspect of the number of cycles verses depth of discharge: if you only get 500 cycles with 100% discharge, as compared to 4700 cycles with 10% discharge, those cycles are not equivalent.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is, the 100% discharge got 10 times the power ouput as compared to the 10% depth. If assuming useful work was done in each depth, then in fact getting 500 cycles actually gets a bit more work than 4700 cycles of only 10% the depth.&#8221;<br />
——————————————————————————————————————<br />
You are correct in your observation, but you should have taken it one step farther. Using the data of Table 2 which gives the number of cycles to 70% capacity as a function of depth of discharge, one can derive the relative amount of total energy extracted (a dimensionless quantity) from a Li-ion cell as a function of DoD:</p>

<p>100% DoD yields 500 units of energy from a Li-ion cell over its useful life;<br />
50% DoD provides 750 units;<br />
25% DoD provides 625 units; and<br />
10% DoD provides 470 units.</p>

<p>The data in Table 2 indicate that recharging when the capacity reaches 50% is optimal  over the other three options.</p>

When you set up software on your computer, some important records are stored inside your computer&#8217;s registry.&nbsp; However, when you eliminate or unset up software, sometimes those data remain inside your registry.&nbsp;  Maybe the software was poorly written or your computer had a hard time unset uping the software properly.&nbsp; In either case, the end-result is that you have information in your registry that are no longer needed.&nbsp;   <br />

If we have a charger ready and need to know when to charge to prolong life, you can&#8217;t read it from the table directly. If I fully use the battery until it&#8217;s empty (100% DoD) you have to compare that to 10 cycles discharging to 10% DoD, because that&#8217;s fulfilling the same usage; any other comparison is useless. So looking at these four values, the 25% DoD seems to be the best, but more values would be helpful.</p></div>

				<div class="commentBody"><p>I work research and development and have tested lithium-ion cells for years. Here are some points I have learned on lithium ion: </p>

<p>0. If a battery is in a device, the device always has some sort of battery management system. Full discharge (to 0 volts) should not be possible and does cause irreparable damage. &#8220;full discharge&#8221; to about 2.7V (0% state of charge) is normal.<br />
1. Storage will not rejuvenate or recover capacity. <br />
2. If you need to store long term, store it at  50% charge. This reduces self discharge and/or active material degradation.&nbsp;  <br />
3. Freezing can damage a cell by causing dendrites (crystalization) in the electrolyte components and piercing seperator or damaging material bonds.<br />
4. The lower the operating temperature - the slower the ion exchange.<br />
The higher the temperature - the higher the material degradation. Room temp is best.<br />
6. Once in a while, discharge the battery until the device cuts it off, fully charge it and leave it on the charger for a short time. This moves as many ions as possible from one electrode to the other keeping them free to move instead of &#8220;stubbornly stuck&#8221;.<br />
7. Remember different companies make different formulations of Lithium ion and Li-polymer that behave differently like High power, High capacity, long life ... there is always a trade off.</p></div>

<p>You want to run the laptop without the battery if you can. Don&#8217;t leave the battery in the laptop when you are connected on the 120 Vca. A poor battery charger will reduce your battery life with an bad charging method.</p>

<p>As it was said earlier, the optimal charge level is around 50% of the battery capacity. You don&#8217;t want to go crazy with your laptop&#8217;s charge level. I suggest you to use the laptop between 40-100% of your battery capacity and then recharge it.</p></div>

<p>Simple. Unambiguous. The equipment would then be left plugged to a mains supply as much as possible. It would automatically apply optimum charging. If it detects excessively long absence from a mains supply, it warns the user.</p>
