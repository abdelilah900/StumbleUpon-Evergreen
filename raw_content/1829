The perfect season went straight out the window.</p><p>The Packers were able to get past the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bears, Atlanta Falcons, New Orleans Saints and the New York Giants, but they just couldn't get past the Chiefs.</p><p>Not to mention, the team was playing with a new quarterback in Kyle Orton and a new head coach in Romeo Crennel.</p>

						<p>Going into his 1990 fight against Mike Tyson, Buster Douglas was a 42-to-1 shot to win the match, but all it took was a single shot from his first to knock out the big mean man.</p><p>Tyson was by far one of the most feared boxers around, but Douglas was not afraid of the man that actually bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear back in 1997.</p><p>Douglas took out Tyson, and then he took his heavyweight title.</p>

						<p>The New England Patriots were looking to complete their perfect season, but it was the New York Giants who would play party pooper at the 2007 Super Bowl.</p><p>This game of course had one of the most iconic catches in sports history, as David Tyree caught a pass by pressing the ball against his helmet. This catch would lead the Giants onto their game-winning drive, where they took the game with a 17-14 lead.</p><p>There was no doubt that many had pretty much labeled the Patriots as winners before the game even started (12-point favorites), as this team was proven under coach Bill Belichick with quarterback Tom Brady. The Giants, on the other hand, were nobodies, but they became somebodies with this win.</p><p>There is nothing more upsetting than losing a shot at perfection.</p>

						<p>Of all the research I did, and from what I had set in my mind before going into this list, the United States hockey team defeating the Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics topped every list.</p><p>The Soviets were the favorites heading into this game, as they were a team full of tradition and experience. The Americans, on the other hand, were made up of a bunch of random players, most of whom were college players or nobodies.</p><p>Still, somehow, they were able to take Lake Placid by storm and take down the mighty Soviets in what will go down as the greatest sports upset of all time.</p>
