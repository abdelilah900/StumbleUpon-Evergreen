<div class="entry">
<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/04/brownie-roll-out-cookies/" title="brownie roll-out cookies"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3140/2451054974_f98f46afcc.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="brownie roll-out cookies" /></a></p>
Two weeks ago, Alex and I took advantage of the then-awesome weather and went out for dinner at a place with outdoor seating. One cocktail led to another and then Alex put his hand on my knee! No, just kidding. He actually suggested that we order dessert, and in particular, the homemade ice cream sandwiches on the menu. Who was I to argue?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2450978982/" title="feeding my cookie cutter addiction"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2227/2450978982_f88d0ec97d_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="feeding my cookie cutter addiction" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2450985460/" title="chocolate, pronounced"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2375/2450985460_a07eaee2fc_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="chocolate, pronounced" /></a></p>
<p>The two tiniest, most precious ice cream sandwiches arrived a few minutes later and, you know, the ice cream, it was pretty good. But the sandwich? The two chocolate cookies? Forgive me for using this over-tired metaphor, but they were an almost Proustian experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2451006438/" title="cookie footprints"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/2451006438_311f58c931.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="cookie footprints" /></a></p>
<p>You see, we made chocolate cookies exactly like that for Hanukah each year growing up. Why for Hanukah? Honestly, I have no idea. It might be that the only cookie cutters I remember were our Hanukah ones (a dreydel, menorah and Jewish star, the nuisance-y stamp type that it was impossible to get the dough out of) or that it was the only time my mother found the nuisance of rolling out dough worth it, but man, did I love those cookies, and I had to make them again, immediately.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2451019086/" title="unbaked brownie roll-out cookies"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3094/2451019086_882818aff5.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="unbaked brownie roll-out cookies" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-493"></span></p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking: chocolate roll-out cookies? How dull! But, well, I&#8217;m sorry&#8211;you&#8217;re wrong. What&#8217;s notable about these cookies is not what they are&#8211;which is, if you must know, intensely awesome&#8211;but what they&#8217;re not. There&#8217;s no sea salt in them, no melted 70 percent chocolate. There&#8217;s no brown butter or vanilla bean pulp or pinch of espresso powder. There is not a single thing in them we&#8217;d probably jazz them up with today, and instead of fighting this simplicity, I encourage you to revel in it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2450238971/" title="brownie roll-out cookies"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2028/2450238971_68d056581b.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="brownie roll-out cookies" /></a></p>
<p>They will not disappoint. The slight amount of baking powder gives them a softness not usually found in roll-out cookies, which are typically sandier and snappish. These are tender, like a pressed brownie and they particularly excel at a quarter-inch height, slightly thicker than a standard cookie cutter cookie. The cocoa is not an afterthought (like recipes that suggest you swap a couple tablespoons of flour for cocoa to make an chocolate cookie) but has a significant presence that blooms in the oven, leaving you with something that people won&#8217;t believe doesn&#8217;t have a single bit of melted chocolate in it.</p>
<p>I should also tell you that because of their shatter-free bite, they also make excellent lids and bases for ice cream sandwiches. But I won&#8217;t, because that would be dangeous. Okay?</p>

<p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/04/chicken-revisited-and-enlightened/">Chicken Empanadas with Chorizo and Olives</a>
<p><b>Brownie Roll-Out Cookies*</b><br />
Recipe from Deb&#8217;s mom</p>
<p>3 cups all-purpose flour<br />
1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br />
1 cup lightly salted butter, softened (Deb note: I don&#8217;t really see &#8220;lightly salted&#8221; much these days, so I used one stick salted, one stick unsalted)<br />
1 1/2 cups sugar<br />
2 large eggs<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa (I used the &#8220;good&#8221; stuff&#8211;Droste or Galler&#8211;but I can assure you that my mother only used Hershey&#8217;s growing up, so your choice)</p>
<p>Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Whisk dry flour, salt and baking powder in bowl and set aside. Mix butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla and cocoa in mixer. Gradually add flour mixture, and mix until smooth. Wrap in plastic and chill for at least one hour.</p>
<p>Roll out cookie dough on floured counter. Cut into desired shapes, brushing extra deposits of flour off the top. (It does disappear once baked, though, so don&#8217;t overly fret if they go into the oven looking white.) Bake on a parchment-lined baking sheet for 8 to 11 minutes (the former for 1/8-inch thick cookies, the latter for 1/4-inch cookies) until the edges are firm and the centers are slightly soft and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2450205775/in/photostream/">puffed</a>.</p>
<p>Transfer to a wire rack to cool.</p>
<p>* According to my mother&#8217;s recipe, they&#8217;re called chocolate sugar cookies but I do not feel that it does them justice.</p>

				<p>These look outstanding! I&#8217;ve never heard of this type of thing but it&#8217;s a genius idea, and I love the idea of putting ice cream between! They look almost like soft gingerbread cookies.</p>

				<p>Yum!  I ce cream Sandwich&#8217;s are my favorite!  Yum Yum Yum.  I notice that one year ago was the empanadas!  Yes the very ones that were stolen from me by Amy&#8217;s Cool Women Who Rock (uh, suck) club.  I have never forgotten them.  Guess that is what I get for getting drunk on Cinco de Mayo and leaving them in Amy&#8217;s freezer.  Grrrrr.  Maybe I will try to make them myself&#8230;.. HA HA HA AH AH AHAHAHAHA AH AHAHAHAH</p>

				<p>mmmm&#8230; my husband was just telling me yesterday that his favorite dessert as a kid was ice cream sandwiches- these look like just the perfect cookie!<br />
i&#8217;m always disappointed when sandwiching icecream with regular cookies- they are always unpleasant to bite- and these &#8221; brownie roll-outs &#8221; are just genius! lets see, my husbands out watching a game- i may just surprise him with these now!</p>

				<p>Ooh, my husband would love ice cream sandwiches with these!  Of course, he would love ice cream in any form, but that&#8217;s a minor detail.  I suppose I need to procure a rolling pin&#8230;</p>

				<p>Hi Deb!<br />
do you think I can use non-Dutch processed cocoa with this? That&#8217;s all I have at the moment. I&#8217;m thinking the baking powder might not work in this case &#8211; could I use baking soda? How important is the leavening agent?<br />
thank you!</p>

				<p>I noted in the recipe that although I used Dutch cocoa, I can assure you that growing up, my mother only used Hershey&#8217;s&#8211;i.e. you can use either. Personally, I think Dutched cocoas have a richer taste, which is why they are my preference.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Roll out cookie dough on floured counter until. &#8221; &#8211; until what?  Also, will these freeze for storage? Thanks so much for your blog &#8211; I absolutely love your photos and your recipes!</p>

				<p>Wow. I cannot wait to make these. My roommates are going to go nuts.</p>
<p>Also, now I want to make those empanadas again. I made them for a vaguely Mexican themed party about a month ago and at one point my friend Tom came over to me with two in his hands and one in his mouth and asked me why I didn&#8217;t tell him they were so delicious. Thanks for the inspiration, Deb!</p>

				<p>The error is fixed now. </p>
<p>If you wish to freeze them, I always think it&#8217;s best to do so before they are baked. I only baked about a third of my batch. The rest I rolled out, cut into shapes, flash-froze so they would not stick together and then layered them between pieces of wax paper (to be extra cautious) in a freezer bag. Can&#8217;t wait to bake them off in the coming months!</p>

				<p>you have never steered me wrong in cookie land before (I found my favorite cookie thanks to you, and chocolate chip cookies that finally pleased my husband texture wise) so I suppose I must make these. </p>
<p>Plus now I might have an excuse to buy the ice cream maker I have wanted for 2 1/2 years now.</p>

				<p>These are getting made this week!  Wow! they look devine and the idea of making ice cream sandwhiches&#8230;.  Gotta try it!</p>
<p>yesterday I made english muffins from your <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/01/four-breakfasts/" rel="nofollow">pancakes, english muffins, frisee salad</a> post. They&#8217;re tricky because the dough is so sticky.  The first four were badly burnt.  They set off the smoke alarms.  So I lowered the temp on the griddle to about pancake heat and halved the dough for the next batch.  When they were browned nicely on both sides I thought they were still uncooked in the middle, but&#8230; I was wrong.  Split with a fork and toasted, they were heavenly.</p>

				<p>I am so making these on Thursday &#8211; France labour&#8217;s day! I&#8217;ve been quite anxious about not having the time to go grocery shopping for some leisure baking, but since I have everything at home, you&#8217;ll certainly find my on Thursday pm, still wearing pajamas, in my kitchen, rolling and cutting these!</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />

				<p>Just lightly brush them. The concern is if there is too much flour, the cookies will not have that lovely dark chocolate color. A little bit is fine, though.</p>

right now I love you and I hate you.<br />
I love you because I am about to get up from my computer, walk into my kitchen and make these cookies that i have been DROOLING over ever since your dear daughter posted pictures on flickr.<br />
I hate you because I am about to get up from my computer, walk into my kitchen and make these cookies that i have been DROOLING over ever since your dear daughter posted pictures on flickr. And then I am going to then sit down on the couch and eat 15 of them in one sitting. And that&#8217;s not good because swimsuit season is around the corner.<br />
Thank you do much for making my day and ruining my summer plans.<br />
With mixed feelings,<br />

				<p>A propos cookie cutters &#8211; beware of the william sonoma ones. I just got mine, gave them a good rinse before use&#8230; and&#8230; they went all rusty on me. which was very sad, because I&#8217;ve been itching to make pretty-shaped cookies for over a month now. I&#8217;m going to try the Sur La Table ones &#8211; they&#8217;ve been so good to me lately. And yes, these look incredible particularly because they are that simple.

				<p>These look really amazing. I remember going to my aunt&#8217;s friend&#8217;s house with her for a dinner/birthday party when I was younger and having homemade ice cream sandwiches for the first time. It had never even occured to me that you could make them at home. These look like they&#8217;d be delicious even without the ice cream (though I can see them being delicious with vanilla/coffee/cinnamon/butter pecan&#8230;)</p>

				<p>So.. stupid question&#8230; but&#8230;</p>
<p>Deb, you said you flash froze them before layering them between wax paper and putting them in for the long haul &#8211; How do you flash freeze?</p>
<p>THANKS!!</p>

				<p>I flash freeze items until they&#8217;re hard, so they won&#8217;t stick to their neighbors. Cookies tend to be quick&#8211;20-30 minutes usually do.</p>

				<p>Hi:</p>
<p>Hope you didn&#8217;t already answer this and I just missed it.  Can I use natural cocoa powder or must it be Dutch processed?  I prefer to use Scharffen Berger&#8217;s natural cocoa powder, but am hesitant to do so since you mentioned Droste and the recipe has baking powder&#8230;.</p>
<p>Thanks, Laura</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve answered it twice, but I don&#8217;t expect that everyone should read 61 comments before leaving one! &#8230;Yes, you can use either. I prefer Dutched, but can assure you that my mother, who&#8217;s recipe this is, had never used anything but Hershey&#8217;s brand and they were delicious enough to make this impression.</p>

				<p>Hey!</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been reading for awhile, and this is the second chocolate cookies recipe of yours I&#8217;ve tried &#8211; I made the Oreoes a few weeks back and they were a big hit. My dough for these is chilling now, but it seems a bit on the dry side, not as sticky as I&#8217;m used to for cookies&#8230;but I&#8217;m not a super-experiences baker. Is that normal?</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m so sad. I tried making these last night, and they never came together&#8230;literally. They remained a loose, almost sandy texture. I ended up just having to make little balls, and then smooshing them into flat rounds when they were still hot. </p>
<p>Any ideas for why them came out so dry? The flavor was still great though! Not that I had one (or 4) for breakfast :)</p>

				<p>Been a lurker for months now&#8230;I use your recipes a lot.  Thanks for all your helpful information and great recipes.</p>
<p>Last night I made these and they turned out very crunchy.  I put the ice cream between them, froze them, and they were still crunchy&#8230;but they were still great tasting, just a bit messy to eat!  Keep up the fantastic work!</p>

				<p>Maybe the altitude (I live in Colorado)? Should I have tried to add some liquid (milk?) Another egg? I&#8217;d love to make these again, but they were impossible to roll out. But like I said, so good.</p>
<p>Any ideas for what I may have done wrong? Or what I can do to remedy it? It all went bad when I was adding the flour mixture :(</p>

				<p>Hm, I wonder. I have no experience with high-altitude baking, so maybe someone else can chime it but if it was just a rolling out issue, well, rolling out hard, cold doughs can always be difficult and can crack and crumble if done too roughly or quickly. (Remind me to do a tutorial on this soon!)</p>

				<p>Brandy, the same thing happened with my dough.  When I mixed it up, it was not as sticky as I thought it should be for a dough that needed to be frozen, and it turned into sandy lumps in the fridge.  I also smooshed it into balls and baked it anyway.  The cookies tasted fine but were pretty ugly.</p>
<p>And I live in Michigan, so it&#8217;s definitely not the altitude (for me, at least).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering if I added too much flour?  I&#8217;ve stopped spooning my flour into my measuring cup for things like cookies because it seemed unnecessary (I just scoop); maybe I should start again?  Or start weighing the dry ingredients?</p>

				<p>I want to make a batch of decorated cookies and send them to a friend, but i would love to go non-traditional with these chocolate cookies (versus plain sugar). Can these brownie cookies be decorated in the same way that roll-out sugar cookies are&#8230; with royal icing and the works?? my concern is that they might be too soft or that the flavor with royal icing might be odd&#8230;</p>

				<p>Yeah, my dough looked NOTHING like that! It didn&#8217;t stick to the mixer paddle at all. Maybe next time I&#8217;ll just add the flour super slow until it&#8217;s the right consistency? Or should I add a liquid? Egg?</p>

				<p>Thank you for this!  The timing was perfect for me&#8211;all day, I was telling co-workers that I was craving &#8220;something like a cookie or a cake.  Not a brownie, but something in-between&#8230;&#8221;  I couldn&#8217;t articulate what it was, and then you posted the recipe!  I made them the next day and was completely satisfied with just one or two.</p>
<p>I will bake the rest of the dough tonight, and am planning to fill them with a cream cheese frosting.</p>

				<p>Hi there,<br />
I&#8217;m just trying to figure out how much a &#8216;stick&#8217; of butter weighs. Measuring butter into cups is way too many steps for me &#8211; I&#8217;m much better at just slicing a section off the block. But I&#8217;ve got a feeling that an American &#8216;stick&#8217; is somewhat smaller than an Australian one.<br />
Little help?<br />

				<p>Maybe I missed something, but the recipe does not indicate whether the butter should be cold, room-temp, or melted.  Could this be part of the dough-consistency problem?  I can only assume that it should be melted and cooled, in order to be able to mix the dry cocoa powder into it.  Why is the cocoa not mixed with all the other dry ingredients? There must be a reason for this.  Thanks for answering.</p>

				<p>The butter should be soft&#8211;I will edit that now.</p>
<p>I considered updating the recipe to whisk the cocoa with the other dry ingredients, but as I said, this is my mom&#8217;s recipe, we&#8217;ve always made it this way and it&#8217;s always worked this way, so I wanted to keep it authentic.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve just finished baking a batch of these moments ago. My dough looked exactly as your refrence picture in the comments above, and I had no problems at all (maybe those who found theirs to be too dry were using smaller eggs? I did use particually large ones..). I ended up rolling out my cookies between plastic wrap, which worked very well for me. And because I&#8217;m using an Aga (which aways runs a little hot, even using the cooling plate) decreased the baking time by 2 mins and turned them around after the first 3. Mine didn&#8217;t rise as much as yours (hardly at all, actually) but turned out with a lovely texture.</p>
<p>.. Now to try to pursuade my brother to drive us to the 24hr supermarket for icecream.. it may be gone midnight, but I&#8217;m dying to try these babies out with a scoop of vanilla. Thank you!!! I&#8217;ll be using this one again!</p>

				<p>Deb, do you know how much your flour usually weighs per cup when you scoop? I&#8217;ve been using a scale for baking these past few months, assuming 4.25 oz./cup, but get almost 5 oz. when I scoop into the cup. The dough is currently chilling and seems fine, I was just curious!</p>

				<p>After reading different posts that used several recipes from your site I just had to come and see it for myself. I can now see the reason(s) you became such an inspiration to many food bloggers :).<br />
Your cookies just made it to my must-do list. That last photo: simply stunning!</p>

				<p>Deb, I made these cookies yesterday and paired them up with some mint chip ice cream today.  Just by themselves they&#8217;re <em>amazing</em>, with the ice cream?  <em>Heavenly</em>!<br />
I used Dagoba Cacao. Didn&#8217;t have anything but unsalted butter so I added a smidgen more salt to the recipe and everything turned out just fine.  I also don&#8217;t have an electric mixer.  Everything was mixed by hand with excellent results.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always looking forward to your posts!</p>

				<p>I made these last weekend and they were an unmitigated success. Everyone loved them &#8211; my family, my co-workers. They were so easy. The only change I made to the recipe was to about a tablespoon or so of milk as I was mixing the batter because as the flour went in, the batter got really dry. That did the trick. I&#8217;d love to try making these with a ganache icing. Thanks for the recipe! Oh I was also amazed by how many cookies this batter made &#8211; I kept re-rolling the scraps and ended up with at least 5 dozen.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve never liked cheap ice cream sandwiches.  But the concept of ice cream sandwiches is just so good, and this is exactly what I&#8217;ve been imagining to be the perfect ice cream sandwich cookie. I just didn&#8217;t know a recipe existed for it&#8230;thanks!!!</p>

I had to try one of the cookies and they are the most amazing texture.  And they&#8217;re so EASY!  Thanks again for another great recipe.  I love this site!</p>

				<p>Hey deb, thanks for this recipe.  Great flavour but I totally overbaked my first batch.  My niece still loved helping me cut them out and eating them too &#8211; she didn&#8217;t have a sandwich but immediately worked out that they were good for dipping in icecream!  Very astute kid!  Anyway plan to make and freeze more, great to have this as a ready to go dessert.  Looking forward to your next post as always.</p>

				<p>Hi all.  I have only been lurking on your blog for about three days but I was recently compelled to post.  Today I was sitting by the boy friend while reading your blog and he got curious (for once, lol) and looked over my shoulder.  You know how you imagine cave men grunting for food?  Well, he saw these cookies and grunted his appreciation.  lol  So now I HAVE to make them but there are only two of us here and I don&#8217;t have ANY cookie cutter.  lol  That is what you get for being young and in college.  : )  Any suggestions?  My butter is already out of the fridge and I have a limited amount of time before he calls me from work demanding I bring them for his lunch!  lol</p>
<p>Thanks all.  You all seem great and have given me a number of laughs over the past few days.  : )</p>

				<p>Deb two quick questions:</p>
<p>1. When you say to &#8220;Mix butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla and cocoa in mixer&#8221; is it as simple as it sounds &#8211; throw it all in there and let it rip?</p>
<p>2. How thick would you say the dough should be rolled out to?</p>

				<p>Hi Sky &#8212; 1. Yes. I know, it sounded odd to me too; like most bakers I am used to mixing my dry ingredients, beating my wet ones and being delicate when combining the two. But this worked. I considered rewriting the recipe so it fit the standard recipe-writing patterns, but like I said, it worked, it&#8217;s from mom, I didn&#8217;t mess with it. :)</p>
<p>2. 1/8-inch thick is fairly standard, and that&#8217;s the way we made them when I was a kid. But 1/4-inch? Oh my. They get really brownie-like, and so tender in the middle. So, it depends on what you&#8217;re going for.</p>

				<p>Deb, two questions:</p>
<p>1) I&#8217;m trying to decide between two of your chocolate cookie recipes for ice cream sandwiches (where sandwich = chocolate cookies + peanut butter ice cream).  Which would you recommend? This one?  Or the one from your previous post about ice cream sandwich cookies?</p>
<p>2) When making ice cream sandwiches, do you  scoop the ice cream in between two cookies and eat it right away?  Or do you re-freeze the whole sandwich in some plastic wrap?  I don&#8217;t want my cookies to get soggy, but one of my favorite memories of my youth is biting into that ever-yielding cookie of a chipwich, where the whole thing stays mostly together until it&#8217;s all melty down your arm at the end.  Thoughts?</p>

				<p>Hi Lizzi &#8212; I actually think I&#8217;d use this one. I think there&#8217;s something slightly softer about it when it is cold. I also recommend refreezing the cookies after you scoop it&#8211;something we didn&#8217;t do that first time around almost two years (!) ago. It was messy and they melted too fast.</p>

				<p>Made these last night using Green and Black&#8217;s Organic cocoa (Green and Blacks is UK based and aaammaaazing. Their 85% chocolate is like a fine wine..one or two squares is all it takes to satisfy!!). The cookies are fabulous!! I&#8217;ve frozen half the dough to use later, as the recipie (as you said) makes &#8216;alot&#8217; of cookies. Love them, and so easy! Thanks for this!</p>

				<p>Hi, I&#8217;m a novice baker and wonder if it&#8217;s possible to roll out the dough for this recipe using a large plastic tumbler.  I don&#8217;t own a rolling pin (just moved flats and there was none in the cutlery drawer), but will obviously run out and buy one if it&#8217;s definitely needed.</p>

				<p>I also have no cookie cutter and find that successive rolling out can make the later batches more tough as more and more flour gets incorporated. I&#8217;m just going to cut into squares &#8212; not so pretty but should taste as good.  I also think I might try making a long roll that I can slice ( like the old-style refrigerator cookies). For (109)  Jackie &#8212; try an empty wine bottle.</p>

				<p>The Sur La Table cookie cutters look exactly like the ones you have pictured, except that the seams are sealed better and they have rolled edges on the top so they don&#8217;t hurt your hands.  I purchased them a long time ago &#8211; well before I came across this recipe.  I&#8217;m so excited to use them for these cookies! :)</p>

				<p>These were a HUGE hit with my dinner guests.  I used a biscuit cutter, and the size was perfect.  We got Haagen Dazs pints in mint chocolate chip and coffee, and my husband just sliced the pints up and peeled off the paper&#8211;so easy! The cookies are good on their own, but their lack of sweetness was just ideal for this use.  Thanks, Deb!</p>

<p>Great recipe, as always. I&#8217;m also thinking of adapting it to a &#8220;vanilla&#8221; sugar cookie recipe&#8230;..the texture was/is great.</p>

				<p>I saw from your beautiful photographs that the cooked product stays true to the cut of the raw dough, so I selected this recipe for &#8216;gingerbread houses&#8217; and just added some ground ginger powder to the recipe.  They turned out perfectly and came together beautifully because the dough shapes I cut out for walls, roof, etc did not change size/shape during cooking.  I&#8217;m going to use this recipe again and again&#8230; because not all kids are such fans of ginger but everyone loves chocolate.  I&#8217;m loving your recipes and have bookmarked plenty for future use.</p>

				<p>Well, don&#8217;t try to bake them without sugar!  I was so pleased with how easy they were to mix up and how beautifully they rolled out, but the taste was &#8230;&#8221;something&#8217;s MISSING!&#8221;  I figured it out and rebaked.  They are wonderful &#8212; worth the extra round.  I&#8217;ve sent my husband out for peppermint crunch. I figure I&#8217;ve earned it.  </p>

				<p>i made these last week using low-fat drinking choc mix (all i had, emergency recipe change after i realised at 8pm on jan 1st i didnt have enough ginger to make gingerbread and needed cookies to take to my boyfriends family)<br />
they still turned out awesome. we tend to get smallish eggs in japan, but i also suspect i dont measure things properly lol so everything probably works out proportionately. i melted the butter slightly in the microwave first cos room temp here is too cold.<br />
lessons learnt: dont let boyfriend play with electric mixer.<br />
dont let boyfriend eat all the cookies. he would seriously eat the whole batch in one go.<br />
flour the insides of the cookie cutter regularly!</p>
<p>am making these again tomorrow with cocoa.<br />

				<p>I looove these cookies, and have made them before to go with strawberry ice cream (and that was divine).</p>
<p>But this week, I cut them into small heart shapes and sandwiched them with some pink-tinted buttercream for a Valentine&#8217;s treat to take into work.  They are AWESOME.  I toyed with making Deb&#8217;s homemade Oreos, but I really wanted a heart shape, so I used these instead.</p>
<p>They were absolutely not too sweet (something I worried about), but rather perfectly soft and a little salty and a great contrast to the sweet (traditional) buttercream.  A major hit at work and beyond.</p>

				<p>I haven&#8217;t tried it (but let us know if you do) but I&#8217;d be hesitant to. The wafers for an icebox cake need to be able to completely absorb the whipped cream and become cake-like&#8230; I haven&#8217;t seen many homemade cookies that can pull that off.</p>

				<p>Hmm.  I would call them Cocoa Cookies.  My texture came out not brownie-like at all, and while I think most desserts are too sweet, this was on the verge of not sweet enough.  I think it needs a) dutch-processed cocoa, which I didn&#8217;t use and would help with the bitterness I detected, and b) ice cream.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#8217;t make them again as a stand-alone.  Next, those delicious looking oatmeal cookies you posted!</p>

				<p>Someone mentioned re-rolling the scraps. Would you recommend re-rolling the scraps and baking the 2nd-round cookies or does the re-rolling really affect the baked result?</p>

				<p>I always re-roll the scraps, but it does affect the results slightly. Every time you re-roll, it picks up more flour, so the cookie will theoretically toughen &#8212; this is the case with all roll-out cookies. I try to do so as little as possible/be as efficient as possible when cutting shapes out.</p>

				<p>Deb, I have to say: I love your site, and I use your recipes so often&#8230;but this one is my favorite. I think I&#8217;ve made these for every major holiday and every birthday for two years, because everyone loves them. I even made them in star shapes for the last meeting of one of my college classes, my Tolkien class&#8211;stars for Elbereth, of course.</p>
<p>Long story short, you don&#8217;t know how grateful I am for this recipe and for your site.</p>

				<p>Deb, I just used this recipe to make a Milk Dud inspired chocolate cookie with a caramel filling.  </p>
<p><a href="http://adashofsass.com/2009/03/29/chocolate-caramel-cookie-bites/" rel="nofollow">http://adashofsass.com/2009/03/29/chocolate-caramel-cookie-bites/</a></p>
<p>This was the perfect recipe!!  Totally adaptable and I&#8217;ll definitely make it again (even without the caramel filling)!  The chocolate flavor was intense and you are right, it&#8217;s so much more than a chocolate sugar cookie.  :-)</p>

				<p>Before I go and fool around with your perfect recipe, and I feel okay asking you as I am tapping into your self-declared nit-pickiness, do you think that brown sugar would make these more chewy and moist? Or would the brown sugar drown out part of the chocolate flavour? But please know, I love this recipe and will definitely turn to it again and again!</p>

				<p>I haven&#8217;t tired it with brown sugar, but do let us know if you do and how it goes! My only concern would be that sometimes, brown sugar in cookies like this causes them to spread a bit &#8212; I would assume it&#8217;s the extra moisture due to the molasses in the brown sugar.</p>

				<p>Shouldn&#8217;t have fooled around with your perfect recipe, but doubt I have learned my lesson. I replaced the white sugar with brown sugar, &amp; added a teaspoon of instant espresso (dissolved in 1 tsp boiling water). The brown sugar made the cookies more dense, but in a heavy, dull way, not fudgy:( And even though you&#8217;d think they would be more moist with the extra moisture from the brown sugar, I needed to shorten the baking time from 10 minutes to 8 minutes, which is a lot, and they were still drier than the original! Espresso didn&#8217;t really enhance the cocoa flavour either; I think you have a perfect balance between chocolate flavour and sugar. The espresso just added a bitter hint. However, the brown sugar did not cause them to spread. So now I know not to fool with your recipes &#8211; thank you for entertaining them, though, Deb.</p>

				<p>Perhaps this has been mentioned &amp; I missed it &#8211; but I have heard about rolling cookies on a lightly floured board using powdered sugar in place of the flour to keep them from getting tough &#8211; would that work for these brownies?</p>

				<p>My husband LOVES ice cream sandwiches and is turning 40 this weekend.  He also has an obsession with cookie monster (strange, i know, you would never guess if you met him) so i was going to surprise him with cookie monster ice cream sandwiches at his party.  This recipe sounds perfect (and delicious!) but i was wondering if anyone had ever tried icing these?  do you think it would work/taste ok (for the cookie monster face)?  also if i bake them the day before will they still taste fresh?  Just found your blog, it&#8217;s wonderful!</p>

				<p>Deb, These cookies are incredible!!<br />
A friend of mine gave me cookie cutters in this exact shape and pointed me to this recipe, knowing full well I would have no choice but to bake them immediately. I did. And fell in love!! They turned out perfectly &#8211; crunchy outside, soft inside!<br />
I overcooked some of them a bit and they still tasted great (especially with sandwiched with some white chocolate ganache!)<br />

				<p>I made these over the weekend and used them for ice cream sandwiches.  They were quite good, very chocolatey and rich.  And the dough was surprisingly easy to work with, I had no problems rolling it out and cutting it.  Here&#8217;s my one pet peeve, though &#8211; don&#8217;t tell me to preheat my oven, then a paragraph later, tell me to chill the dough for an hour.  I know, I should read the whole recipe through first, right?  I did, but I still turned on my oven as directed and then realized 15 minutes later, that I wasn&#8217;t going to need it for at least an hour.  I&#8217;m sorry if I seem petty, I admit it is a silly thing to complain about!</p>

				<p>I just made these and they are currently chilling. I found the dough very hard to work with actually. I felt like there was too much flour and too little liquid. My mixer had a hard time keeping up, so I coated my hands in flour and dove in. It was easier to mix together with my hands. I do look forward to trying them though. And I want to use them for ice cream sandwiches. I won&#8217;t be making homemade today, but I&#8217;m going to use Sheer Bliss natural vanilla ice cream, (comes in a metal tin!)</p>

				<p>I&#8217;d like to bake ginger bread cookies that have the same wonderful texture as these.  Any suggestion how to adapt the recipe?<br />
By the way, I used ordinary Fry&#8217;s cocoa and they were delicious!<br />
I left out almost half a cup of flour because it got too hard to blend (despite using dry-ingredients measuring cups and so-called large eggs).  But it worked perfect!</p>

				<p>Some one asked before whether you could frost these: I made these this weekend in the shape of Jack &#8216;o Lanterns and iced them with good old buttercream and they are totally delish!! The cookies are not overly sweet so BC goes really well with it.  The buttercream dried overnight but it doesnt totally harden (if you want the icing to go really hard try using royal icing &#8211; I just prefer the taste of BC).  I used regular cocoa and thought they could be a bit more chocolately so will definitely try these out with dutch cocoa next time. Thanks heaps for the recipe!  By the way your photos are gorgeous! :)</p>

				<p>If anybody else is as stupid as me and pulls these out of the oven at time thinking &#8220;those aren&#8217;t done&#8221; because they look like they did when they went in.. they&#8217;re supposed to.  They kept their exact shape even through my over cooking, and they are quite good, even with crunchy edges.</p>

				<p>I found your website looking up challah, (I am know known as the challah girl) and stumbled upon several of your recipes.  I can&#8217;t tell you how obsessed  I am with these cookies.  These are by far the most incredible thing in the world.  I made them wrong the first time but not having soft enough butter, so i added some milk which still made them incredible but the second time around.  I can&#8217;t begin to tell you how obsessed I am with these cookies. Deb, please tell your mother thank you!!</p>

				<p>My second run of this recipe is still on the cooling racks, so I have to leave a comment (because my finicky internet ate the one last time). These cookies are awesome! Ironically, the first time the dough was super sticky and this time it wasn&#8217;t, but this time I also chilled the dough longer which I think helped. I used Hershey&#8217;s cocoa powder and after the rave reviews last week I am thrilled to bring them to my big family Thanksgiving!</p>
<p>Also, I suggest eating them with a smear of peanut butter between two of them; one of the most decadent things ever! :o)</p>

				<p>I made these last night. It took exactly 11 minutes like you said. Delcious! and I used Hershey&#8217;s. it is not too sweet, which is just what I like in my cookies. Thanks to Deb&#8217;s Mom for the recipe, and I&#8217;m glad you re-named it brownie roll-out because that is exactly how it tastes. Next time I must make mini ice cream sandwiches out of these.

				<p>I made these when you first posted the recipe and they were immediately my favourite.  Then a few months ago we found out our four year old has a whole host of allergies including wheat, milk, and eggs which makes baking a whole lot trickier, but I&#8217;m getting the hang of it. I decided to try these again with a few substitutions, and they turned out beautifully &#8211; my most successful converted cookie recipe to date.  Yay! I thought I&#8217;d post my substitutions in case any of your other readers have similar restrictions &#8211; 2 cups Bette Hagman&#8217;s gluten free mix, 1 cup sorghum flour and 1 tsp guar gum for the flour, 2 tbs flax mixed into 6 tbs of water for the eggs, and vegan margarine/shortening (I think I used earth balance shortening, either that or unsalted fleischman&#8217;s) instead of butter.</p>

				<p>BEST. COOKIE. EVER. This is the sort of cookie that I dream about, but hardly ever make because I simply cannot be trusted with them.  They are the perfect combination of brownie and cookie texture.  Make sure to roll them out thickly so they are slightly crispy/chewy around the edge, and rich and fudgy in the middle.</p>
<p>Ok, I have to get this off of my chest, the last time I made these I ended up eating the entire batch.  And by &#8216;the last time&#8217; I may mean the last three times. Oh, the shame!</p>

				<p>I used regular unsalted butter and Penzeys natural high-fat cocoa and they were very very good.  I made an ice cream sandwich with one and it was also delicious.  HOWEVER.  For me, what really took this recipe to the next level is making the cookies into a peanut butter sandwich.  I used creamy Jif and wouldn&#8217;t dare let the natural (grainier, healthier) stuff anywhere near it.  But you should decide how many of these you want to eat in advance because you will be in no position to make that decision once you have started.  Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day indeed!</p>

				<p>I baked these for Valentine&#8217;s Day using heart shaped cookie cutters. The dough was a little dry so some of the cookies were a little flaky looking on top. I&#8217;ll try either using bigger eggs or adding a little milk next time. The heart ice cream sandwiches were a huge hit and made for awesome pictures. My boyfriend double-fisted the cookies.

				<p>I&#8217;ll definitely have to try these babies out! i&#8217;ve always loved how sugar cookies look once decorated. The only problem is, not all sugar cookies taste good. BUT I HAVE A VERY GOOD FEELING THESE DO &amp; WILL. :)</p>

				<p>I am on my 5th time making these.  So yummy.  Tonight I used unbleached flour and had to at a little milk to wet the dough.  I&#8217;m wondering what else I can add to the base of these cookies as opposed to the cocoa powder.  I love the soft texture.  Was thinking ground almond and almond extract?  Maybe oats and some honey?</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s disgusting out today in NYC so I felt the need to bake a batch of warm cookies.  Limited by my pantry and no desire to run out to the store in the hurricane, I turned to these cookies using unsalted butter (meant to make up for this by adding more salt but then I forgot to do that, whoops) and regular cocoa (for some reason, I have a very hard time finding Droste in midtown though it&#8217;s also my preference). Feeling lazy, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to bother rolling out this dough so I patted it into a log and rolled it up in wax paper, stuck it in the freezer for 20 minutes, and then took it out and simply sliced treating them like a refrigerator cookie.  Less fuss and nothing lost for sure as these are  friggin&#8217; delicious and my husband, who loves, LOVES, simple foods, is in love with these.  I made forty (with 1/3 of the log still in the fridge for tomorrow) and we&#8217;ve eaten far too many of these already.  We did not make them into ice cream sandwiches but I will in the summertime with vanilla ice cream and coffee ice cream.  I also plan on trying these with a shmear of nutella for breakfast tomorrow.  In the future, I may try swapping out some of the cocoa for finely ground coffee to make a chocolate coffee cookie.  Around the holidays, I think these would be great with crushed up candy canes in them or rolled around the edges prior to cutting my log.  And since I have a bag of hazelnuts, I may make these next with finely chopped hazelnuts &#8211; like a nutella cookie without the nutella.  I absolutely love the texture of these and the flavor &#8211; just perfect &#8211; totally hit the spot on this dreadful day.  Thanks Deb &#8211; you never fail to please!  Also, I can&#8217;t stop making the cream scones and I always thought I hated scones&#8230; must stop baking now, too close to bathing suit season and still carrying some baby weight&#8230; sigh.</p>

				<p>These cookies&#8230; were soooooooo great. I am not a HUGE choclate fan, I usually enjoy chocoalte in something, rather then the main subject. These were grand. A friend of mine wanted to decorate cookies on valentines day, but she didn&#8217;t enjoy sugar cookies&#8230;. I wasn&#8217;t ready to settle for decorating choclate chip cookies and cupcakes aren&#8217;t exactly the same. I made a simple, but always great, frosting of a tbsn butter and milk melted (microwave) and mixed with powdered sugar to desired thickness. My roomie actually ended up smushing some ice cream inbetween some, but i prefered the frosted delights- but it may have had to do with how nice they looked frosted.<br />
great recipie nice, fluffy and soft&#8230; yet somehow carry a nice crisp to them. swell.</p>

				<p>I am making these today with a twist:  using this dough to follow Sprinkle Bake&#8217;s instructions for Celtic Knot Cookies. <a href="http://www.sprinklebakes.com/2010/03/celtic-knot-cookies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sprinklebakes.com/2010/03/celtic-knot-cookies.html</a> I plan to dust them with powdered sugar.

				<p>And&#8230;they are fantastic!  This dough turned out perfectly and was very easy to work with.  Since I was rolling it into logs and shaping it, I was particularly thankful.  For those who asked, the recipe can be halved easily and with great success.<br />
I think that you might get 18-24 cookies from a half batch&#8230;I got an even dozen of the special cookies I was making and used a golf-ball size of dough per cookie.</p>

				<p>I love the comment above mine from Lisa &#8211; yes, crack cookies indeed!!!<br />
I made them for the first time this past weekend, and have had a hard time not eating every single one of them. I did not have ice cream this time around but will definitely make them again SOON.<br />
they are delightfully delicious &#8211; I used organic dark cocoa powder which made them even more special.<br />
I have linked this page to the photo of them that I put on my Flickr photo page.<br />
EVERYONE should have this recipe&#8230;<br />
seriously doubt if I&#8217;ll make any other kind of cookies again.<br />
I&#8217;ll be back to Smitten Kitchen for other culinary adventures.<br />
thank you thank you thank you !!!</p>

				<p>*cry* it went all wrong!! I had the same problem those couple people had from the start: once i&#8217;d added the flour my dough became a dry crumbly mess!  I tried to salvage it by adding in some egg white to make it come together, but even though I added 3/8 c. I think I should have put more because the cookies were dry.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve got to assume it was the size of the eggs that made the difference, because even though I bought large I noticed they were a little on the small side, and I think I normally use extra large for baking.</p>
<p>Maybe I should try rolling them out to 1/4&#8243; instead of 1/8&#8243;, though, it might be better.  If I make them again, I&#8217;ll probably add a little less flour, or at least keep a close eye on the mixer when adding it so I can stop if I have to.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;ll teach me not to bake late at night!</p>

				<p>On a smitten cookie roll right now &#8211; made a half batch of these, silly me, and they disappeared before I had time to get the ice cream in between them and make a little chocolate dipping sauce, so another batch in the making.  I also made the brown butter brown sugar shorties for the second time this week &#8211; I am not going to pick favorites.  Thanks Deb for all the deliciousness.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m addicted to these cookies.  I have made them twice.  The first time I used them for homemade ice cream sandwiches.  The second time, I kept the dough in the fridge for a week or so and used the dough to make up a tray here and there.  I prefer them thicker so they stay soft though the crisp ones will soften overnight.</p>

				<p>these make amazing peanut butter sandwich cookies!  i used my linzer cookie cutters to make the top and bottoms so that the tops would have little star cut outs.  i am super excited to try them again with raspberry jam in between, yum!!!<br />
i accidentally ran out of flour while making these so one third of the flour was whole wheat &#8211; not bad, but next time with white flour they will be even better!<br />
thanks for the recipe!</p>

				<p>I made these as roll-out cookies last week, but had doubled the recipe.  Tired of all the rolling out (my least favorite baking activity) I took the remaining dough, and made two 2-inch logs out of it.  Left them in the fridge.  Yesterday, needing cookies for my son&#8217;s baseball game, and having no time to mix and bake, I took out the logs of dough, sliced off about 50 1/4-inch cookies, and baked them up, about 8 mins.  They kept their perfect circle shapes, and made for a pretty cookie.  Once they were cooled, I sprinkled them with powdered sugar.  So much easier, and just as tasty as the ones I did with all the rolling.  Love the dough; hate the rolling.  Just thought I&#8217;d share this easier option with others.</p>

				<p>I regret knowing this recipe but not making them for (literally) years. What a dummy! The dough&#8217;s currently in the fridge but I already know they&#8217;re going to be wonderful just by how good that batter was. Licking the Kitchenaide paddle with after making this cookie is the best.</p>

				<p>Hi! This is my first comment on this wonderful site, and being an Italian girl I apologize in advance for my poor English :)<br />
I baked these cookies yesterday and all my family adored them. Unfortunately I can&#8217;t find any US measuring cup here, so I had to search my house for a milk cup that contained precisely 240 ml of water and used it for this recipe: it was fun, and even though I was worried it would be unprecise, the cookies turned out to be great, with a rich flavor and soft in the center. The dough was a little too soft compared to the usual italian rolling cookies dough, but with some flour I succeeded in taking the rounds out.<br />
So, thank you for this one! I&#8217;m so happy I found The smitten Kitchen, I&#8217;m reading a lot of recipe and enjoying your pictures during these days, and I feel like I can trust you blindly :D</p>

				<p>I dont know why but these cookies did not work at all for me!  Even after putting down flour on the table, the dough got stuck to the counter!  I had to put it back into the the fridge and try again but by that time it already had 2 layers of flour.  I used a confection oven and they were already overcooked by 8 minutes.  I had a few cookies left to cook that were not part of the burnt batch so I cooked those for 6 minutes.  They came out much better but didnt end up tasting that great.  Any suggestions?</p>

				<p>Made these cookies today. Twice, at the request of my daughter. Being a somewhat lazy cook, I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to rolling the dough out so I made small balls of dough and pressed them to 1/4 inch or so with the bottom of a glass. Dipped the glass in sugar with each press &#8211; the same natural sugar I used in the dough in lieu of white sugar. Worked just fine. I cut back the flour about 1/4 cup in the second batch since the first was a little too dry and think it makes for a more tender cookie. Definitely will be making them again. And again!</p>

				<p>I just tried making these and they haven&#8217;t worked.. :( The dough was really sticky and I had to put it in the freezer to get it firm enough to roll out, and now I just looked in the oven and they have totally spread and not help their shape at all..<br />
I&#8217;m assuming I&#8217;ve got the measurements wrong as I had to convert to grams (I live in the UK).. I used a conversion chart I found online but anyway, I&#8217;ve gone wrong somewhere. :( so disappointed! I was really looking forward to trying them after so many positive comments!</p>

				<p>These were a huge hit at a get-together today! People kept thinking they had something like cinnamon or ginger in them&#8230;I kept saying &#8220;nope, chocolate.&#8221; The first thing out of their mouths was &#8220;they&#8217;re like brownies,&#8221; so you did a good job measuring.</p>
<p>Zoe-it must be the measurements. If it helps, 1 c of butter is a half-pound.  I thought the UK also used cups, but I guess the whole EU thing has gotten there! The cups would probably be better measured by converting to ml since the cup is a measure of volume.</p>

				<p>I have made these cookies a few times now&#8230;and they are loved by all!!! They really do taste like a brownie cookie&#8230;.fabulous. Great texture&#8230;I have also decorated them with royal icing&#8230;even though they taste great with nothing at all. I do think some cream cheese icing would be a great addition.</p>

				<p>Yum! My son has been asking to make Christmas cookies. I&#8217;m not a fan of sugar cookies and frosting, so I found this and had to try it. So yummy! I got a good cookie and he got to use his cookie cutters. Win/Win. Down side is I can&#8217;t seem to stop eating them. Good thing I only made a half batch. Thanks!</p>

 Great great great recipe. I made it as gifts for my sons&#8217; teachers. They were very appreciated.I just had one quick Q about the recipe, since the dough sits in the refrigerator for an hour, shouldn&#8217;t the preheating step be mentioned at the point when the baker is ready to roll out the dough?</p>

				<p>If you freeze them before baking, should you thaw them before baking or can you bake straight out of the freezer?  If the latter, how long should you bake them (for 1/4 inch cookies)?  Thank you!</p>

				<p>Made these tonight with two little girls, and they turned out perfectly!  Did a powdered sugar dusting and they look great for the Christmas cookie platter.  Used half regular cocoa powder, half fancy cocoa, fyi.  Thanks for the great recipe!</p>

				<p>Yum.  Just made these for my work cookie exchange and they&#8217;re great.  I know the beauty is supposed to be in the simplicity, but I iced them and sprinkled them with crushed candy canes.  Really yummy and great texture, though I do wish I&#8217;d splurged for better cocoa powder.</p>

				<p>Made these today with Christmas cookie cutters. The dough is amazing to work with as it doesn&#8217;t stick like a lot of other cookie dough recipe. Can&#8217;t wait to make these for every holiday, thanks for the great recipe :)</p>

				<p>I baked these today, and they are yummy.  I actually made the dough several days ago and kept it in the icebox.  It rolled out wonderfully.  I chose these to be my toddler twins&#8217; first experience making their own food.  They loved it, and they totally understood that *they* cut the cookies and then got to eat them.  It was great.</p>
<p>Also to note, I made these gluten-free.  I substituted a gluten-free flour mix and it was fine.  I also substituted finely milled raw sugar for the refined sugar, just personal preference.  I will make them again, but I will use a better quality cocoa.  I couldn&#8217;t find the good stuff.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing this recipe!</p>

				<p>Oh wow.  These were DELICIOUS.  However, I ran into the same problem several others readers faced &#8211; my dough was ridiculously dry.  I re-read the recipe several times over, but I knew I had followed it accurately.  Although dry, the batter tasted pretty good, so I decided to try something instead of scrapping it:  &#8211; I took about half of the uber dry batter out (because my KitchenAid was not liking how dry the mixture was)<br />
- Mixed in about 1-1.5 Tbs softened butter, and a whole beaten egg (all the eggs I used were large) until fully incorporated<br />
- Added the other half of the batter back and followed the baking instructions as written</p>
<p>They turned out fabulously; they&#8217;re quite possibly my new favorite cookies.  </p>
<p>Other things I did &#8211;<br />
(1) They didn&#8217;t need them, but I added some finely chopped 80% chocolate pieces to half the batch &#8211; soooo good when they were warm with little bits of melted chocolate!<br />
(2) Used 1/3 c regular Hershey&#8217;s cocoa powder and 1/3 c Hershey&#8217;s Special Dark cocoa powder &#8211; I&#8217;ve been doing this with all of my recipes and like the extra chocolate-y-ness.</p>

				<p>These cookies are beyond amazing! I was so excited about finding this recipe last night that I couldn&#8217;t sleep. For my son&#8217;s school bakesale today, I wanted a cookie that I could use a cookie cutter with but I didn&#8217;t want to make regular sugar cookies. This was perfect! This dough was the easiest, most forgiving dough that I&#8217;ve ever worked with. I didn&#8217;t stray from your instructions other than I have a super hot oven so 7 minutes was perfect for me. To make them a little more interesting for the kids, I made a 1/2 batch of your homemade Oreo cookie filling&#8212;-this amount was perfect for the amount of cookies that were made. I sandwiched them together and I&#8217;m positive they&#8217;ll be a hit at the school!! The only disappointment: This batch isn&#8217;t for me!!!! I might have to do it all again tonight and keep them for myself. Such chocolatey dangerousness!!! Thank you a million times over!!!</p>

				<p>I think i have a helpful hint. Instead of rolling the scraps out over and over on flour and worry about them getting too hard from all the flour, i rolled them out once on a floured board, then took the scraps and put them between a large piece of folded over cellophane, then rolled over the cellophane, nothing sticks, roller is clean. I did roll the scraps together and put back in frig. to harden up before i rolled each batch, but it worked well.</p>

				<p>I made these for the first time this weekend, and I too ran into the problem of a slightly crumbly dough (it certainly did NOT look like your picture). I&#8217;m not sure what caused the consistency to be this way (maybe my hand mixer?), but I found that working the dough with my hands (in small portions) helped it to hold together. I was then able to roll it and cut the cookies. I also found that underbaking them  slightly helped to give them the a chewy texture, although they didn&#8217;t seem to be as soft as you described&#8230;luckily my 3 year-old nephew loved them anyway!</p>

				<p>Made these cookies with a friend last night.  Decided spur the moment to make vanilla buttercream frosting and made some cookies sandwiches.  Best decision ever.  These cookies are delicious on their own, but with the frosting they are over the top!  Like a oreo, but a million times better!</p>

				<p>My batter is in the fridge as we speak and i cannot WAIT to make them! I was so afraid when i was making it because the batter was kinda sticky and stinking to the mixer, but i came on here and read all the comments and saw the picture and was relieved that it is suppose to do that and i am SOOOO excited!! Will report back after i make them! Has anyone ever decorated them with icing? Any suggestions or ideas? After they are made&#8211; how long will they last for? i Plan on doing them tonight but need them for saturday&#8211; think they will still be good if i put them in tupperware?</p>

				<p>Delicious!  I have tried making chocolate sugar cookies in the past and they were terrible &#8211; definately not chocolatey enough.  I think your title fits perfectly.  I baked a tray last night and ate three for breakfast.  I rolled and cut the rest of the dough and froze the cookies.  Do I need to let them come to room temp before baking or can they be baked straight from the freezer with an additional few minutes?  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>I was determine to make these cookies even though I discovered that I had (a) not quite enough butter (b) not quite enough flour (c) no rolling pin. And then I accidentally cooked them the entire time on broil instead of bake! The results? Delicious! These cookies turned out to be (thankfully) idiot proof!</p>

				<p>I made these cookies as a base for ice cream sandwiches, as recommended in your original post.  I made both vanilla and coffee sandwiches and they were a huge hit!  I had extra cookies left over and they were gobbled down rapid-fire at a family reunion.  The basic cookie itself is durable (and nicely transportable), yet soft (like the word &#8220;brownie&#8221; in the name implies).  Thank you for the recipe &#8212; I&#8217;m sure I will be making them again!</p>

I cut them out with star-shaped cookie cutters and made sandwiches with cream cheese frosting. Then. I decorated the sides with red &amp; blue sprinkles for a festive presentation.

				<p>I was searching for a &#8220;chocolate sugar cookie&#8221; recipe for my son&#8217;s Star Wars themed Birthday Party.  I am planning to make Darth Vader cookies using a Darth Vader cookie cuter.  This recipe sounds like it might be the one&#8230; especially since I am planning on serving the cookie as a topper for an ice cream sundae.  With the slightly soft texture, they will go so much better with the ice cream than the a hard sugar cookie.  My only question and concern is, do you think this cookie would take well to cookie cutters with detailed imprints?  I purchased the William Sonoma Star Wars cookie cutters and they are the type of cutters that have all of the fancy facial details, etc.   Thank you for posting the recipe!  Can&#8217;t wait to try it out.</p>

				<p>I baked these cookies today with my kids, but when my son was reading the recipe to me, he skipped the &#8220;chill for an hour&#8221; part, so we didn&#8217;t do that and they turned out great.  What does the chilling do?  Does it change the texture or moisture level or is it just to make them easier to roll/cut?  </p>
<p>Ours were a tad on the dry/crunchy side, so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking, but we had no trouble rolling them out and cutting them.  We&#8217;re decorating them with buttercream and they&#8217;re so yummy!</p>

				<p>I had a question!  I&#8217;ve made these cookies before and they were super wonderful, but I recently I bought a really cute cookie tin sheet with different shapes that you press the cookie dough into, and I was wondering if this recipe would still work as well? I really hope that it does! Any suggestions?</p>

				<p>Ok, so I tried baking these cookies in the press-into-different-shapes-sheet I bought and it didn&#8217;t go so well. It&#8217;s hard to gauge how think the dough should be in the little moulds! Thankfully, I had a backup plan and just used some cookie cutters I bought when I ran out for more flour! I want to try again with a little less dough and flatten it out even more in the little moulds.</p>
<p>Regardless of the derpy shapes I had, everyone loved the cookies. Super delicious as always!</p>

				<p>wow &#8211; i chose this recipe as my first-time-ever attempt at making cookies and they turned out ah-mazing!</p>
<p>As i had never baked before i was a little nervous when it came to handling the dough (fear of tough cookies!) and since i don&#8217;t have a mixer, i was also a bit nervous regarding doing everything by hand.</p>
<p>Seriously, I could not be happier with the outcome. These cookies are delicious, soft and thick and the dough is perfect cut-outs. My boyfriend, who had never made cookies before, couldn&#8217;t have been more excited. We really spent most of our Sunday afternoon decorating the cookies like 5 year olds. </p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to make these again!</p>

				<p>Love the simplicity! and the taste.. Since I&#8217;m allergic to dairy and eggs I replaced the butter for vegetable margarine, used egg replacer instead of eggs and doubled the amount of baking power (I find egg replacer doesn&#8217;t quite do the job on its own). They turned out great and are exactly as you descibe them! Since I&#8217;m Dutch I did use ofcourse Dutch cocoa!</p>

				<p>Very Yummy! Cut mine into hearts. Rolled the scraps into ball shapes; these were none too appealing, but better tasting since they were softer in the center&#8230;even more brownie-ish!</p>

				<p>I made this yesterday night..it came together so quickly with what I had in hand. I used Valhrona cocoa and just used the roll and cut technique.The shapes were a little mishappen, but using a serrated knife helped. My husband was craving brownies and he was surprised to see something on a weekday. They tasted heavenly with a glass of cold milk. Its a good thing I just baked up a few. Otherwise I can never get out of the gym.<br />
Thanks again for a wonderful recipe..P.S: we are planning up another Smitten thanksgiving for this year.</p>

				<p>Hi Smitten Kitch,<br />
The cookies were delish&#8230;. slightly salter and sweeter than we liked but still chewy and soft. </p>
<p>One disclaimer with this &#8220;recette&#8221; is that the batter ends up being quite crumbly and it is hard to roll properly and then make the cookie cut outs. Please advise. </p>
<p>P.S. We mixed the cocoa into the dry ingred list instead of the wet one, so maybe that made a difference.</p>

				<p>Hi Sharon &#8212; I&#8217;ve never had trouble rolling these out (I made them again just last week.) though the crumbly-ness of a dough can be affected even by the way flour is placed in a cup &#8212; I tend to scoop and sweep, getting cups of flour that weigh 125 grams. Hope that helps.</p>

Also this time I added a tsp. of cinnamon. I&#8217;m Mexican and chocolate without cinnamon is not the same. They turned out delicious. I might try to add a bit of spice next time ;)<br />

				<p>The consistency when I mixed these up seemed just right, but after refrigerating the dough I had the same problem as others. It was rock hard and very crumbly. I ended up rolling it into balls and pressing them with a fork like peanut butter cookies, baked them for 11 minutes and they were delicious. I would be happy to make these again, and if I want to roll them out I&#8217;ll just skip the refrigeration.</p>

				<p>I loved working with this dough &#8211; and the cookies are very tasty!  I used cocoa with some Dutch processed cocoa in it, as I didn&#8217;t want them to be too bitter. And I didn&#8217;t need to adjust it for high altitude (much&#8230; I added about 1/2 cup extra flour so that it wouldn&#8217;t stick to the beater), and the baking time was perfect for this elevation (7220 ft). Only one or two cookies puffed too much for being able to flood with corn syrup icing or royal icing. I&#8217;m eager to see how they&#8217;ll hold up in shipping, though, as right now they&#8217;re kind of soft.  If it doesn&#8217;t look like they&#8217;ll ship well, I know someone in this house who will happily accommodate making them disappear.</p>

				<p>I just made these for Valentines day. Yum. Your recipes are amazing.<br />
A few things: First, I partially flatten out the dough before refrigerating. Easier to finish rolling them than from a chilled ball of dough.<br />
Second, I rolled the dough out between two pieces of parchment, so no need for any flour. I do this trick with pie crust and other rolled cookies too.<br />
Last, the dough was rock hard after refrigerating. It was a lot of work to roll it out, even from the partially rolled out slab. Next time I will refrigerate for 15-20 minutes and then check to see if it&#8217;s firm enough. Otherwise, I guess you have to let it sit out for a bit.</p>

				<p>these aRE lovely valentines cookies.  i wondered, anybody have a recommendation for an icing with which to decorate these?  maybe it&#8217;s sacreligious, but I&#8217;m craving something else with these cookies&#8230;makes sense to me these are sort of a with-ice-cream cookie (though I&#8217;ve been eating them plenty on their own) &#8212; anyway, what icing/frosting would be good do we think?  It would also be pretty, right, something white or pastel on the dark dark cookie?</p>

				<p>I tried rolling these both thin and thick and the consensus in my house is that thick is much better!  They are a little plain on their own for my tastes, but they made excellent ice cream sandwiches.  Next time I would dust them with powdered sugar or maybe drizzle them with some type of chocolate or frosting.   I could also see these as jam sandwich cookies with raspberry jam and some almond flavoring in the dough!</p>

				<p>Thick is definitely better, but the name &#8220;brownie rollout cookies&#8221; set my expectations higher than was met.  This is a very basic tasting cookie, sort of like a shortbread though not as buttery as good shortbread&#8230;  Yes, I agree these would make great ice cream sandwiches, but as a standalone I&#8217;m not sure they were worth all the rolling.  I used a really expensive organic cocoa, too, so that wasn&#8217;t the issue.  Hmm.  They did seriously create a cold milk craving!</p>

				<p>Hi Ray &#8212; For stamp cookies, I&#8217;d roll them thinner. Growing up, we&#8217;d make them with a stamp-style cookie cutter (before they were spring-loaded and easier to use, sigh) and they held the marks pretty well. Not as well as a cookie without baking powder, but clearly enough.</p>

				<p>So so love these!  Returning to reprint because I misplaced my first.  One of my go-to cookies.  Yes, they hold stamping well (I&#8217;ve just used other smaller cookie cutters to make an imprint for birthday party theme&#8230;ie:  R/R on a circle for train crossing, or the birthday girl&#8217;s initials).  I like them especially with some fine piped royal icing detailing or sandwiching mint frosting.  We definitely like them thick and soft.</p>

				<p>I made these for a playschool party and they were a hit. I used 170g unsalted butter and added a pinch of salt, and stirred/mixed with a wooden spoon, not a mixer, which was fine. Refrigerated for an hour before rolling, then again before the next batch (got too soft as it&#8217;s hot where I live). I used small animal and shape cookie cutters and the recipe made 94 cookies! Then glazed them (3 cups icing sugar, 3-4 Tbsp hot water and 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice) with different colours. They were chewy and tasty! Thank you!</p>

				<p>Maybe why some people&#8217;s dough comes out crumbly: I have 2 measuring cups, and one measures a cup at about 110-113 grams, the other measures a cup at 145-158 grams (a 2-cup measuring cup, so also wider). I use the smaller cup to make recipes.</p>

				<p>I actually did get frustrated with the dry ingredients in the middle of the recipe because I just couldn&#8217;t get the wet and dry ingredients to meld together. So I actually added maybe about two tablespoons of milk and the dough still came out firm enough to rollout cookies, just in case anyone was wondering. But anyways the cookies are delicious! My favorite chocolate cookies by far.</p>

				<p>I would like to bake these for my daughter&#8217;s birthday party to stake into the centerpiece foam. Can they be baked on a stick or are they too soft to stay on?</p>

				<p>Fantastic website! You are just the person for my long standing question. Some 30 yrs ago when I was in HS the &#8220;lunch Ladies&#8221; made their own cookies. I will never forget them and to this day have never had one like it. they were chewy chocolate brownie cookies. They looked like they were baked in a muffin top pan. they were so dense that you could hold the cookie in the palm of your hand, make a fist and the cookie would actually stay formed with ridges that show your finger joints and peaks that divided your fingers. I have not been able to find the right ingredients to make cookies so dense and pliable with such chocolatey goodnes. I hope my description was able to do justice to such goodness. Thank you for your wonderful contributions to comfort food. YUM!</p>

				<p>The closest consistency to these famous chewy brownie cookies that I have experienced has been the 1/2&#8243; edges of some brownies. any suggestions or references you have would be fantastic. Thank you.</p>
