<p style="font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;">
    Here are the 6 <u>WORST</u> things you can do if you want to ignite your body's own fat-burning furnace and get lean, strong & totally ripped in less time:
</p>
  
<br>
  
<p><b>Mistake #1:  Doing isolated exercises</b></p>
  
<p>Doing isolated exercises like bicep curls and tricep kick-backs will <u>not</u> get you any significant results.  These one-muscle-at-a-time moves simply don't stimulate enough muscle fibers to build lean muscle or expend enough energy to maximize your calorie burn.</p>
  
<p>If you want to build lean muscle while burning fat so you can get serious definition, you need to perform exercises that stimulate as many muscles and expend as much energy as possible <i>at the same time</i>.  Using these types of exercises (which I'll reveal on the next page) will <i>dramatically</i> accelerate your results.</p>
  
<br>
  
<p><b>Mistake #2: Working out with machines</b></p>  
  
<p>Fancy machines may make the gym look high-end, but truthfully, about the only thing they're good for is for sitting down while you tie your shoes or catch your breath!  The problem is this: Machines alter the way your body naturally moves and restrict your range of motion.  This severely limits your ability to fully activate all of your muscles fibers -- that means <i>less</i> fat burning and <i>less</i> muscle definition.  Worse yet, machines can cause excessive strain on your joints, leading to nagging injuries down the road.</p>
  
<p>If you want fast results, it's critical that you incorporate exercises that allow your body to move <i>naturally</i> with full range of motion so you can skyrocket your metabolism and tone your entire physique.  In minute, I'll explain the <u>6 primary movements</u> that are the foundation of these full-body exercises...and I'll also fill you in on the best types of weights to use for your workouts.</p>
  
<br>
  
<p><b>Mistake #3: Doing long bouts of cardio</b></p> 
  
<p>Look, you need to do cardio if you want to lose weight and burn fat...BUT there's a <u>right way</u> and a <u>wrong</u> way to do your cardio workouts.  If you've been pounding the pavement or the treadmill with nothing to show for it (except sore joints and a pair of stinky worn out sneakers), you already know it takes a lot of effort to get minimal results. </p>
  
<p>In this article, I'm going to reveal the most effective way to pump up your cardio routine that will get you <u>insane</u> results in <i>half</i> the time of your regular cardio workout -- without causing unnecessary stress on your joints. Seriously, don't skip this article because once you learn this simple trick, you'll kick yourself for not doing it all along.</p>
  
<br>
  
<p><b>Mistake #4: Doing crunches and sit-ups to get 6-pack abs</b></p> 
  
<p>If you want washboard abs, doing traditional ab exercises like crunches and sit-ups WILL NOT get you a six pack.  In fact, doing <u>any</u> exercises that target your abs won't get you a six pack either!  These so-called "ab" exercises are a complete waste of time.  They don't make your abs get any more defined and they definitely don't burn any fat.</p>
  
<p>The key to getting sculpted abs is to burn off that stubborn layer of belly fat that's hiding them!  In the next few minutes, I'll show you how to burn away the "ab flab" while stimulating all <u>6 of your abdominal muscles</u> at the same time so you can finally carve out your six pack abs.</p>
  
<br>
  
<p><b>Mistake #5: Repeating the same workout routines over and over</b></p> 
  
<p>Repeating the same workouts over and over is a surefire way to STOP getting results.  We're creatures of habit and we tend to stick to things we're familiar with and good at.  But when it comes to your workouts, if you want to keep making progress and keep seeing changes in your body, you've got to start switching things up.</p>
  
<p>You see, your body has an amazingly ability to adapt quickly and when it does, that's when you hit the dreaded plateau and you stop making progress.  On the next page, I'm going to tell you exactly how often you need to change up your workout routine so you can keep your body guessing to accelerate the results process.</p>
  
<br>
  
<p><b>Mistake #6: Doing long workouts</b></p> 
  
<p>Longer workouts do NOT equal better or faster results.  If you've been slaving away at the gym and your body isn't visibly changing, you can't do more of the same thing and expect a different result.</p>
  
<p>When it comes to getting lean and fit, your body responds to quality over quantity.  I'm going to tell you the <u>#1 way to super-charge your workouts</u> -- this simple, yet overlooked method is the single fastest way to getting lean and ripped while cutting your workout time almost in <i>half</i>.  No joke - this technique will open up a can of whoop-ass on your workout!</p>

<br>

<p style="font-size:18px;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">
  Stop doing the same old workouts that haven't gotten you any results<br>
  and find out the <u>TRUTH</u> about how to get lean and ripped<br>
  with shorter, more effective workouts...
