A lot of times, a recipe comes with a story, and if you&#8217;re even luckier, it&#8217;s a good one. There are dishes that remind you of something your mama used to cook and unforgettable meals at far-flung restaurants that demand recreating in your own kitchen and fresh stuff that looked so pretty at the market, you had to come home and have your way with it. </p>

<p>This is not any of those times. I don&#8217;t have a good story about why I had to make a chocolate pudding pie this weekend or why you should before your weekend is done and gone, and I at first felt bad about this until I realized that at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3891002635/">37 weeks and 4 days pregnant</a> <i>not that anyone is counting or anything</i> one does not need a good reason to make chocolate pudding pie &#8212; they are the definition of one. Because did you read the part about the chocolate? And pudding? And pie? I did. I saw those three words together on Gourmet.com last week and had I been craving chocolate pudding before then? No. Did I know I was fixing for some pie? Nope. Did I have a good reason to make it? Well, not exactly, but I promise you, if you make chocolate pudding pie, the people will come.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3894899519/" title="chocolate pudding pie"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2625/3894899519_7f12b12185.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="chocolate pudding pie" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-4927"></span></p>
<p>Though you might have to then share it with them, which is inconvenient when you realize how good it tastes. It may not bring out the magnanimity in you (I at first typed &#8220;magnitude&#8221; but, well, that&#8217;s just <i>too easy</i>) but you&#8217;ll be relieved to know that as far as pies this pretty go, this one is particularly easy to make: a quick-baked shell filled with an even speedier homemade chocolate pudding and smothered with a generous helping of fresh whipped cream. It&#8217;s even easier to eat, but I suppose that goes without saying, even if you&#8217;re not the pregnant-est person in New York right now.</p>

<p><b>Chocolate Pudding Pie</b><br />
Adapted from <a href="http://www.gourmet.com/recipes/2000s/2009/08/chocolate-pudding-pie">Gourmet</a></p>
<p>One of my favorite things about this &#8212; besides the whole CHOCOLATE and PUDDING and PIE thing &#8212; is the way that despite its all-id, kid-like nature, this pie is surprisingly unsweet and not heavy. There&#8217;s barely a half cup of sugar in the whole she-bang and the lack of excessive richness (it&#8217;s a milk and cornstarch pudding, not a weighty egg yolk and cream custard) makes for something you can easily crave on a hot summer day, although you&#8217;ve already been warned that that craving may strike without warning.</p>
<p>One half-recipe of <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/pie-crust-102-all-butter-really-flaky-pie-dough/">All Butter, Really Flaky Pie Dough</a>, wrapped and chilled for at least 30 minutes</p>
<p><U>Pudding filling:</u><br />
1/4 cup cornstarch<br />
1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, divided<br />
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
3 cups whole milk<br />
4 ounces bittersweet chocolate (not more than 60% cacao), finely chopped<br />
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br />
1 cup chilled heavy cream</p>
<p>Bittersweet chocolate shavings for garnish (optional)</p>
<p><u>Prepare pie dough:</u> Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into an 11-inch round, then fit into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim edge, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang, then fold overhang under and crimp edge decoratively. Prick bottom and side of shell all over with a fork, then chill shell 30 minutes. While shell chills, preheat oven to 375°F with a baking sheet on middle rack. Line shell with foil and fill with pie weights*.</p>
<p>Bake on baking sheet until pastry is set and edge is pale golden, about 25 minutes. Carefully remove weights and foil, then bake shell on baking sheet until pale golden all over, 15 to 20 minutes more. Cool shell.</p>
<p><u>Make pudding filling:</u> Whisk together cornstarch, 1/3 cup sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a 2-quart heavy saucepan, then gradually <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/tips/a-whisk-for-the-corners/">whisk</a> [tips alert!] in milk. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly, then boil, whisking, two  minutes (mixture will thicken). Remove from heat and whisk in chocolate and vanilla until smooth.</p>
<p>Pour filling into cooled shell and chill, its surface covered with wax paper (if you want to prevent a skin from forming), until cold, at least two hours.</p>
<p>Just before serving, beat cream with remaining two tablespoons sugar until it just holds soft peaks. Spoon onto pie and garnish with bittersweet chocolate shavings, if you&#8217;re feeling fancy.</p>
<p><u>Do ahead:</u> Pie dough can be made and chilled up to two days. Pie, without whipped cream, can be chilled up to one day before serving. Whipped cream is best added at the last minute, however, I did find that ours held up surprisingly well for a day (so far), if you feel like winging it.</p>
<p>* Detour! This is where I admit that I for reasons both lengthy and boring, I really loathe working with pie weights and use a different technique to blind bake pie and pastry shells. Instead, I freeze my rolled-out shells for 20 to 30 minutes until solid, press a piece of buttered foil, buttered side down, very tightly against the frozen shell and blind bake it according to regular directions. When it is time to remove the weights, I carefully pull back the foil, and press any part of the crust that has bubbled up gently back with the back of a spoon and continue baking the shell. Try it!</p>

				<p>Aaah the spoon trick! I thought I was the only person who did that, I also LOATH pie weights with a passion, I bake my pie crusts blind with nothing in them, then half way through I remove from the oven and push down anything that has risen with the back of a hot DRY spoon and then back to the oven for the remaining minutes. People I work with look at me with disgust at times but hey, it&#8217;s easier and saves time and you don&#8217;t have to fart about with weights.<br />
I think I will have to make this, it looks delicious!</p>

				<p>What is with this pie?! It has been following me like a crazy delicious ghost wherever I go. Kind of like when your parents would buy a certain car and then it suddenly seemed like everyone in town had the same car. Yeah, sort of like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve been wanting to try the version of this from the Baked cookbook too. Thanks for the additional nudge!</p>

				<p>OMG. I am sitting at the computer editing an article on cold-frames, when your chocolate pie comes up on my yahoo reader. What? Can you say distraction? Not fair! Sigh. This looks so good it is killing me. The last chocolate pie I ate was a terribly disappointing slice at a diner that shall remain nameless. Can I whip up the energy to try this out later today? Only time will tell. I know I won&#8217;t stop thinking about it now&#8230;( having already broken down in looking at your gorgeous photos). I am not sure if I should say thank you or not&#8230; but I will. Thank you for leading my mind astray.<br />

				<p>Looks like a winner&#8230; will try this, but going to go with a graham cracker crust&#8230; maybe add some &#8216;mallows and blast with creme brulee torch?  Or drizzled with some caramel sauce and pecans?</p>

				<p>Chocolate pudding is one thing I do remember eating as a kid. My mom is Korean so baked treats and sweets were not part of my diet growing up. Dad could mix a jello pudding pack though. Thank goodness I went to pastry school. I love creme pies of all kind and of course won&#8217;t ever eat jello pudding anymore. Love how simple they are.</p>

				<p>Wow, this looks amazing!  And it would be a perfect treat to make on Labor Day.  The only concern I have is the very real possibility of eating it all myself.  It may be a chance I&#8217;ll just have to take.</p>

				<p>Aww Deb you look adorable! An awesomecup holder you&#8217;ved got there.. </p>
<p>The pie looks delicious. I have a flat whisk just like yours and wondered what special use it has. I still haven&#8217;t figured out. What all do you use it for? I just bought it because it looked really cute. hehe</p>

				<p>Oh sweet mother of God! The torture! I&#8217;ve been cooking like a fiend all summer,(fashion people go on hiatus in August),&amp; inevitably put on 8lbs from making pate sucrée and the like. Just when I think: fashion week is around the summer and I must go on a regime, you go &amp; post the acme of deliciousness&#8230;I&#8217;m going to be the plumpest fashionista ever! (Not that that is a bad thing per se, but I wld like to fit into my very expensive wardrobe&#8230;) LLGxx</p>

				<p>The chocolate filling sounds like how you would make the pudding version of your hot fudge sauce sort of.   I don&#8217;t doubt it appealed to you!  It works for me too, since I love your hot fudge sauce!  I am sold on the pie crust technique (fraisage) that is used in the crust recipe supplied with this recipe on Gourmet.  Gads, it makes pie crust easy to handle for those of us thusly challanged..even after all your tutorials, that trick is what made it happen for me.</p>

				<p>Oh my. My aunt made chocolate pie for Thanksgiving dessert a couple of years ago. It was overkill, really, after all the Thanksgiving food. But it was sublime. I can still taste it. Might have to have some soon, very soon.</p>

				<p>ha! my brother-in-law LOVES chocolate pudding pie.  in fact he usually makes one and brings it to Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners.  He&#8217;s just not into the cooked fruit pies (or &#8220;grown-up&#8221; desserts) that are traditional with these holidays. It&#8217;s become a family joke. His pie is about as low rent as they come &#8211; pre-made crust, box of pudding mix, spray can of whipped cream.  Done.  Maybe I&#8217;ll use this recipe to make him a &#8220;real&#8221; pudding pie. It would be his best day ever!</p>

				<p>This would&#8217;ve been the pie I made today had I not been talked out of hosting a BBQ. Apparently our friends (all law students&#8230;ugh&#8230; this needs to change) are too busy to relax on Labor Day. So here&#8217;s my question: What do you do with all the cake and pie you make? Do most of them freeze well?</p>

<p>Purple Foodie &#8212; <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/tips/a-whisk-for-the-corners/" rel="nofollow">This link</a> is buried in the recipe, which means that nobody will see it, but I actually added a note about that specific whisk and exactly what I use it for!</p>
<p>Gabriela &#8212; I share with friends. A few live nearby and generally don&#8217;t need to be asked twice to come over because I done baked pie again. I had intended to bring this one to a BBQ on Saturday but totally miscalculated how long it would take &#8212; not the labor, but the chilling-rolling-chilling-baking and chilling again.</p>

				<p>I make a chocolate pie that we just love.  I&#8217;m lazy and just use a large jell-o chocolate pudding and pie filling (cook &amp; serve, not instant).  I cook it according to the instructions, then add a jar of marshmallow cream.  I pour half into the crust then sprinkle 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips evenly over filling.  Then pour the remaining pie filling over the top.  After it is cooled I top with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.  The chips inside add a nice surprise and really add to the flavor.</p>

				<p>Ooh, what a childhood throwback! I&#8217;m so happy you posted this. :) Makes me think of summers when I was a little kid, fresh out of the pool, running around in a damp swimsuit, sucking down mouthfuls of my grandma&#8217;s pudding pie between activities. It&#8217;s dangerous for me to have it around now, though, because like you said, it&#8217;s so easy to eat (which, for me, is code for &#8220;I could shovel down the whole thing in a matter of hours.&#8221;)</p>

				<p>Deb, curious if you&#8217;ve ever made the Gourmet 2/04 Chocolate Cream Pie (I found it on epicurious.com).  That is my go-to recipe for this type of pie.  It uses a crust made from those delicious &#8220;Famous Chocolate Wafers&#8221;&#8230;it&#8217;s absolutely heavenly if you make it with the really good chocolate for the filling&#8230;.</p>

				<p>Replying to commenter #41: That&#8217;s my go-to chocolate pudding pie, too! Although those chocolate wafers are insanely hard to find, and even harder to find when you live in Mexico. (Although I could make Deb&#8217;s chocolate wafer cookie recipe and use that as the crust, but that&#8217;s too much for me.) Funny that I just realized after reading this post that I don&#8217;t NEED the wafers to make an awesome chocolate pudding pie. Maybe I&#8217;ll try Maria cookies for the crust instead&#8230;.</p>

				<p>Cooked chocolate pudding was one of my BIG nine months pregnant cravings (one of the few cravings I had that weren&#8217;t broccoli or strawberries!) &#8211; I had to make it 3 times before it tasted just right :)</p>

				<p>I have made this pie many times, and it is AMAZING.  It is definitely a go-to recipe for me on special occasions.  I make it with a crumb crust like the Gourmet recipe suggests, but I use chocolate graham crackers instead of chocolate cookies.  100% delish!!!!</p>

				<p>We always had this pie growing up. It is one of my favs. And once I started making it myself, my mother taught me a something&#8211; the chocolate pudding pie cook should always make a tiny individual pie for themselves in a ramekin, to savour later. Because why not?</p>

				<p>I totally made this tonight.  I needed to re-stock my baking pantry with cocoa and chocolate anyway&#8230; and as someone who&#8217;s familiar and comfortable with pie dough in general, the speed with which I could put this together was awesome.  I&#8217;m headed to a large family vacation next week and plan to make this for them (using the other crust I could get out of the butter crust), as I know it&#8217;ll be a crowd pleaser.  </p>
<p>I thought I needed an excuse.  Turns out a lazy Monday off from work is reason enough.  Once again, thank you, Deb.  Your kid sure is in for some good eating.</p>

				<p>Deb&#8211;<br />
I&#8217;ll be 30 weeks pregnant tomorrow and it&#8217;s been fun reading about what you&#8217;ve been craving. I seem to have regressed to my grade school diet and live off peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and pasta (I do sneak a lot of vegetables in with the pasta!) And chocolate pudding&#8211;specifically, Kozy Shack chocolate pudding&#8211;has been a mainstay. It&#8217;s just so good. If I have the energy before this baby comes, I&#8217;ll have to try this pie&#8211;it looks amazing. Hope you&#8217;re feeling good&#8211;and enjoy the next couple of weeks!</p>

				<p>During my first pregnancy all I craved was pie, Pie, PIE! Fruit pie, cream pie, pumpkin pie, pecan pie, bring it on, baby.</p>
<p>Second pregnancy and a bout of gestational diabetes, so &#8211; NO PIE.  Instead I craved spinach sauteed with garlic, tuna fish sandwiches (couldn&#8217;t have too many) and cantaloupe.  I hate cantaloupe, but I LOVED it when I was pregnant and the minute I wasn&#8217;t pregnant anymore &#8211; I hated cantaloupe.</p>
<p>I still love pie.</p>

				<p>Have you been reading the Sweet Potato Queen books?  </p>
<p>This is one good looking pie and, while it might not have a story for you, it does for me.  My mother had a long-term gentleman friend way back in my childhood for many years who used to pick up the most wonderful chocolate cream pie before paying her a visit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been baking my piecrust blind that way for years &#8211; but you can skip the trouble of the buttered foil.  Just freezing the crust will suffice!</p>

				<p>Hi, I just cooked and ate this (not all myself, I had guests tonight!!), using your recipe.  It was sensational.  Kids loved it, guests loved it, hubby  loved it and so did I.  </p>
<p>I used milk chocolate (which I think is semi-sweet?? in the US) instead of dark (which is bittersweet &#8211; yes? Im in australia and we have white, milk or dark chocolate) and it worked really well &#8211; I was using a good quality cocoa which has a very intense flavour and didn&#8217;t want it to be too much for the kids.  </p>
<p>Also hubby, being a non-cooking man got thickened cream from the supermarket accidentally, but I whipped that and it actually made a really lovely topping with a similar consistency to the chocolate part.  Worked really nicely.</p>
<p>Loved the pie-crust as well and my guests all want emails with direction to your website.</p>
<p>Thanks again<br />
Cait :)</p>

				<p>I was just recently thinking about my mother and chocolate pudding pie. She could take the simplest things and make us kids think she&#8217;s a gourmet cook. For example:cream of corn soup (one can of creamed corn and another of milk). One of our favorite treats(kids didn&#8217;t get treats as often then as now and that&#8217;s what made them so wonderful) was her chocolate pudding pie: graham cracker  crust, chocolate pudding and whipped cream. Heaven on earth!!!</p>

				<p>Mmmm&#8230;this brings me back to my youth.  I don&#8217;t think there was one visit to my grandma&#8217;s house where she didn&#8217;t have a chocolate cream pie waiting for us.  This is one of my ultimate comfort foods.  Thanks for sharing!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been making chocolate cream pie for years, but using the egg/custard recipe. I will definitely try this instead! Nice photo, too. On the blind baking, I have never used pie weights either&#8230;despise them&#8230;using a simple pie crust pricked before baking has always worked for me.</p>

				<p>my mom&#8217;s been making this pie since i was a kid, and now i&#8217;ve taken up the tradition. it&#8217;s outrageously easy and incredibly satisfying. plenty of times we even use jello boxed pudding mix and it still turns out great. also, i have to admit, i have never ever used pie weights, and i also never refrigerate my crust (i use shortening, not butter). my mom&#8217;s biggest trick was always &#8220;don&#8217;t play with it!&#8221; and it seems to work well.</p>

				<p>no kidding, just this weekend i scored some scharffen berger chocolate on super sale at williams-sonoma, and i was thinking that a chocolate cream pie might be the best way to feature it. &#8220;baking illustrated&#8221; (<a href="http://tiny.cc/WrrFD" rel="nofollow">http://tiny.cc/WrrFD</a>) has a genius crumb crust with their recipe that&#8217;s made of crushed oreos — cream filling and all — plus a bit of butter. i&#8217;m even more inspired after seeing this post! i have to say, as wonderful as that cookbook is, your photos are doing a lot more for me than the book&#8217;s line drawings.</p>

				<p>I tried your blind baking trick when I made this pie today.  Worked like a charm!  I don&#8217;t hate using weights, but this is much easier once it&#8217;s baked.  I sort of adapted this filling recipe a little.  I wanted it just a little richer, so I just added 2 eggs yolks to it, that&#8217;s all. The filling sure tastes good!</p>

				<p>Man, there should be a place for all the comments to go which have advice (or whatnot) from people who have already tried making the recipe, separate from the feedback &#8220;wall&#8221; for people who think they&#8217;d LIKE to try the recipe. I definitely search through all the comments before deciding whether to make the recipe, and having one place dedicated to all those who&#8217;ve tried it would be helpful! (Sorry, I know that you are 9 months pregnant and not looking for website advice).</p>

				<p>Mancakes, maybe us commenters can do the work? What if we type (in caps) REVIEW at the start of our comments if we have actually made the recipe? That may help when scanning the coments.

				<p>I made this yesterday for a nearly last minute barbecue, and let-me-tell-you Miss Deb, this is some tasty pie.  For whatever reason, this is the second time I&#8217;ve had trouble with the all-butter crust, but I blame my incompetence.  All I know is that that corn bread salad, roasted corn relish (I just posted it on my blog it is so, so good), pie, and beer made for one lovely evening last night.</p>

				<p>I agree with Kristen (comment 41) &#8211; I&#8217;m sure this one is good but the OTHER chocolate pudding pie on Epicurious is a keeper with that chocolate cookie crust.  In fact, now that I&#8217;ve seen your post maybe that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m making for my anniversary dessert this weekend.  Not so traditional but really what is the traditional 6-year anniversary dessert???</p>

				<p>mmm. This was delicious! For me, as soon as I saw this pic it did, in fact, bring back an old high school culinary memory. A good freinds mom used to bake these in bulk and any time we hung out at her house the freezer was stocked with these pies for us. We called them chocolate pudding cream pies. As long as we were being obedient good  high school kids&#8211; and not goin&#8217; anywhere too crazy, her mom was happy for us to hang out at their home and have as much as we wanted of this yummy dessert. Sound educational teenage guidance, wouldn&#8217;t you say? Cheers to you for still baking, writing, standing in the kitchen, blogging . . .  all the way up till now :)</p>

				<p>Wow, what a mouth watering post!  I love how you have made chocolate pudding so elegant.  I have seen chocolate pudding pie made with a cracker crust, but using a pie crust is a wonderful idea, and I bet makes things feel a bit lighter. I will be trying this one for sure.</p>
<p>Smitten Kitchen is a wonderful site and something that I know will never disappoint, it is very clear how much thought and care goes into it. You really are an inspiration, thank you!</p>

				<p>My grandmother who just passed away used to make this pie for me all the time growing up.  She got it out of the &#8220;old&#8221; Betty Crocker cookbook.  It brings back very fond memories for me.  Thank you for making me smile.</p>

				<p>Mmmm. I grew up eating pies like this,EXCEPT they were topped with meringue and baked or broiled for just a few minutes til the swirls colored (yes, just like lemon meringue pie). I suspect the pudding may have been sweeter than yours (and was enriched with the egg yolks from the eggs that provided the meringue), but the ethereal combination of creamy chocolateness and cloud-like top was a joy.It must be a Southern thing. No one else I &#8216;ve mentioned it to has ever heard of it.</p>

				<p>Chocolate pudding pie is my 10 year old daughter&#8217;s all time favorite&#8230;no holiday is complete without it.  I&#8217;ve been using my mom&#8217;s recipe which uses just cocoa to make the filling.  I&#8217;ll be tempted to add some additional chocolate this holiday season.</p>

				<p>This looks completely delectable.  The only way it could be better is if it were a lemon pudding instead of chocolate (I&#8217;ve been gorging on lemon buttermilk sherbet, at least one batch made a week).</p>

				<p>Don&#8217;t ever try to put yourself between a man and a good Chocolate Cream Pie&#8230;chances are they&#8217;ll take the Pie, lol.  However I have tried afew different versions (one from Cook&#8217;s Illustrated) of which I put my trust in (they will test a recipe to exhaustion before putting it in print) and although it is very good, it was more &#8216;labour intensive&#8217; than I would have liked.  This version looks simple, fast to throw together and very delicious.  A good chocolate cream pie should not have any lumps in it, carry a rich chocolate flavour with a creamy consistency and not too sweet!  Smitten Kitchen rocks with some amazing recipes of which I intend on trying once the cooler weather is upon us.</p>

				<p>&#8220;This is not any of those times. I don’t have a good story about why I had to make a chocolate pudding pie this weekend or why you should before your weekend is done and gone, and I at first felt bad about this until I realized that at 37 weeks and 4 days pregnant not that anyone is counting or anything one does not need a good reason to make chocolate pudding pie&#8221;</p>

				<p>Hey Deb!  I just made a vegan version of this, with four cups of almond milk and 2 cups of coconut milk.  Crossed fingers I think it worked great!  The pudding tastes fantastic &#8211; it&#8217;s chilling right now.  I licked the hell out of the pan.   Planning to top it with whipped coconut cream instead of whipped cream, and maybe some slivered almonds or chocolate curls, so we&#8217;ll see how that turns out.  ;-)</p>

				<p>Tried this today and it was my first ever utter failure at baking.  The pudding did. not. set.  I know you were not here in my kitchen so you probably can&#8217;t tell me what i did wrong, but any more specifics you can give about thickening up the pudding?  How long is it on the stove?  How briskly do you whisk it on the stove? How thick is thick?  Does it get thick like Jello pudding on the stove?  </p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

				<p>Hi Melissa &#8212; Not sure what happened (and it sounds like you&#8217;ve been reading my comments for a while with your &#8220;not here in my kitchen&#8221; caveat! Heh.) but I did want to say that despite their seeming simplicity, cornstarch-thickened puddings are known to be tricky. Sure, they work most of the time for most people, but, well, here&#8217;s what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684818701/ref=smitten-20/102-3034700-4923306" rel="nofollow">Joy of Cooking</a> has to say about them: &#8220;Many of our readers have wondered why, on occasion, their puddings, after having thickened properly in the sauce pan, suddenly thin out. This dismaying mystery has to do with the nature of cornstarch bonds, which are surprisingly fragile, especially once the pudding has begun to cool.&#8221; JoC says that you should not beat, blend or strain cornstarch puddings after they&#8217;ve been taken off the stove, even if they&#8217;ve lumped, just to pour them into the dish where they are supposed to set and not touch them before they have cooled and stiffened.</p>
<p>However, if yours did not thicken on the stove (it will thicken about halfway, and will be clearly thickened, but not as thick as a set pudding will get) it is more of a mystery to me.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been checking out your blog for awhile, and this finally insprired me to action. We had a couple of friends over for dinner last night, and I wanted something that was easy and served cold (record breaking heat and all), and so I made this pie&#8230;amazing! Totally easy, and not too sweet. It actually tasted like chocolate instead of chocolate flavored sugar goo. People went back for seconds, and that was after glutting ourselves on tacos. This is one that will definitely fall into the &#8220;hey, can you make that freaking awesome chocolate pie again&#8221; rotation. Thanks!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb, like Crunchy robot above, I made this for a dinner with friends on the weekend.  It was FABULOUS!! Exactly as you described, not too heavy or sweet.  I loved the slight saltiness of the pastry too.  And it was so easy to make!!!!!  We all had 2 pieces.  Thank you for a great recipe.</p>

This is the first time i tried anything from your website and now you&#8217;re my kitchen goddess!<br />
It turned out wonderful, and seeing how crazy humid it is in Karachi, i was really surprised when the pudding ACTUALLY SET.It never did in any of my previous pudding pies. My fiance loved it, and he loves me (:)) for it.</p>

				<p>Back from vacation and doing some catch-up reading of your posts and reader comments. This looks so utterly yummy, I can hardly wait to make it next weekend. I have to ask&#8230; how do you get such perfect slices with such a soft pie? Do you cool it to almost freezing, as you did with your brownies? I know it doesn&#8217;t affect the taste to have a lovely, triangular slice, but it sure is more appealing than the misshapen pie slices I typically end up with. Thanks! :)</p>

				<p>Hi Dawn &#8212; The pudding firms up decently, so it was just the matter of a very sharp knife, so you don&#8217;t have to drag it back and forth, oh and making sure you get right through the bottom, which because it is pre-baked, is super crisp. Welcome back!</p>

				<p>OMG.</p>
<p>OMG, OMG, OMG. </p>
<p>This. Is. THE BEST FREAKIN&#8217; CHOCOLATE PIE in the known universe.</p>
<p>My husband, who is otherwise a perfect, mannerly, easy-going gentleman who will sweetly eat anything I make and never has any opinions about it, will sit up and all but DEMAND I make him this pie. </p>
<p>What happened is I made it for company last Sunday, and sent the remaining half home WITH the company. (It WAS their pie plate, after all&#8230;only being polite&#8230;) Unfortunately the husband found out what I had done, and mourned the loss of that half a pie like it was a family member. Did I mention that he normally doesn&#8217;t give a darn about food, really? </p>
<p>Then yesterday we were at a restaurant with a bunch of friends, and within the course of the meal I turned to him and asked if he wanted something. Right in front of the friends, he promptly EXPLODED: &#8220;What I WANT is another chocolate pudding pie!!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Needless to say, I made him another. And also needless to say, I sooooooo didn&#8217;t mind.</p>

				<p>Hey Deb!!</p>
<p>I just made this, and it was completely and utterly fantastic. Orgasmic is probably a better word. My only question&#8230;I made the pie dough and used your pie weight substitute trick, which kept the crust from bubbling up, by the sides of the pie (which were long enough and crimped when the crust was dough) completely collapsed in the cooking process! I admit, I have never used pie weights before, but I&#8217;ve never had this happen before either and I&#8217;m totally bummed out about it. Do you have any tips or ideas?</p>
<p>*I guess I should add I&#8217;m from the south, so generally my crusts have shortening, and thus don&#8217;t use weights or foil during a blind bake. You just literally blind bake them for 15 minutes, with nothing covering or weighting. I&#8217;m completely baffled on what went wrong&#8230;</p>

				<p>Thank you so much for this recipe &#8211; especially the pie dough is such a keeper! I admit, I was mure than reluctant when I put it into the fridge because I seriously doubted this would work out. But boy, it did! Almost like puff pastry. I´ve already forwarded the recipe to a bunch of friends. This wonderful pie didn´t even last longer than 90 minutes in the office this morning ;)</p>

				<p>I grew up despising pie. Every holiday, we would have no less than 3 types of pies. But my mom knew me. She always made me that 1 chocolate pudding pie.<br />
When I &#8220;grew up&#8221;, I always offer to bring the pudding pie.<br />
NEVER should one feel guilt about making a chocolate pudding pie.</p>

				<p>I made two of these yesterday for my family&#8217;s Thanksgiving dinner (with a nod to my brother&#8217;s birthday on the 13th &#8211; chocolate pie was the only kind he&#8217;d eat when he was little).  I used my mother&#8217;s pie crust (as she had already made some for the pumpkin and apple pies that she&#8217;d baked), but otherwise followed the recipe.  I found the pudding thickened up much more quickly than I&#8217;d expected and the preparation was almost ridiculously easy and fast.  Everyone LOVED the pie &#8211; the consistency was perfect and the flavour a great match for the whipped cream.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>Thanks for another great recipe! I made this on the weekend for friends and it turned out beautifully. I followed your directions to a T, even for the crust baking &#8211; and I am never messing with pie weights again!  The pudding was chocolatey and silky and not too sweet, as promised.</p>
<p>Next time I think I&#8217;ll try it with a graham cracker crust &#8211; I think that will make it like the pudding pies of my childhood.</p>

				<p>I made this when I went to stay with my boyfriend&#8217;s family the other week, and it went down wonderfully! His usually very silent dad told me that &#8216;it was really quite good&#8217; and that it would be nice if he could have some more. Very high praise. Personally I loved it, but made the mistake of scooping out some of the lumps that formed after thickening the chocolate mixture and adding them to the pie. They tasted fine, but it looked all dimply on top, which is a shame when you&#8217;re trying to impress people. Rookie error&#8230;</p>

				<p>hi, just wondering about the recipe &#8211; why can&#8217;t you use more than 60% dark chocolate?  I have some 64% and 72% chocolate and I would be making this for someone who likes darker chocolate more than milk-ier types&#8230;is it something about the sugars or milk content in &lt;60% dark chocolates that is necessary for the pie to work, or is it just a taste preference thing?</p>
<p>thanks so much!</p>

				<p>The pudding is not particularly sweet and something above 60% could make it too bitter. If you like your pudding that way, of course, use whatever you&#8217;d enjoy.</p>

				<p>Because I was a gazillion months pregnant and I had totally forgotten about it. However, I realized in hindsight that they are very similar. The previous pudding recipe has slightly (like a tablespoon or two) more sugar and two ounces more chocolate. I would say that it is more intensely chocolaty than this, but this mildness of this works well in a pie shell. Hope that&#8217;s a helpful comparison.</p>

				<p>Hello Deb,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the fantastic recipe!  I made it last night for dessert.  My kids &#8220;fought&#8221; over who got to clean the pan out!  Needless to say that everyone loved it.  I thought I had bittersweet chocolate, but actually I had unsweetened.  I increased the sugar a bit and also added a bit more sugar to the whipped cream.  Everyone loved it, but I think next time I will use bittersweet chocolate.  I had a rough day at the office today, and a slice of this amazing pie made me feel so much better!  It still tasted good, the crust was not as crisp, but not soggy.  Thanks again.</p>

				<p>Wow. I will never buy pudding at the store again. The pudding in this pie is magic! I could live off this stuff! Not too sweet or heavy, so creamy and yummy! I made it with a graham cracker crust because I&#8217;m lazy and that only takes a few minutes to make. Thank you!</p>

				<p>Deb. . .made this wonderful pie yesterday for a &#8216;girl&#8217; dinner party.  Yes, I licked the pudding pan and then took a nap!  However &#8211; the crust was more than crisp &#8211; in fact it was downright hard when we cut into it.  Do you think I over- baked it?  Have to confess that I&#8217;m not an experienced &#8216;crust-from-scratch&#8217; baker so I was pretty careful with your instructions &#8211; nevertheless the crust was yummy but difficult to cut through with a fork.  So &#8211; the three of us tossed around ideas for what could have happened as we pretty much finished it off!  The pudding set up nicely by the way &#8211; and was a perfect sweetness &#8211; I am now spoiled!  I&#8217;m tempted to use a graham cracker crust next time but would really like to believe I can bake a decent pie shell. . .any ideas &#8211; other than practicing more?</p>

				<p>Hi Deb.  I&#8217;ve got a bun in the oven myself now, and baby was demanding this pie!  Unfortunately, my pie crust shrank.  I&#8217;m sure it will taste great just the same, but I&#8217;m a bit disappointed (and hoping it will hold all of the pudding). Any ideas on how to prevent this in the future? (I used your trick to avoid pie weights.) Thanks!</p>

				<p>I made this last night.. i cheated a little and used a premade, frozen marie callender crust, but it was amazing all the same. my only gripe was that it seemed a little TOO intensely chocolate for me &#8211; id like something a little milkier, i guess? any suggestions on how to change it up?</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve had this recipe on my mind since I saw it last summer (but, at the time, I was also super pregnant yet lacked Deb&#8217;s energy!).  I finally got to have it last night after requesting it for my birthday dessert.  My sweetie made it exactly as is, and it is wonderful!  The crust is the butteriest and flakiest pie crust I&#8217;ve ever had, and the filling is so chocolately delicious.  It is a bit richer than promised, but is that really a complaint?  It is the perfect level of sweetness, too.  He served us each a slice with a large fresh strawberry, which was perfect.  Make this pie immediately!</p>

				<p>I made this tonight and it&#8217;s wonderful, except, my pre-baked pie crust turned out tough.  Now truthfully, I put a meringue topping on this because that&#8217;s how my husband&#8217;s grandmother does chocolate pie, and he likes what he likes.  I say this because the meringue meant that after everything was all done and chilled, I topped it and stuck it back in the oven for about 10 minutes to brown/cook the meringue.  Would putting a pre-baked crust back in the oven turn it tough? &#8211; Too much baking? or do you think it actually wasn&#8217;t baked enough to begin with.  I&#8217;m pretty careful in my dough making and don&#8217;t tend to have this problem with two crust pies.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.</p>

				<p>This. Was. DELICIOUS! The pie crust sounds labour intensive and much more effort than cheating and buying pie crust &#8211; but it is 100% worth it. I&#8217;d not yet made a successful pie crust untill this foray into deliciousness, and I wanted to say thank you! It&#8217;s a lot easier than it initially seems. And the pudding is a piece of cake!</p>

				<p>I made this yesterday when boyfriend and I went to his grandmother&#8217;s for coffee. It was a hit, there wasn&#8217;t anything left over. Best of all, my pie dish was a little smaller then the one recommended in the recipe, so we had some filling left over to have for pudding last night!</p>

				<p>This looks great! Have you ever made a French Silk Pie? I just made one (literally 30 minutes ago haha) and it is very light and creamy and just plain delicious. So easy too! It&#8217;s basically raw eggs, butter, sugar, and unsweetened chocolate beat together until fluffy and then poured into a pie crust and cooled in the fridge. Highly recommended! I would love to see pictures of one you make :)</p>

				<p>i just tried this recipe as a starting point: substituting coconut milk for the cow milk, a graham crust for the pie crust and also doubling the bittersweet.  (i never have exactly the ingredients around, but generally find that there&#8217;s something that&#8217;ll do!)<br />
anyway, this version was also delicious- and without any vegan qualifiers, even- although it took 6 hours to fully set&#8230; maybe that has to do with the coconut milk&#8217;s proteins being so different from cowmilk&#8217;s?  hmm.</p>

				<p>When my daughter recently requested a chocolate pie, I knew SK would not falter (I was tired of my old recipes, and needed something fresh).  I did cheat and use a Mrs. Smith&#8217;s pie crust (I didn&#8217;t have the energy to make my own &#8211; don&#8217;t judge me). Man oh man is this our new favorite chocolate pie! Incredibly easy and oh so good! Will be making another this weekend.  Thanks so much for such reliable recipes (nothing I&#8217;ve tried has failed me yet).  Looking forward to the cookbook!</p>

				<p>My 5-year-old daughter is allergic to both soya and milk, so for the pudding I substitued milk for rice milk and butter for vegetable oil (olive oil in my case, I&#8217;m Spanish!, but I guess cornflower oil would work well. You wont be able to taste the oil on the pudding I promise you). It came out delicious! Everybody, and my girl of course, loved it and it has become a regular at my home this summer.</p>

				<p>Hey Deb,this Thanksgiving was a &#8220;fridge clearing&#8221; event at my house- Long story short, only using ingredients already on hand. Made your lovely chocolate pie pudding and substituted the milk (not enough to spare, so many other things to cook) with &#8220;lite&#8221; coconut milk that I had on hand, it&#8217;s the only thing I changed with the pudding part, it was gorgeous, sooo silky!!! I was doing other pies and didn&#8217;t want more pastry so I did a pecan macadamia nut crust- the combo was dreamy! Everyone&#8217;s fave, glad I found you!</p>

				<p>Sasha &#8212; It should be a bit more firm. Cornstarch puddings, however, are notoriously finicky. Finicky to the point that every time I post one, I swear I&#8217;m not going to post another one ever again because of the handful of people who don&#8217;t get my results. So, it&#8217;s not just you. Hopefully, it is still delicious, even if it doesn&#8217;t cut cleanly.</p>

				<p>Ok, so this might be a really stupid question, but I&#8217;ll still ask it:<br />
when you say &#8220;not more than 60% cacao&#8221; does that mean that a 61% wouldn&#8217;t work? I know you said that it&#8217;s a matter of taste, but I don&#8217;t find any good quality chocolates at exactly 60%, so I have to choose between 61% and 55ish%, and I don&#8217;t want my pudding to be too bitter or not chocolate-y enough. This chocolate pudding is what the boy asked instead of a birthday cake, so it has to be perfect :) I really liked your description of it, as &#8220;surprisingly unsweet and not heavy&#8221;, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking&#8230; Which one do you think would work best?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry if it was indeed a stupid question (even if teachers all around the world taught us there&#8217;s no such thing ;) ) and thank you in advance for your help, it&#8217;s always appreciated :)</p>

				<p>If you&#8217;re nervous about bitter, go with the lower cocoa percentage. However, I think you&#8217;ll find both to have similar results.</p>

				<p>Deb, I was wondering if you thought this pie could be made ahead and frozen?  I&#8217;m going to a pie making party tomorrow and the pies won&#8217;t be eaten until Thanksgiving.  My plan is to use a graham cracker crust, at the request of a few finicky family members, if that makes any difference.</p>

				<p>Thanks so much Deb! I finally went with the 61%, because I thought you were right that it wouldn&#8217;t make such a difference. And it was sooooooooo good. Everything you said plus some unbearable cuteness brought by the mini-sized pies I made: it would be a dessert for two, so full size would be difficult to eat (well not exactly difficult, but then a WHOLE pie for TWO? you see we&#8217;re I&#8217;m going&#8230;) or to store for several days. So, I baked mini-sized pies in two ramekins, filled them up and topped them with the cream. So cute, so tasty, sooooo good. And the boy loved it ;) Oh, and the pie crust? I&#8217;m just trying to stop myself to re-roll the scraps I kept in the fridge, bake them, and eat them with the filling left-overs&#8230; I&#8217;d call it chocolate pudding pie frozen fondue, and I&#8217;m going to stop right here :p</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>E.</p>

				<p>Erin &#8212; I haven&#8217;t tried freezing it. I&#8217;m hesitant about how well cornstarch-thickened puddings freeze; I seem to remember something about the cornstarch bonds not holding up in the freezer but could also have remembered this incorrectly. Some help I am, huh?</p>
