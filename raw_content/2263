			<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/82516192@N00/387114468/"><img height="332" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/175/387114468_aafd1be340.jpg" width="500" class="width_500 frame-img"/></a> <br />I&#8217;m sure everyone has his own favorite lasagna recipe, but I&#8217;d just like to offer that this really<em> is</em> The Best Lasagna Ever. Part of its appeal is that the ingredients used are totally basic; you don&#8217;t have to hunt down fresh basil or buffalo mozzarella or Parmigiano-Reggiano or handmade sausage from from an Italian mama in old Napoli. Anyone can make this, anywhere, anytime. And it&#8217;s the easiest thing in the world.</p>
<p>Aside from the simplicity and availability of ingredients, however, this lasagna is <u>just</u> <u>dadgum</u> <u>good</u>. Before Marlboro Man and I met, I cooked this for an older guy with whom I&#8217;d had a couple of dates. The next day, he told me he&#8217;d added me to his life insurance policy. <em>It&#8217;s that powerful</em>.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve made this lasagna for various categories of humans: men, women, democrats, republicans, dimwits, scholars, and foreign dignitaries. I even donated two pans to a charity auction once. The overwhelming consensus has always been that it&#8217;s &quot;The Best Lasagna Ever,&quot; which is precisely what I&#8217;ve been trying to tell you turkeys. So let&#8217;s get started! </p>
<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/82516192@N00/387085600/"><img height="332" alt="DSC_0003" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/162/387085600_1a86dcb22c.jpg" width="500" class="width_500 frame-img"/></a><br />The Cast of Characters. See how, um, <em>basic</em> everything is? The recipe even calls for KRAFT Parmesan Cheese, of all things. For goodness sake, please don&#8217;t tell <a href="http://www.mariobatali.com/">Mario Batali</a>. </p>
<p>Are you ready? Here we go&#8230;</p>

I like to leave some in there, though, because it tastes better and because I&#8217;m a naughty girl. So please don&#8217;t be a health nut and drain it all, for pete&#8217;s sake.</p>

Add <strong>1/2 teaspoon salt</strong> to the water, as well as <strong>1 tablespoon olive oil</strong> to keep the noodles from sticking. Cook the noodles &quot;al dente&quot; so they&#8217;ll still have quite a bite to them. When they&#8217;re finished cooking, drain, rinse with cool water, and lay the noodles flat on a sheet of aluminum foil. That way, they&#8217;ll be easier to handle later.</p>

IMPORTANT: If the thought of cottage cheese makes you want to rent your garments, take heart: <em>you won&#8217;t even know it&#8217;s there</em>. Marlboro Man wouldn&#8217;t touch cottage cheese with a ten foot pole, yet he loved this lasagna so much&#8230;he married me.</p>

<p>
<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/82516192@N00/387100828/"><img height="332" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/183/387100828_07a95cf1f6.jpg" width="500" class="width_500 frame-img"/></a><br />Let the assembly begin! Lay four cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of the pan, overlapping as you go.</p>
<p>
<p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/82516192@N00/387101288/"><img height="332" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/176/387101288_53ca82f00e.jpg" width="500" class="width_500 frame-img"/></a><br />Spread half of the cottage cheese mixture evenly over the noodles&#8230;</p>
<p>

This particular brand of cheese was cut very thin, so I had to double up the slices to make 1/2 pound. Don&#8217;t let this throw you off&#8212;some brands are cut thicker, and would only require a single layer of slices. NOTE: I prefer sliced mozzarella, but you can certainly use grated mozzarella if necessary.</p>

Add another layer of four lasagna noodles&#8230;</p>

<p>Now pop it in a 350-degree oven for 20-30 minutes, until hot and bubbly. (Alternately, you could cover and freeze it, unbaked, at this point. OR cover and refrigerate, unbaked, for up to two days before baking.)</p>

				<div itemprop="instructions">
				<p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and salt.  After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Cook lasagna until “al dente” (not overly cooked).</p>
<p>To assemble:<br />
Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary.  Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly.  Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese.  Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top.</p>
<p>Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.</p>
<p>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or bake immediately: 350-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until top is hot and bubbly. </p>

			<p>If you really want to simplify your lasagna try not boiling your lasagna noodles.  Prepare and layer all ingredients as given, however, use uncooked noodles&#8230;It works, I have been making mine this way for 30 years.</p>

			<p>pre sliced, non buffalo Mozzarella? Pre grated, dried parmesan? Breakfast sausage? Dried herbs? Oh my.</p>
<p>I will attempt this recipe, but I think it would make such a difference (and a much more Italian lasagne) with proper fresh buffalo mozzarella, fresh parmesan, fresh herbs and quality fresh minced pork meat. Possibly some Tuscan tinned tomatoes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure this is great and all your other recipes look mouth-watering. Keep up the good work.</p>

			<p>Thank you for sharing the best lasagna recipe ever.  I dont like lasagna, but I loved this one.  I think the spicy hot sausage did it for me.  What a great site, too.  I will be trying your bread pudding next.</p>

			<p>This lasagne is amazing.  I lived in Florence for 4 months and have never been able to find a recipe that makes me feel like I&#8217;m sitting at an authentic ristorante.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  Next, chocolate cake&#8230;it looks to die for!</p>

			<p>Using slices of cheese is really a neat idea. I never would&#8217;ve thought to use anything other than shredded!</p>
<p>Also, I love cottage cheese, but I&#8217;ve always been a bit wary of its use in lasagna. I may have to try this though&#8230;</p>

			<p>I admit it.  I was skeptical.  It seemed too simple and my lasagna is usually froofy.  But wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.  This IS the best lasagna ever!  It&#8217;s deliciousness is in its simplicity.  Just perfect. Thanks.</p>

			<h4>Daniel <span>On Saturday, June 30 at 10:57 pm</span></h4>
			<p>When I came across this recipe, I thought it was NUTS to put breakfast sausage in a lasagna. And, like others, I was a bit put off by the dried herbs and stinky foot parmesan in a can.</p>
<p>But I had most of the stuff on hand already, so I figgered I&#8217;d give it a whirl. I had ricotta and shredded mozzarella/provolone blend on hand, so I used that, but otherwise I followed this recipe. Oh &#8212; I did use another poster&#8217;s tip and didn&#8217;t cook the noodles.</p>
<p>I would now like to offer the most humble of apologies to the incredibly talented Pioneer Woman. Please forgive my turned-up nose and my fear that this recipe would be much to bourgeois for my highly refined tastes. I&#8217;m stupid, you&#8217;re a genius. I&#8217;m a fool, you&#8217;re Einstein. I lose, you win.</p>
<p>Man, this is some stinkin&#8217; fantastic lasagna. I can scarcely describe how easy and delicious this turned out. My wife and I ate it until we were seeing lasagna spots before our eyes. I have dreams of serving this to friends at a fancy dinner party, then cackling with glee when I reveal the ingredient list to them.</p>
<p>My only word of warning comes from my deviation from the recipe. When I make this again, I&#8217;ll make sure the sauce is a little more juicy, and make sure I get the dry noodles covered completely. We let some of the noodles hang out, uncovered, and they didn&#8217;t get fully cooked.</p>
<p>Bravo, Pioneer Woman! Bravo!</p>

			<h4>Laura <span>On Thursday, July 5 at 12:01 pm</span></h4>
			<p>My 14 year old son loves lasagna, more than anyone should love it. He has a hollow leg when it comes to lasagna and he could eat a whole pan by himself if we let him. </p>
<p>And that is exactly why when I saw this recipe I tripled it and saved two to put in the freezer. This was a HUGE hit in my house, so simple but one of the best lasagnas that I have made. </p>
<p>I love your blog, I love your pictures, but your recipes, oh man! I will be trying out more!</p>
<p>Next week is my husband&#8217;s birthday so time to try out the sinful cake!</p>

			<h4>dopey <span>On Sunday, July 8 at 8:40 pm</span></h4>
			<p>It is absurd to claim &#8220;the best in the world&#8221; of anything, espcially something as local as &#8220;lasagna&#8221; and its myriad of variations. I can&#8217;t see the addition of jimmy dean pork sausage any different than a pork-beef-veal mixture which is certainly more traditional. I do like the layering of the mozzarella; that should add a nice layer of texture. I think everyone should make lasagna and use what is local, fresh and what you like. Try adding chopped black olives to the sauce, or chopped fresh tomatoes to the sauce before you bake it. I find a layer or two of fresh spinich leaves or zucchine add a great lightness to an otherwise often heavy dish</p>

			<h4>Amanda Swenson <span>On Thursday, July 12 at 9:07 pm</span></h4>
			<p>I made this lasagna with hopes of having leftovers.  My husband (the considerate person he is) invited people over at the last minute for dinner.  More than one person said, &#8220;This is the best lasagna I&#8217;ve ever eaten.&#8221;  It&#8217;s simple, doesn&#8217;t use pricey ingredients and is, well, I&#8217;ll agree with my husband&#8217;s friends, the best lasagna I&#8217;ve ever eaten.  It&#8217;s a regular dish now and my dad loves to come eat at my house (4 hours away).  Thank you so much for posting your recipes!!  They have been printed and bound in plastic sleeves in my home-made cookbook!!</p>

			<h4>Darlene <span>On Saturday, July 21 at 3:34 pm</span></h4>
			<p>One thing I do is use the small-sized loaf pans. I use one noodle and I place the small end of the noodle in the long side of the pan. I make my layers, and just fold the noodle over each time. (Or you can break the uncooked noodle in 3 parts, just make sure you start with some sauce on the bottom of the pan.) Layer as you indicated and then you have several pans that you can freeze and heat later. I place a layer of plastic wrap on top of the pan, then a layer of foil &#8211; otherwise it eats through the foil. BTDT. Just remember to remove the plastic wrap BEFORE you cook it. lol &#8211; don&#8217;t ask!<br />
I just pop them out of the freezer and pop into the toaster oven at 350 for about 45-55 mins. I&#8217;d remove the foil during the last 30 mins or so of baking.<br />
If you&#8217;re going the uncooked noodle route, just add a little more water to the sauce before you layer it. It will be absorbed by the noodles and be the correct consistency when cooked.</p>

			<h4>Scoutmaster <span>On Wednesday, July 25 at 9:37 pm</span></h4>
			<p>I wanted to make a lasagna for the Scoutmasters&#8217; Dutch Oven Cookoff at the summer camp our Troop attended last week, and remembered to print out your recipe. While I have lots of other lasagna recipes, I remembered that yours used simple ingredients (important since I didn&#8217;t know what type of stores might be near the camp) and meaty (also important since the judges would be college-age men).</p>
<p>Since I only had one dutch oven and the campfire, I had to improvise a bit.  I cooked the sauce first leaving the lid on so that it would hold more of the moisture in.  This worked out perfectly with the oven-ready (no-cook) noodles I used. After the sauce had simmered for the required time, I spooned out as much as I could into a bowl and began layering back into the dutch oven.</p>
<p>After the lasagna was done baking, I had about a 15-minute walk to the judging area, and since the cast iron holds heat very well, it was still bubbling when the judges opened the lid. One of the other contestants commented, &#8220;that looks like something from a restaurant!&#8221;</p>
<p>The lasagna was an easy first-prize from the hungry summer camp staff (they ate thirds).</p>
<p>Thank you for the awesome recipe!</p>

			<h4>Jody <span>On Thursday, July 26 at 11:14 am</span></h4>
			<p>Wow!  I&#8217;ve tried lots of recipes, trying to get that, &#8220;Oh Mom, can we have THAT for dinner tonight?&#8221; like I do with other family favorites.  I know when the kids like something when it&#8217;s QUIET at the table&#8230;everyone&#8217;s stuffing their faces full!  The amount of mozzerella and breakfast suasage is the key&#8230;makes it very unique, almost like pizza, but not.  I have to say hubby and I were on our third helping, looking at each other like we knew we were gonna be rolling from the table with extended stomachs, it&#8217;s that good!  And I LOVE having leftovers of good dinners&#8230;.cuz I can have them for lunch!  Oh, and hubby said he was going to try to stop by home tomorrow so he can have more.  Hope there&#8217;s some left&#8230;.:o)  Awesome recipe, Ree!  I&#8217;m excited to try the cinnamon rolls&#8230;&#8230;!</p>

			<p>I just recently found your site and decided to make your homemade lasagna recipe&#8230;the first time I&#8217;ve ever attempted homemade lasagna.  I have to say it is the BEST ever!  My hubby says I need to make it once a week now. Can&#8217;t wait to try more of your dishes!</p>

			<h4>Jenn Bo <span>On Saturday, August 4 at 1:32 pm</span></h4>
			<p>Fabulous recipe!  I must confess that I played with the ingredients a bit.  Fresh mozzarella, provolone, ricotta, grated parmigiano reggiano, fire roasted canned tomatoes (pureed in the blender), fresh hot italian sausage from the market and fresh lasagna noodles.</p>
<p>But I know the truth; it&#8217;s the meat mixture.</p>
<p>As evidenced by my husband who ate the entire top layer of meat from the leftovers.</p>

			<p>So this isn&#8217;t lasagna so much as some kind of a prefab beef casserole?</p>

<p>In the interrim, my herbs don&#8217;t come from jars; my cheese doesn&#8217;t come from canisters, and I don&#8217;t cook with ground beef and/or Jimmy Dean sausage that is squidged from a plastic roll.</p>

			<p>With the lasagna recipe can I subsitute reg sausage instead of the hot. Can you really taste the hottness after it cooks with the rest of the ingredients? </p>
<p>I really enjoy your journal. Just came across it from Nance&#8217;s. I&#8217;ll be a regular visitor from now on. I also copied off the Best Choc cake recipe. Will try both of these soon.</p>

I love your site, so entertaining! Light and fun! I REALLY heart your recipes. Your lasagna is sooooooo good. I made it for dinner for my family and they raved about it.

Just want you to know that you are appreciated! I am in the process of printing all your recipes.

			<h4>Carm <span>On Monday, August 27 at 7:41 am</span></h4>
			<p>As an ethnic Italian, I will try your recipe for the &#8220;fun of it&#8221; after all the &#8220;wow comments&#8221;, however, would it be so difficult to use freshly made marinara sauce with sauteed garlic, basil, Contadina crushed Italian tomatoes, Contadina tomato paste, olive oil etc. for the &#8220;sauce&#8221; part?<br />
You can add true Italian sausage taken from its casings (sweet or hot) to the ground beef and instead of cottage cheese which is NOT Italian, use large conainer of Ricotta cheese to which you blend in a beaten egg or two, basil, pepper, etc&#8230;&#8230;..mozarella as you mention, either sliced or shredded.<br />
That would be more authentic and definitely NOT ANY MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOURS. But, your website is great.  Also, for anyone going through all this, make enough for two&#8230;&#8230;.bake one to eat and freeze the other unbaked (they later heat up well from the frozen state&#8230;&#8230;just takes longer).<br />
Real Italian lasagna using ricotta cheese is not any more difficult than using cottage cheese&#8230;&#8230;ditto for the home made sauce, and Italian sausage, sweet or hot, crumbled into the ground beef.   Spinach Lasagna or Mushroom Lasagna is also good for the vegetarians out there.  A tip re aluminum foil wrapped lasagna to &#8220;store&#8221; in frig.  Often the foil leaves residue of aluminum on the tomato sauce topped lasagna. Better to cover with saran wrap, then foil&#8230;.with a note to remove saran before putting in oven.  That&#8217;s only if you are storing it for baking later or the leftovers.  Something re the acid in the tomatoes and the aluminum foil interacting.</p>

			<p>I didn&#8217;t totally scan all of the comments so if this variation has been mentioned I&#8217;m sorry.<br />
My husband can&#8217;t have any red meat. (don&#8217;t mention that to MM I wouldn&#8217;t want to be responsible for any heart attacks at your house)<br />
I just tried this today because yours is so close to the version I used to make, with Turkey Sausage and ground Turkey. I went for the &#8220;high fat&#8221; ground turkey, it was 85/15. You just have to watch it for burning!<br />
The sauce tasted &#8220;just like&#8221; the version with beef. I am an avid beef lover and I really couldn&#8217;t tell a difference.<br />
My hubby will be thrilled to be able to have lasagna again!</p>

			<p>This tasted delicious, as advertised, but I had to cook it at 350 for an hour&#8230;.20-30 minutes and the cottage cheese was still bright white and you could see the individual pieces.  I covered it with foil, and it needed the whole hour.  Thanks!</p>

			<p>OK, we just ate it and it was TERRIBLY salty.  Either I added too much, or it calls for too much?  I&#8217;d make it again and skip the salt (1tsp + 1 tsp).  I also didn&#8217;t use the spicy sausage, I used Italian, so I wouldn&#8217;t do that again.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>

			<p>Made this lasagna tonight. Got rave reviews from both my teenage boys. (Hubby said he likes my regular lasagna better, but he doesn&#8217;t do well with change&#8230;) I only had a small bite as I&#8217;m on a low-carb diet, but what I did eat was excellent. Another winner, Ree!</p>

			<p>Hmm&#8230;I wonder sometimes why people leave such negative comments in public places&#8230;well Ree, I hope you don&#8217;t take them personally!  I for one love the simple ingredients, as I can&#8217;t usually get my hands on ricotta cheese or fresh herbs, and can&#8217;t afford them when I do find them!  (Grad student budget&#8230;)  This is one of your recipes that I haven&#8217;t tried yet, but I think tonight might be the time to give it a whirl!  Thanks for sharing! =)</p>

			<p>It was very good but a bit too salty for me as well. I&#8217;d probably omit the second tsp. The best lasagna I ever had was easy on the meat and sauce&#8230;but this was very, very good and I can see why people like it so much.</p>

			<h4>Belles in Texas <span>On Sunday, September 16 at 6:50 pm</span></h4>
			<p>I&#8217;m making this lasagna tonight.  It&#8217;s in the oven now, and I&#8217;m having a hard time keeping the drool off my keyboard.  I love simple lasagna recipes and this can&#8217;t get much better.  I did balk at the use of Cottage Cheese.  I like to eat it cold, but mixed with egg&#8230; *gulp*.  I figured if Marlboro Man could eat it, I should Cowgirl Up and try it myself!  Will let you know.  PS  Made the Peach Crisp the other night.  I used fresh ground nutmeg and it made it the dominant flavor &#8211; will try using less of that next time.  Might toss in a handful of oats to the topping too.  I like mine with a bit of crunch.  Delicious though &#8211; OH, I used frozen peaches &#8211; the fresh ones are not very nice here in Texas &#8211; wrong time of year.</p>

			<p>The lasagna was good with except for the salt.  Wow, it was too salty.  Next time I&#8217;ll cut it out all together.  My husband likes less acidic tomato sauces, so I will add a tablespoon of sugar or cut up a carrot for the sauce.  Otherwise, it was delicious.  Used Italian sausage though &#8211; didn&#8217;t find the Hot sausage as the recipe called for.</p>

Then I met an Italian Stallion from New York City and fell in love.<br />
From a Polish cousin-in-law I learned the art of homemade lasagna &#8211; how to cook the &#8220;gravy&#8221; all day with fresh basil so that the smell fills the house!  </p>
<p>I tried this &#8220;best ever lasagna&#8221;, and it doesn&#8217;t even come close to the real thing.  Lead in the belly is more like it.</p>

			<p>Why do people leave such negative comments!!! Correct me if I am wrong, but this site is about family pleasing, down-home cookin’………it doesn’t claim to be “low fat”, “low carb” or “authentic” anything. If you are dead set on using “fresh herbs” and “hand-grated” cheeses……go right ahead…….but I don’t know why, if you are an authentic Italian cook, or even realted to one, that you would be perusing a web site by a “Pioneer Woman” for recipes………I think you might be a bit far from home………or maybe you have the shape of Italy (boot) mixed up with a “cow-boy” boot????? No spurs in Italy…….</p>
<p>Girl, this site is about selling Jimmy Dean sausages and Kraft pretend cheese in a box. Don&#8217;t kid yourself it&#8217;s anything else.</p>

<p>Is anyone actually dumb enough to think this blog is written by an actual person? raher than an Ad agency selling Jimmy Dean sausages and Kraft Garbage in a box. LOL This is a poorly disguised advertisement. Nothing else. LOL<br />
No-one in their right mind would make Lasagne this way. LOL add some salt, see if it helps.</p>

			<h4>Mark <span>On Monday, October 1 at 12:55 am</span></h4>
			<p>I just made my SPINACH LASAGNA and I think it is so much better. You won&#8217;t make it on any food channel with ingredients like that. Com&#8217;on Breakfast sausage? Canned tomatos? Dried Processed Parmesan cheese? Whats next Kraft mac &amp; cheese in your Alfredo?<br />
 I only use fresh!!!<br />
Italian sausage, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, and three differant kinds of tomatos. Fresh basil, EVOO, oregano, and garlic, and thats just the sauce. I use Ricotta cheese mixed with fresh spinach, fresh Parmesan cheese, fresh Mozzarella cheese, and garlic. NOT cottage cheese (yuk)<br />
Assembly is pretty much the same though<br />
its Lasagne, its the same anyway.<br />
But I top mine with more Mozzarella, and fresh Parmesan cheese. I also put on some whole spinach leaves for color (Red, White, and Green for Italy).<br />
I will be happy to send you a pic. If you would like to see my recipe, I can send that too.<br />
I&#8217;m not going to try this one, don&#8217;t think Breakfast sausage should be used for dinner, and Hambuger is just for Hambugers. Do you like Hambuger Helper also?<br />
Good luck with that&#8230;</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m with Mark. Anyone who makes a Lasagna this way deserves taking outside and shooting. But Mark, (sic) you are missing the point. This is not a blog by a real person, this is an advertising agency selling Jimmy Dean sausages, LOL In fact, send me an email, and offer me a job, I could write far more realistically than this.</p>

			<h4>skater <span>On Wednesday, October 3 at 9:56 am</span></h4>
			<p>I made this today and it is really delicious.  I admit this is the first time I&#8217;ve ever purchased canned parm and was a little bit afraid of it!  The only changes I made to your recipe were to skip the dried basil and use italian seasoning mix instead, and use only 1 tsp of salt in my doubled recipe.  We don&#8217;t use lots of salt and our tastes have adapted to that so I figured the dish would be salty enough and it is.<br />
This tastes great and I agree that it&#8217;s a nice option for those who don&#8217;t have access to fresh mozz and herbs etc.<br />
I have used hot breakfast sausage in my chili before but never thought of lasagna. Thanks for this delish recipe.  I know my crowd will be very happy at dinner tonight!</p>

			<p>Ree &#8211; I can&#8217;t think of how odd it must feel to have folks debating your existence! Especially by someone who seems to be talking to himself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d have to ask myself &#8211; am I real? Then I&#8217;d probably be caught up in existential angst, at least until it was time to hang out the washing.</p>
<p>I do hope you receive some recompense from Kraft &#8211; and not just a lifetime supply of shaky cheese! It takes a lot to run a ranch.</p>

<p>for those that are posting negative comments or think the website is made by kraft and jimmy dean: if you don&#8217;t like the food or think it&#8217;s a conspiracy for free ads, why do you come here? there are plenty of other websites that will have more complicated recipes more worthy of your tastes. no need to be hateful here.</p>

<p>You are OFFICIALLY my favorite blogger out there.  Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>We pretty much have the exact same recipe, BUT I put a block of CREAM CHEESE in my cheese mixture.  It&#8217;s a great addition, so give it a try sometime.</p>
<p>I also use a large jar of my favorite tomato sauce instead of the cans of whole tomatoes &#8211; with a little sugar as well.</p>

			<h4>Patrick <span>On Saturday, October 6 at 11:55 am</span></h4>
			<p>I&#8217;m not a professional chef but cooking is a personal hobby of mine. I always assumed lasagna was something terribly difficult but this was very easy. I couldn&#8217;t get all the ingredients as listed and I was happy to find that it doesn&#8217;t really matter. There aren&#8217;t breakfast sausages per se in Asian supermarkets so I just used ground beef + ground pork + salt/pepper/soya sauce/worchester sauce + onions (kind of ad-hoc ingredients for a burger patty but without the flour). </p>
<p>You can use variations on things like cheese, meat (vegetarian anyone?) and it&#8217;ll still turn out ok. The best part is that you can get everything in your supermarket for $40 and it&#8217;ll feed 2 people for a week. </p>
<p>Just wanted to thank you for posting your information freely on the net. Looking forward to your next recipe. </p>
<p>BTW anyone thinking this is an advertisement for those products is nuts. This is posted on the *web*. What are the chances that you&#8217;re going to get exactly those brands of ingredients in your supermarket? The only thing that I got that was from the same source was the meat. Guess cows and pigs are the same across all countries, gee that must be an advertisement! </p>
<p>Ignore the negative feedback, people like myself who are just looking for good information without all the pretentiousness of &#8220;pro&#8221; cooking sites, this is the place to be.</p>

			<p>Well i made this tonight. I even used all fresh ground mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. I have to say It tasted good however It did not taste anything like Lasagna. I enjoyed the taste however it is like when you have one of them chili cook offs and someone always brings in some Chicken soup thing and call it there special chicken chili, Its Good but it taste nothing like and Is not Chili. Anyway good recipe if your looking for something easy and different.</p>

			<h4>Dang! Mark's Right!! <span>On Sunday, October 7 at 10:01 am</span></h4>
			<p>Wow, Mark. You&#8217;re right! This blog, Ree&#8217;s other blog, <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/">http://thepioneerwoman.com/</a>, all those photographs and her delight in photography, the stories of her and her family over the last year and a half, the recordings of her kids voices (and her burps!) have all been a deliberate ruse to get us to buy Kraft Parmesan Cheese. Yes, Kraft is *so* desperate for our business they manufactured this whole family, this whole ranch and false history so we&#8217;d buy their cheese. You sure are smart.</p>
<p>Amazing how they&#8217;ve kept the same kids to model over this time! Same man posing as the husband and father, same dogs. And the details! Boy, they&#8217;ll do *anything* to make sure we&#8217;re shakin&#8217; a little more powdered cheese on our food. My eyes have been opened. I&#8217;m so relieved you were here to point it out to us.</p>

			<p>Ree, I simply adore your site and am so glad to have found you.  I&#8217;ve turned some friends on to it already.  I can&#8217;t wait to try this lasagna on my picky family.  I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll love it.  Funny thing about them is that when I try some fancy gourmet super wazoo meals on them, they hate them but when I fix simple, unpretentious meals, they rave.  PLEASE don&#8217;t pay attention to these negative comments and continue to do what you do so well.</p>

			<p>Have Mercy!!   I just found your site this evening and I&#8217;m ready to try everything!   I love the way you set up your recipes with the photos&#8230;by the way I read your NikonD80 camera recommendation and tutorial.   Excellent!  I&#8217;ve been looking for an upgrade &#8211; not quite sure I&#8217;m ready for that beauty, but I&#8217;m keeping it in mind.<br />
You have such a sense of humor &#8211; making your two sites delights and I plan on coming back and coming back!<br />

			<p>I&#8217;m 26 yr old male that&#8217;s been trying to get away from fast food and mircowaves, and spend more time in the kitchen.  This was probably the most work I&#8217;ve put into for cooking so far in my short cooking career, but once I got going it was pretty easy. Your blog and step by step pictures and instructions were awesome.  I love your site, keep up the great work!</p>

			<h4>Melis <span>On Thursday, October 11 at 9:51 am</span></h4>
			<p>Oh. My. Goodness. I FINALLY made this lasagna. I printed the recipe weeks ago and finally had a reason to make it. I had 5 friends over and they nearly emptied my pan. It was so good! </p>
<p>I live in the midwest, where hot dishes like these are definately comfort foods. The only variation I made was that I used mild sausage instead of hot. Those of us that are of Scandanavian descent can&#8217;t handle too much &#8220;kick&#8221; in our foods. <img src='http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<h4>sue <span>On Thursday, October 11 at 10:09 am</span></h4>
			<p>Ree, by the way how DO you accomplish all those quick succession shots? I&#8217;m assuming that you use a motor drive on your camera (just like the Hollywood &#8216;Paps&#8217;) and that since it is lightweight, it really is no problem for such a camera fanatic to shoot all those great sequential cooking shots. </p>
<p>What I admire is your lighting, babe; you do such a good job! Do you use any reflectors or other lighting gadgets? It feels like we&#8217;re standing in your kitchen looking over your shoulder (and drooling over your Jadite while we&#8217;re at it!)</p>
<p>Keep it up,Ree, we&#8217;re nuts for this site&#8230;..and sorry, Marks, this just isn&#8217;t the site for you, but no need to make disparaging comments. Disagree if you must, but politely, please.</p>
