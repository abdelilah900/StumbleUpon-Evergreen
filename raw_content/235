						<p>Sports has a way of making an impression on us, leaving lasting memories and untold "Where were you when..." moments.</p><p>Witnessing history is something that draws us to sports in the first place, whether it's the unexpected (Kobe's 81) or the all-but-assured (1992 "Dream Team"), but on-field performance isn't the end-all, be-all in sporting lore. No, things as simple as putting lights on a pole or projecting a yellow line 10 yards downfield on TV have had seismic impacts as well.&nbsp;</p><p>In that vein, we'll retrace a rich, clogged and sometimes unfortunate history as we explore the 200 most important events to ever happen in sports.</p>

						<p>Syracuse Nationals owner Danny Biasone may have saved the NBA when he introduced the shot clock in 1954, considering clock killing and menial attendance numbers clogged the hardwood in years prior.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.nba.com/analysis/00422949.html">Just look at this most egregious example of clock-killing:&nbsp;</a></p><blockquote><p>The lack of pace in NBA games in the early 1950s was widespread, typified by a game between the Fort Wayne Pistons and the Minneapolis Lakers on Nov. 22, 1950. The Pistons defeated the Lakers 19-18 in the lowest scoring game in NBA history. Each team had only four baskets, and Fort Wayne outscored Minneapolis by the underwhelming margin of 3-1 in the fourth quarter.</p></blockquote><p>Gross. Thanks, Danny. You made the NBA watchable.&nbsp;</p>
