<p>I&#8217;ve been on a pound cake kick lately. Last weekend I made two of them. One plain and another with strawberries. They both turned out really yummy.</p>
<p>Then, this weekend I wanted to try my hand at petit fours. You know … adorable, tiny layered cakes filled with fruit or frosting and covered in poured fondant or icing. They can be made from sponge cakes, genoise cakes, or pound cakes. Ding. Ding. Ding. That means more pound cake for me. I decided to go the whole nine yards. Little layers, syrup, marzipan… Looking back, I think my kitchen wishes I went the easy way. I should have just sliced 1-inch thick pieces from the pound cake loaf and then then cut out tiny cakes with a cutter. But no … that would be too easy.</p>
<p>Okay, before we get to the petit fours, let me tell you about the two pound cake loaves.</p>
<p>First up. Cream Cheese Pound Cake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3759762099/" title="IMG_0759 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3462/3759762099_b1c4d01eb5_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0759" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t wait to slice into it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3760560780/" title="IMG_0776 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2505/3760560780_c7bfc8dbbd_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0776" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3760561008/" title="IMG_0786 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3466/3760561008_dbddf2d3c8_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0786" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Oh my… help me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3760561328/" title="IMG_0793 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3490/3760561328_ff491b494a_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0793" height="750" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And the top… I could tunnel right through this thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3760561780/" title="IMG_0815 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3456/3760561780_ace66ec151_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0815" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>But first, a little cream cheese icing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3759764303/" title="IMG_0867 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3512/3759764303_05364b22ff_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0867" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, it was as good as it looks.</p>
<p>The recipe made enough for two loaves, so on the second one I added some strawberries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3760567042/" title="Untitled-1 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2479/3760567042_8e4525ede5_o.jpg" alt="Untitled-1" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was pretty fantastic, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3759764699/" title="IMG_0881 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2533/3759764699_f452155638_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0881" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Every last piece of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3760563380/" title="IMG_0981 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3500/3760563380_23666094ff_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0981" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>Strawberry Cream Cheese Pound Cake = YUM!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the recipe:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cream Cheese Pound Cake</span><br />3.5 cups all purpose flour, sifted<br />1 tsp baking powder<br />1 cup butter, room temperature<br />8 oz. cream cheese, room temperature<br />3 cups sugar<br />1 tsp vanilla<br />6 eggs, room temperature<br />1 cup milk, room temperature</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 325 degrees.<br />Sift flour and baking powder in a medium bowl and set aside.<br />Using a mixer, cream butter, cream cheesea nd sugar for about 6 minutes.<br />Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.<br />Add vanilla and milk until combined.<br />Add flour mixture until completely combined.</p>
<p>Pour into two greased and floured <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fhg%255F0%255F9%26field-keywords%3Dloaf%2520pan%25209x5%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Dgarden%26sprefix%3Dloaf%2520pan%2520&amp;tag=bakerella-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">9 X 5 loaf pans.</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bakerella-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" alt="" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" /></p>
<p>Stir in  2-cups hulled and diced strawberries for each loaf if desired.</p>
<p>Bake for about 60 minutes or until done.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:85%;">Update: Ummm… Forgot to mention… some of my strawberries sank to the bottom, You know I don&#8217;t bake with fruit so much, but after reading up on it, I think this will help. Try lightly covering the fruit with flour. Let me know if it works for ya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cream Cheese Icing</span><br />4 oz. cream cheese, room temperature<br />2 Tbsp butter, room temperature<br />2 cups powdered sugar<br />3 Tbsp milk</p>
<p>Cream butter and cream cheese. Add sugar and milk until thoroughly combined.<br />Spread on top of cake.<br />Store in the refrigerator.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now for the petit fours…</span></p>
<p>First, let me say… these were a lot of work. I&#8217;m glad I tried them, but a lot of work. Thank goodness they tasted great.</p>

You&#8217;ll need two sheets to lay sideways so you can lift the cake out when it&#8217;s done. Use some butter and coat the paper. Then dust with flour.</p>
<p>I used the pound cake recipe above, minus the milk and strawberries and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes. Also, I accidentally omitted the milk. Turns out that was probably a good thing, because the cake baked right up to the edge of the pan. It might have spilled over with the milk.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3759769591/" title="Untitled-3 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2538/3759769591_72b44bd307_o.jpg" alt="Untitled-3" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After the cake is baked and cooled, trim off the outer edges and then cut it into eight equal sections. Next, use a serrated knife and cut the height of each section in half. Turn each layer cut side up and apply a small amount of syrup. I used a spray bottle, but you can also brush it on. Don&#8217;t saturate it though. Then spread on a thin layer of warmed raspberry jam so that you can still see the cake through the jam. Stack the sections three layers high. (three layers of cake and two layers of filling.) Four would have made it too tall, based on the pound cake recipe used here.</p>
<p>Syrup = 1 cup sugar plus 2 cups water. Bring to a boil for approximately 3 minutes. Let cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3760567706/" title="Untitled-4 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3489/3760567706_3e86bd19fa_o.jpg" alt="Untitled-4" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Now, for marzipan. I finally found a reason to use this stuff. It has an almond flavor and is pretty tasty. Marzipan sometimes goes on the top layer of the petit four and I think really helps when you pour the icing on. Roll out the marzipan in a super thin layer. Then place it on top of each section of layered cake. Add simple syrup first to help the marzipan stick. Trim off any marzipan that overlaps the cake sections. Wrap each section in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. The next day, cut the sections in small squares. Each three-layer cake section will give you 12 petit fours. And you can get at least 5 three-layer sections. That&#8217;s a lot of little cakes. (After the icing dried, I drizzled on some melted chocolate and added a few fondant flowers for decoration.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3759765813/" title="IMG_1253 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3465/3759765813_7261e428ce_o.jpg" alt="IMG_1253" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The next day, dip these in poured fondant and place on a wire rack. Set a cookie sheet underneath to catch the drippings.</p>
<p>What I used for the poured fondant = 2 lb bag (@7.5 cups) powdered sugar, 1/2 cup light corn syrup, 1/3 cup water, 1 tsp vanilla extract. Heat on low and stir until everything is completely combined.</p>
<p>Pouring didn&#8217;t work so much for me. I dipped each of the four sides and then spooned a little over the top. This was by far the trickiest part. Getting the consistency right, covering the cakes smoothly. I made a HUGE gigantic mess.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a peek…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3760566790/" title="IMG_1218 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3432/3760566790_23fd023132_o.jpg" alt="IMG_1218" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Again, I suggest visiting <a href="http://veganyumyum.com/2008/01/petits-fours/">veganyumyum</a> for a great how-to as I have no actual photos of the dipping, dripping, pouring or cursing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3760563874/" title="IMG_1223_2 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2463/3760563874_7537d18395_o.jpg" alt="IMG_1223_2" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I managed to get several out that looked pretty decent, though.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/3760566550/" title="IMG_1216 by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2629/3760566550_242e12e9cd_o.jpg" alt="IMG_1216" height="333" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>But by the end, I was out of icing, out of my mind and still had a bunch of uncovered little cakes. They stayed that way, too. I&#8217;ve convinced myself they taste better uncovered.</p>
<p>Petit fours. Been there. Done that.</p>

				<p>i saw on a site recently that when they made petit fours, instead of dipping them on all sides, the icing was thin enough to pour over the cakes (on a cookie sheet over a baking pan like you had them drip drying). not sure if it was a nontraditional icing and thats why it was pourable or what&#8230;if you do ever try them again, that might be an easier way to ice them, because yes, that is a serious pain.</p>

				<p>You always outdo yourself. YUM. And I love pound cake. I allow myself to gain a pound or so just to indulge in it&#39;s yumminess from time to time. </p>
<p>As for the petit fours&#8230; I&#39;ve always wanted to make them, but as you stated&#8230; Time consuming. Lots and lots of time consumed. But, man do they look gorgeous and delicious!</p>

				<p>I&#39;ve been enjoying your blog for a while now, but I think this is the first I&#39;ve commented.  Anyhow, I <i>adore</i> petit fours, but limit myself to one box per year bought from the Hickory Farms kiosk sometime in December.  I then make it last until well until January.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a reasonable cook, but can&#39;t bake to save my life.  I have to say, I can&#39;t <i>imagine</i> trying to make petit fours.  You have my everlasting admiration for even trying!</p>

				<p>Ooohhh, missed an opportunity to make trifle with the leftover un-iced cakes Bakerella!  Arrange in a layer, drizzle on a little sherry, a raspberry or strawberry layer, some custard sauce, repeat layers and top with stiffly whipped cream.  Decorate with some berries.  It does well to sit a day as long as you seal the whipped cream to the edge of the bowl and cover with saran directly on top.</p>

				<p>Well, THANK YOU! For all the stress, cursing and making of the pound cakes and petit fours. I think they are wonderful, and the best ones have to be the uncovered ones in the measuring bowl! I think i need to try your cream cheese pound cake for the next Bunco night. I know all the ladies will love it and if I make it to the farmer&#39;s market that week, I&#39;ll make a second one with strawberries! I&#39;ll let them all know that Bakerella taught me how!</p>

				<p>Petit fours&#8230; Beautiful! But I would agree that they taste better uncovered, and I&#39;m certain that larger pieces would taste equally wonderful! (there&#39;s no way I&#39;m making anything similar to them, ever)<br />But the pound cake&#8230; I&#39;m definitely making that one in the not-so-distant future! I hope it will look half as nice as yours does.</p>

				<p>Petit Fours are my favorite! They taste so good, look so pretty and are perfect for any kind of gathering. I used to make them all the time when I was a decorator (much easier in such a big space!) but have done them a few times at home. My tips for getting them really good:</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never done them with layers of jam like you did. I&#39;ve always had and seen them as a piece of cake with a thick layer of buttercream on top before the icing. So I&#39;d frost the level cake with buttercream and freeze it. Then you can cut perfect cubes with a ruler and a pizza cutter and it will keep sharp edges from being frozen. </p>
<p>The icing is the hardest part but once you get the consistency right, skewer from the bottom a piece of frozen cake and dip. Take it off the skewer with a fork and put it on a rack to drip like you did. NEVER pour the icing. It makes ugly  drips on the bottom and never looks as good (and a waste of icing!)</p>
<p>For all the cakepops you do, I&#39;d think this would have been a snap for you. I think your problem was the layering and filling which, for a cake that shape, is very difficult.</p>

				<p>Bakerella I just love your work and your ideas, I try my hand at your designs but they never come out as good as yours. I&#39;m currently working on a project that you inspired. Remember when you did the valentines day box out of cake and then had the cake bites in them. A friend of mine wants to do that for his wife&#39;s birthday, but using her initial &quot;J&quot; as the box and then putting the cake bites on top. Do you have any suggestions on how I can execute this to look nice.  Maybe make it look like she opened a box in the shape of a &quot;J&quot; and have the fondant zagged, liked ripped paper? What do you think?</p>

				<p>I use a &quot;cheat pound cake&quot; with my favorite yellow cake, 8 oz sour cream, 4eggs, 1/3 cup oil, 1 instant pudding mix and it comes out delicious and super sturdy for cakes with delicate details, carved cakes or cakes covered in fondant! This is the recipe I used when I made my first fondant cake, check it out;<br />Lauren<br /><a href="http://eatmytreats.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://eatmytreats.blogspot.com</a><br />I even made your burger sliders with the pound cake buns and while not as goodlooking as yours they came out pretty yummy</p>

				<p>Oh my goodness. I tried making petit fours the other day too! I&#39;m glad to see that I&#39;m not the only one that had trouble pouring the icing/pourable fondant on them! Mine looked disastrous, but they tasted delicious! :-) I felt like Bakerella last week because I made Harry Potter cupcakes, a giant mermaid birthday cake, cake pops, and petit fours! Only the Harry Potter cupcakes and the mermaid cake turned out well, though. Bakerella, you have inspired me to branch out and try new things when it comes to baking. Thank you so much!</p>

				<p>i&#39;m not going to lie, it&#39;s extremely comforting to see (and read!) that you have as much trouble with messiness sometimes as I do &#8212; my cake balls often end up looking like that, with everything dripping everywhere!</p>

				<p>Those look pretty tasty.  </p>
<p>I made petit fours ages and ages ago, but I cannot remember for the life of me how I actually did them.  I don&#39;t believe mine were layered (I am almost positive that I used instructions from one of the Betty Crocker glossies from the checkout lane), but they were still tasty.</p>

				<p>Pound Cake &#8211; Yum!  One of the best ways to eat it is broil it for 5 minutes or so and it will brown a little.  Top with fruit, ice cream, chocolate sauce&#8230;or whatever most interests you!!!  Yum!!!</p>
