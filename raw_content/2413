<p><b><i><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+2>Sometimes It is Hard to Improve
on a Good Thing.</font></font></i></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't get me wrong - I like
innovation. The fact that there is a new computer out every year that is
50% more powerful than the previous model excites me to no end. Why? Because
it means I'll be able to view porno at a much higher resolution. And, let's
face it, the more cable channels we can shove through a line, the more
chance there is that we'll actually find something to watch on the boob
tube more than 10% of the time (so many channels, so little interesting
on). Technology is a good thing! :)</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then there are those
rare creations that NEVER change, and for good reason - they are all but
perfect. Nails, for instance, are pretty much the same now as they were
50 or even 100 years ago. Mouse traps that were used in the 1940's are
almost identical to most of the ones made in 2000. And though a Ginsu knife
can cut through a lead pipe, it still shares the same basic design as the
steak knives our grandparents used. Innovation may be everywhere, but it
is obvious that there are some ideas it hasn't touched in a LONG time.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No where is this more apparent
than in the areas of food and drink. Below are five of the most interesting
foods and drinks we could find - all of which have remained nearly untouched
by the passing of time. Take a look, and see what Father Time has been
hoarding in his pantry over the years...</font></b>

<p><b><i><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+2>Marshmallow Peeps: Sugar-Filled
Easter Goodness!</font></font></i></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you get when you
combine marshmallows with the impressionist movement? Marshmallow Peeps!
These little gobs of sugar and goo have been made by the Just Born, Inc.
company since 1953 when they acquired the Rodda Candy Company of Lancaster,
Pennsylvania. Though the process has been automated and new colors have
appeared, the peeps themselves remain almost identical to the originals.
Your grandparents (and potentially your grandchildren) could easily have
enjoyed the same candy-filled fun that you do today!</font></b>
<center>
<p><img SRC="peepsno.gif" height=151 width=418>
<br><font color="#33FF33">Notice the amazing similarities between "modern"
peeps and the originals?</font></center>

<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><i><font color="#FFCC00">Fun
Facts:</font></i><font color="#FFFFFF"> Each individual Peep has 32 calories
and 0 grams of fat. Some people like to eat them on pizza, especially "Hawaiian
style" variants. Personally, I like to put them on sticks and watch them
burst into flame over a camp fire.</font></b>

<p><b><i><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+2>Turkey Legs: The Favored Scepter
of Kings!</font></font></i></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanksgiving meals in my
family were always the same when I was growing up. My mom, dad, uncles,
aunts, and cousins would all gather at my grandparents' house for a nice
meal - one that featured a turkey. The problem, of course, was that all
of the little cousins WANTED THE TURKEY DRUMSTICKS, and there were only
two. Wrestling and other forms of combat quickly ensued, and the last two
standing would get the fabled food. The adults, of course, were forced
to settle for the white meat. Stupid grown-ups! Could you pretend to be
the King of England and then bash someone in the head with a turkey breast?
I think NOT! Turkey legs are the ONLY way to go.</font></b>
<center>
<p><img SRC="tturkey1.jpg" height=302 width=410>
<br><font color="#33FF33">Two very different people enjoy turkey legs.</font></center>

<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turkey legs (aka drumsticks)
have been made in roughly the same way for millennia. Though a few basic
spices might be added (or, in the case of the photo above, barbecue sauce),
the turkey leg itself and how it is eaten remain almost the same. The eating
process is simple: 1) Grab the exposed bone, 2) bite off a huge chunk of
meat, 3) chew, 4) swallow, 5) repeat until there is no meat left. Simple..
and strangely effective.</font></b>

a large drumstick in one hand. Apparently, forming new religions and beheading
wives makes a person EXTREMELY hungry.</font></center>

<font color="#33FF33">&nbsp;</font><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; </font><i><font color="#FFCC00">Fun
Facts:</font></i><font color="#FFFFFF"> During the Thanksgiving of 2000,
Butterball.com was knocked off of the internet numerous times by excessive
traffic (too many people wanted directions on how to cook a turkey!). One
of the favorite foods at renaissance festivals are large turkey drumsticks
marketed as "official" renaissance food.</font></b>

<p><b><i><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+2>Fruitcakes: The Gift That
Keeps On Being Given.</font></font></i></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone has heard the urban
legend about the fruitcake that was passed from one person to the next
for years until, one Christmas a decade later, it returned to the original
giver. I don't know if this is true or not, but I DO have my own legend:
Every year, I receive a fruitcake from someone. Every year, I put it in
the freezer to keep. I now have 6 fruitcakes. When I have ten, I intend
to build a tiny walkway across my gravel driveway so I don't get my feet
wet when it rains. I know that's not particularly ironic, but it does illustrate
my point: fruitcakes are NASTY.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people said I shouldn't
include fruitcakes on this list - either because they didn't like them
or because they thought there were too many different varieties. I say,
"Bah!" To the majority of Americans, a fruitcake is a fruitcake is a fruitcake..
and they all taste the same. I call THAT timeless, so they get added to
the list.</font></b>

<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i><font color="#FFCC00">Fun Facts: </font></i><font color="#FFFFFF">I
don't know any fun facts about fruitcake except that most are made with
brandy. Personally, I think their are better uses for that liquid than
dumping it into one of these abominations.</font></b>

<p><b><i><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+2>Mead: Elixir of the Ancients.</font></font></i></b>
<p>&nbsp;<b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp; The TRUE drink of vikings,
kings, and renaissance enthusiasts, mead has been around for a long time.
It is older than beer, older than ale, and even older than grape wine.
It is considered one of the first alcoholic beverages ever invented, and
keeps the same basic formula of honey, water, and yeast to this day. Try
a bottle today!</font></b>

<p><br><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></font><b><i><font color="#FFCC00">Fun
Facts:</font></i><font color="#FFFFFF"> The term "honeymoon" actually involves
mead! Back in the old days, a newlywed couple were given a moon's supply
of mead in order to help ensure pregnancy. Mead was also thought to have
medicinal properties, especially the spiced "metheglin" variant.</font></b>

<hr WIDTH="90%">
<p><b><i><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+2>Hardtack: The Real Reason
the Civil War Ended.</font></font></i></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last (but certain not least)
comes one of our favorites: Hardtack! These "crackers" are made from wheat
flour and water. That's it. No salt, butter, egg, or anything else.. just
wheat flour and water.&nbsp; What can I say? The classics never die!</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best thing about hardtack
(besides its shelf life) is the fact that it is FILLING. A hardtack cracker
will literally sit in your stomach like a brick, making you feel full.
They may not taste like anything while you eat them, but these crackers
FEEL like you've eaten a hundred of them once they go down. I like to eat
one after getting Chinese to ensure that I don't feel hungry an hour later..
but that's just me.</font></b>
<center>
<p><img SRC="hardtpl.jpg" height=368 width=390>
<br><font color="#33FF33">A hardtack cracker sits out on an antique plate.
Which do you think is older?</font></center>

<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><i><font color="#FFCC00">Fun
Facts:</font></i><font color="#FFFFFF"> Hardtack crackers are best known
for the role they played in the Civil War. They were one of the main sources
of food for soldiers in the field, though few fighting men actually liked
the flavor. Civil War reenactors commonly purchase hardtack and unroasted
coffee in order to get an "authentic" experience.</font></b>

<hr WIDTH="90%">
<p><b><i><font color="#33FF33"><font size=+2>So Now That You Know...</font></font></i></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><font color="#FFFFFF">Why not give these
delicacies a try if you haven't already? Besides the enjoyment you might
get out of having a new taste experience, there's knowing that you'll be
experiencing the same aromas and flavors that members of numerous other
generations tried as well. Take a step back in time, and see what a LACK
of innovation can be like for a change.</font></b>
