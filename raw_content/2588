      <p class="date"><small>February 5, 2013 by admin</small></p>
	
      <div class="post">
      
	  <div id="article-content">
<p>Harvey Mackay, who wrote in a syndicated column for United Features stated, &#8220;People begin to become successful the minute they decide to be&#8221;.</p>
<p>Those words ring so true for the Internet Marketer. As we battle daily the desire to create the lives of our dreams; writing ads, articles, blogs, press releases, etc. to convince others that the opportunity we present is wonderful. But in the early phases where generating traffic to these campaigns seems bleak, we wane in our confidence necessary to keep going.</p>
<p>So I ask again, Motivation &#8211; What Works For You?</p>
<p>Your motivation must be well defined, available immediately for review and mental action, so as not to be tripped up by missteps. Each task we accomplish does not necessarily reduce the horizon behind us. These however can provide education for later steps. To learn and understand the process helps to increase our future success. Not all of us will have the &#8216;luck&#8217; that some do with their ad campaigns. The chance that our words are acted on right away and a sale is made is only a promise of all the &#8216;gurus&#8217; out their selling the next &#8220;best system on the internet today&#8221;.</p>
<p>For the vast majority, these numbers come along slowly. Potential purchasers on the web are out their. It is just not every day that they visit our scribblings. Constantly trying combinations of words in these campaigns that will eventually bring them our way is an arduous task. Those not getting sales may have given up too soon, or just never had the deep desire. Most information seekers ( these are what I believe are on the net ) are not &#8220;Wowed&#8221; the instant your campaigns are seen. However, there can be an attitude within your writing; combining words in ways that can be remembered.</p>
<p>In the book &#8216;Positive Thinking Every Day&#8217; written by Norman Vincent Peale, he stated, &#8220;In every difficult situation is potential value. Believe this, then begin looking for it.&#8221;&nbsp; The value of the thought, to beginning each morning with the idea that today&#8217;s actions will be the ones that work, must not leave your mind. Just as stated earlier, you really must believe that you will be successful while you are working to be. We are told many times to see our ultimate dream; see it daily to remind our minds why. Without it, what path should be taken when several choices are presented, becomes arduous to choose? And no action is then taken.</p>
<p>So I ask again, Motivation &#8211; What Works For You?</p>
<p>Define them, what ever they may be, and make them a habit. You will see over time, those habits become natural, without thought, and your creative side will come forth. For no person was the best immediately. Your actions will define you. I will leave you with this final quote from Steven Covey from his book, &#8216;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Between stimulus and response, one has the freedom to choose.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is yours to choose, yours to embrace, yours to overcome. Success happens out there, not from behind the windows.</p>

      <p class="date"><small>February 2, 2013 by admin</small></p>
	
      <div class="post">
      
	  <div id="article-content">
<p>What have you always wanted to do but thought &#8220;I could never do that&#8221;? In your wildest dreams what would it be?</p>
<p>Sky diving&#8230;skinny dipping&#8230;mountain climbing&#8230;?</p>
<p>What would it take for you to actually DO it?</p>
<p>Be dared&#8230;get drunk&#8230;?</p>
<p>What if you just <em>decided </em>to do it? What would that look like? Many people who are diagnosed with Cancer start to live their dreams <em>after</em> they were diagnosed. Living your dreams puts you in a positive vibration which allows you to attract more positive things to you. It is the Law of Attraction: What you think about comes to you.</p>
<p>Now, you can&#8217;t have any of those nasty negative thoughts or self-talk sneak in there, it all has to be positive. The best way to keep the vibration is to imagine that you already have it.</p>
<p>Remember using your imagination when you were a kid? Well, dig it up again if it has been a long time since you have used it.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought &#8220;what if you died with the music still in you&#8221;? Think for a minute with your eyes closed. If you had 4 weeks to live, how would you plan your day&#8230;your nights&#8230;your weekends&#8230;? Who would you be talking with? Where would you go?</p>
<p>Here are some things to think about to get in touch with your wild side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a list of things you always thought about doing. Prioritize it without picking up the pen (The crazier the better)</li>
<li>Add to it who you might do it with if applicable</li>
<li>Check your bank account and holdings. Don&#8217;t bite off more than you can chew</li>
<li>Surf the web for groups/associations doing what is on your list</li>
<li>Contact your friends and tell them your interests. Find a buddy to do it with or not!</li>
<li>Set a date on your calendar to call the contact person or travel agent. Write it in your planner and assign a time to do it &#8211; then call!</li>
<li>Reward yourself with something fabulous for taking the risk. Write about it in your journal</li>
</ul>
<p>Think what kind of wonderful contribution you will have to your family, colleagues, community, and the world when you get in touch with who you really are.</p>
<p>Start attracting what you really want. Live your wildest dreams. Dare to be the real YOU!</p>

<p>The imagination is an amazing tool that the mind utilizes to paint a visual picture of what&#8217;s hidden inside of the heart. To imagine what it would be like to be exactly where you want to be in life is something that even the greatest amongst us has done from time to time, and in fact, it&#8217;s probably what motivated them to be where they are right now. The imagination has the ability to take us anywhere we want to go, however; when what we see when we open up our eyes in reality totally differs from what we imagined, how can one stay motivated?</p>
<p>Reality can be a tricky place to live in depending on the foundation its build upon. Reality has the ability to exclude some things from the eyes of a dreamer that would cause them to believe that a dream is just a dream. The conditions of the world, the seemingly impossible price tag that&#8217;s attached to what we want, and the &#8220;negative supporters&#8221;, all play their part in the devouring of dreams. When you begin to pull out your list of downfalls and rejections, it becomes very easy to believe that maybe what you want is not meant to be, and the fact that so many other people around you appear to be living out your dreams does nothing but confirm those negative feelings that you have instead of inspiring you to believe that if it can happen for them then it can happen for you. A lot of us have had to endure the hard task of developing our own reality in order to survive. It&#8217;s a reality that insists on moving forward and refusing the alternative. In this reality we find our motivation and we become firm believers in the fact that there is enough of God&#8217;s love and provision to go around and there is no fear of it running out!</p>
<p>Do not give fear and negativity the opportunity to cause a forfeit in your crusade for purpose.</p>
<p>When you have a dream, it almost seems as though mistakes, doubt, fear, and everything else negative under the sun is drawn to it just like a magnet. You find yourself fighting for, defending and pleading with the very things you once felt so passionate about until you get so tired that you decide to take a time out. It is during this &#8220;time out&#8221; that distractions come and cause you to forfeit everything except for the memories of what could have been because life likes to save those for later to taunt you with, just when you thought you couldn&#8217;t feel any lower. You have to get to a point where the discovery of your destiny means so much to you that you are not willing to trade it in for defeat. To give up on your contribution to the world is not an option. To live stagnant in the midst of change is removed from your state of mind from this point on!</p>
<p>Take your dreams back!</p>
<p>Sometimes a person can feel that because they have reached a certain age or made numerous mistakes in life that it is too late for dreams. Sometimes life has a very cunning way of making you believe that it is just simply not going to happen, however; I challenge you to believe that you can achieve whatever you believe in! Matthew 9:29 Then touched he their eyes, saying, according to your faith be it unto you. The things you are in search of are reliant upon your faith. It is the avenue of your faith that your dreams are allowed to travel through. Your faith is the road map and if you do not provide your dreams with the directions then they will never find you. It is up to you to take your dreams back by claiming them and providing an atmosphere in which they can live and survive in. Though many dreams are commonly desired, those that belong to you have your name on them, and are for you only, so do not let the success of others around you make you shrink back from the possibility of your own. Learn to develop an attitude that says I&#8217;d rather try and fail then to not try at all because to play the, should&#8217;ve, could&#8217;ve game is bad for your spiritual and mental health!</p>
<p>A dream (meaning a goal or a vision) is not simply just a dream but it is a mental revelation to the purpose of your life on this earth and it can sometimes become reoccurring, almost like a warning until you do something about it. It is the one thing that stays in your heart and in your memories even when everything and everyone else has left you. The imagination is a gift from God that allows you to see as much as your heart is willing to expose to you and after that, God will go above and beyond that, simply because you dared to believe that in the midst of adversity that he could still do anything. Can you imagine that?</p>

      <p class="date"><small>January 28, 2013 by admin</small></p>
	
      <div class="post">

<p>If you have ever listened to a motivating speaker, then you already know the skills they possess to reach an audience and get results. People that have become disabled due to unforeseen circumstances battle all sorts of demons. Their life is often changed forever and it can be hard for them to see the positive parts of their life. You may work, go to school with, or even see someone disabled and wonder how they get through each day and maintain their positive attitude. It is almost guaranteed that they at one point struggled with their situation and felt like giving up. People in bad situations often need a little motivation to overcome their struggles. There is no better person to speak to an audience and encourage them to continue trying than a disabled motivational speaker. They have the most inspiring story of any speaker available and their courage to continue even in the most trying of times is very moving. A disabled motivational speaker can give others the strength they need to continue trying and reach their goals.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do So Many Businesses and Groups Choose To Employ a Motivational Speaker?</strong></p>
<p>A motivational speaker can give audience members the strength and encouragement they may have not had themselves. Everyone wants to do better, accomplish specific goals, and get fulfillment in their lives. For many, it is having the strength to start and finish these dreams that is lacking. An inspiring story of achievement from someone who has been disabled or been through challenging times can really change a person&#8217;s view of their own life and situation. Sometimes this is all that is needed to get them moving in a positive direction once again. A motivational speaker can develop positive work attitudes, encourage teamwork, and help audience members reach the goals they have strived to achieve for so long. Motivation is a very powerful tool that can accomplish so much. When you want the audience to respond and do something, a motivating speaker is the only way to go.</p>
<p><strong>Business Speakers Can Be Motivational</strong></p>
<p>Companies needing professionals to speak at events normally hire business speakers. They want someone that is knowledgeable about a specific subject and has the professional stature to gain the audience&#8217;s attention. Business speakers can be experts and motivational at the same time. These speakers relate better to the audience and in most cases, get more involvement during their presentation. A motivating speaker can take a topic that would normally sound like a lecture and make it more about self improvement and personal growth. A serious lecture may have a very negative affect. When you use someone that has an inspiring story or exceptional motivational skills, the topic is not focused on pointing out faults but instead encouraging the audience to improve their skills and abilities. This kind of motivation has been proven to have the best results for business and life situations. Instead of drilling the facts into someone&#8217;s head and telling them they have to do something, take a new approach and encourage them to do it for themselves and a better life.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to be successful. I never heard anyone say they don&#8217;t have a dream&#8230; All of us have dreams. It can be an ultimate dream or just a goal you want to accomplish in a particular area. Achieving success in life can be fulfilling; it can make you stronger, smarter and experienced. In short it can lead to a better life, a better self and a better sense of individuality. But how do you get the right life motivation?</p>
<p>The road to success can be rough at times; it can be tricky too. That is why most people find themselves lost in the way. A lot of people end up unfulfilled, frustrated and very much discouraged. Why? Well maybe because they don&#8217;t have the right life motivation to get them to the end of their journey. Much worse is, when they reach the end of their road, they won&#8217;t find what they are truly looking for.</p>
<p>So ask yourself, what is it that you have to know to reach true success in life? What will keep you moving forward? Well read on and discover the answers for yourself.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Determine your True Goal. </strong>You should always have a CLEAR vision in life. Knowing what you really want to do and what you want to become are very significant in reaching your dreams. Setting a goal you truly desire and knowing what this goal means to you as a whole, will give you the perfect life motivation and give you a great start.  A lot of people get greatly misguided in this part. You have to keep in mind that your goal should be something that you TRULY and DEEPLY want. Sometimes, people end up doing something that they HAVE to do rather than doing what they WANT to do. That can make you unfulfilled and lost. Sometimes it can also ruin your inspiration and determination. You might end up discouraged at the very first failure you encounter because you don&#8217;t have the RIGHT REASONS to get you motivated enough to keep you going. Remember you wouldn&#8217;t want to live a life that you don&#8217;t really dream of. You don&#8217;t want to pursue another person&#8217;s dream. </li>
<li> <strong>Motivation is the key to Success.</strong> There is a saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s no harm in trying&#8221;. Well, overused it may be, but the idea is still the same and very true. You should always think of the reasons behind your goal. Why shouldn&#8217;t you give up? Establish your purpose and weigh everything. You need to find out why your dream is worth risking for&#8230;Why it is worth all your hard work and efforts. When you determine this, you will see, failing twice or more will not stop you from chasing after your dream. By keeping this in mind, you&#8217;ll have enough life motivation to last you a lifetime. One other key to get the right life motivation is to always THINK POSITIVE. Having the correct mindset will enable you to overcome even the most difficult obstacle in your way. You should learn to look at the brighter side of life. You should not let any failure stops you from moving on. Remember, positive attitude derives best results. Act positively and everything will fall into place.  </li>
<li> <strong>Exert Yourself to the Fullest. </strong> Everything will be put in vain if we don&#8217;t work hard. You don&#8217;t get anything in this world for free. Most especially when we talk about success. When you achieve the right life motivation, this means you can live to your fullest potential. Give it your best shot. You need to strive hard; invest time and effort. In the end you will see, it is all for the best of your interest. </li>
</ul>
<p>Just remember this when you feel like you are close to giving up: &#8220;At the end of our journey, it won&#8217;t matter how many times we tried or how many times we fail, what matters most is we learn..we grow and we succeed.&#8221; Besides, if you don&#8217;t stand up again, you won&#8217;t be anywhere you want to be. So might as well take the risk and face challenges with courage, determination and the right life motivation.

<p>Many of us go through life as if we are just waiting for the next big thing: we want to win the lottery, we want more time, we want more money, we want a new car. It seems we are not happy with our life as it is right now, in this moment. And as such, we end up wishing our entire life away. Before you know it, we are 65 years old and wishing we had done more to enjoy our earlier years!</p>
<p>There is a way you can enjoy the life you have right now, while at the same time working to create the dream life that you want for yourself and your family. Use the power of motivational quotes to propel you towards creating a better life.</p>
<p>Empower Yourself!<br />
Motivational quotes can empower you to take action and design the lifestyle that you want for yourself. They can help you think about what it would be like to live in that big house, or drive that great car, or take that exotic vacation. They can help you to understand that you are as able as anyone else to have the finer things in life. The only thing limiting you is your mindset.</p>
<p>Motivational Quotes:<br />
The best way to start your path to greatness is to read a motivational quote every single day. The best time is first thing in the morning, before you have read the newspaper or listened to the morning news. Write the quote in a journal and reflect on it &#8211; write your own notes about what it means to you, and how you can implement it in your everyday routine. Cut out some magazine pictures, or create your own. Make the journal as personal as you can. It will become your road map to success.</p>
<p>It will also help to learn about the authors of your favorite quotes. Do some research and find out how they achieved their success. Visit their websites, and purchase their books, or borrow them from your local library. This will help to deepen your motivation and understand how they overcame their own adversities. It&#8217;s like having your own personal mentor with you 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>Getting into the habit of reading daily motivational quotes can be a huge boost to getting you on the path to a greater, happier life. It puts you in a positive frame of mind, and you will be more apt to create an action plan for your life and take the necessary steps to achieve the results you desire.</p>

      <p class="date"><small>January 19, 2013 by admin</small></p>
	
      <div class="post">
      
	  <div id="article-content">
<p>Marijuana is among many one of the triggers of depersonalization. The change in how you perceive the world is not due to something being wrong with your eyes, it is due to the underlying anxiety. The constant irrational fear you experience is called anxiety and it can manifest itself in many forms both physical (neck pain, migraine, shallow breathing&#8230;) and psychological (fear, depersonalization, loss of focus, loss of motivation&#8230;). Therefore in order to eliminate the feelings of unreality you will have to start controlling and coping with the underlying anxiety.</p>
<p>Once it is triggered there is no undo button to make you feel normal again, the true treatment is patience, but there are many steps to follow and methods which have the tendency to speed up the recovery by several months, such as:</p>
<p><b>1. Avoid substances that prolong recovery</b> &#8211; these include alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and psychoactive drugs (magic mushrooms, MDMA, cannabis&#8230;) as further use of these will only intensify your anxiety.</p>
<p><b>2. Start a healthy diet</b> &#8211; avoiding sugars and eating in a healthier fashion will take some weight of your anxiety. Your body is currently hypersensitive to various chemical substances. Eating sugar makes you more energetic and you do not want that when dealing with strong anxiety. Drinking water instead of flavored drinks is a good start.</p>
<p><b>3. Exercise</b> &#8211; physical activity promotes the secretion of endorphins and other mood-stabilizing hormones. Start jogging, biking or anything else you like and see for yourself how well it works.</p>
<p><b>4. Find the sources of your anxiety and face them!</b> &#8211; I consider this the most important step in overcoming depersonalization as by identifying your sources of anxiety can help you deal with it and eventually defeat it. There are many great web-pages and books that will help you with proper identifying of the sources of your anxiety and then teach you to eliminate those negative thoughts.</p>
<p>It took me 10 months in total to overcome these feelings of depersonalization, but as I started following the above mentioned tips the recovery sped up tremendously. Do not give up upon yourself, look forward to the better times as they will come sooner or later. Try to keep a positive attitude and be optimistic, a strong will can do wonders. So try various methods and see which ones are for you the best and eventually you will recover as most cases do!</p>

      <div class="post">

<p>Danielle is gifted with artistic hands that could put Picasso and Da Vinci at bay. Her paintings are full of life and are all original masterpieces. Ever since she was a child, Danielle had dreamed of becoming a painter and owning an art studio &#8211; a dream that had nothing to do with the law firm that her family ran.</p>
<p>Today Danielle is a zombie working for her family&#8217;s law firm. Although she has good job performance, she just can&#8217;t put her heart and soul in it. She took up law after college because her father encouraged her to take a more &#8216;sensible&#8217; path. The field demanded much of her time that she stopped painting, stopped practicing her art and stopped living her dream.</p>
<p>As Danielle&#8217;s best friend, I couldn&#8217;t bear to see her watch her life pass her by. I knew that I had to do something. I had to remind her of how different she was before. Then, she was teeming with life and pulsating with motivation. Now, she is as animated as a brick. I had to motivate her once more. While cooking up ideas on how to help Danielle, I remembered that Montaigne once said &#8216;The pleasant things in the world are pleasant thoughts: and the great art of life is to have as many of them as possible.&#8217; So I bought my friend a book compilation on motivational thoughts. Here are some examples of the motivational thoughts contained in the book:</p>
<p>o &#8220;It&#8217;s YOUR Life, Live BIG.&#8221; &#8211; Josh Hind. If you want to eventually succeed, you need to do things that would move you closer to it. You just can&#8217;t dilly-dally and drag your feet around. However, if your dream is consists entirely of watching TV for hours on end, then by all means, drag your feet as much as you can.</p>
<p>o There is no elevator to success. You have to take the stairs. You&#8217;re a service company with a single employee! Being in autopilot will lead you no where near success. Who is responsible for your success? Look in the mirror. Don&#8217;t settle on being a follower-be a lifelong learner and leader.</p>
<p>o &#8220;In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.&#8221; &#8211; Albert Einstein. Tomas Alva Edison made 10, 000 wrong choices in the process of making the incandescent bulb. His only reply was that he now knew ten thousand ways by which it cannot be done.</p>
<p>o &#8220;We don&#8217;t grow unless we take risks. Any successful company is riddled with failures.&#8221; &#8211; James E. How will you know if you will pass a class in physics if you don&#8217;t even take it? It is always better to try and fail than to live a lifetime of regret knowing that you had the chance to succeed.</p>
<p>o &#8220;To be successful, you must decide exactly what you want to accomplish then resolve to pay the price to get it.&#8221; &#8211; Bunker Hunt. Success is earned. It is not like manna that will simply fall down from heaven. Decide what you want then work for it no matter how many boulders block your path.</p>
<p>o &#8220;Life is like a bicycle.&#8221; &#8211; villagehero.com. The moment you stop pedaling, you start losing momentum. If you coast for too long, you fall. If your goal is something worth pursuing, do something to move you closer to it.</p>
<p>o &#8220;This above all, to thine own self be true.&#8221; &#8211; Shakespeare. What&#8217;s the point of being someone you&#8217;re not? Will you forever wear that mask? Because it IS tiring-and sooner or later you&#8217;ll have to take it off.</p>
<p>o &#8220;Grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the Courage to change the things I can, and the Wisdom to know the difference.&#8221; &#8211; The Serenity Prayer. Change is the only thing permanent. You have to learn to accept it. Not living your dream right at this moment doesn&#8217;t automatically mean that you will forever not be able to reach it, because if you really want to live your dream, you will find a way to do so.</p>
<p>I am sure that Danielle found the book that I gave her beneficial because when I visited her yesterday, she looked happier. Perhaps you are also in need of motivation. Well, I am positive that the above motivational thoughts could also help you. But you have to remember that these motivational thoughts will remain nothing but words unless you make them your own. They are there to guide your actions, not to make the actions happen. They can help mold your attitude but they cannot do the whole thing for you. They can influence you to change your perspective but they cannot maintain that perspective for you. You are the one responsible for the action. Napoleon Hill said &#8220;Man, alone, has the power to transform his thoughts into physical reality; man alone, can dream and make his dreams come true&#8217;.</p>

      <h2 class="postTitle"><a href="http://dreampositive.info/" rel="bookmark">Using Goals to Achieve Your Dreams</a></h2>
      
      <p class="date"><small>January 15, 2013 by admin</small></p>
	
      <div class="post">
      
	  <div id="article-content">
<p>The terms &#8216;goal&#8217; and &#8216;dream&#8217; are often misunderstood. People, often without realising the difference, use them interchangeably as if they mean the same. They are not. Dreams could be defined as the desired destination, while goals are the means by which the dreams become a reality. Having a clear understanding of what your dreams are compared to your goals is a key to genuine fulfilment in life.</p>
<p>As humans, we have all been granted the innate ability to dream. We are born dreamers and it forms an important part of who we are. Perhaps even more importantly, within us we all have the cognitiveability to establish achievable goals to live out those dreams. These are the chosen steps, directions and strategies that will lead you to your destination.</p>
<p>Dreams live within us all. Some are close to the surface, alive and perhaps even being realised. Others have tended to be buried, either because of our lack of confidence to fulfil them or from others telling us they are foolish or unrealistic. To really know what your innermost desires are, you need to take time to reflect quietly and listen to yourself. Hear what your heart is saying.</p>
<p>Dreams are divine inspirations conceived in our imagination. They are the co-creation of your own ingenuity. Sadly though, many of these dreams are never considered worthy of our effort to realise them. If a dream is conceived but never believed it is considered merely a fantasy. Often our lives are restricted to these fleeting fantasies because we don&#8217;t have the courage to embrace our dreams.</p>
<p>However, those that we appreciate, believe in and nurture are given the opportunity to flourish. When they are defined and clarified they provide you with foresight and become an expression of life itself. There is a famous quote from James Allen that reads &#8220;Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so you shall become&#8230;&#8221; In other words, it doesn&#8217;t matter what your dream may be because all things are possible!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let yourself be restricted by perceived impossibilities. Focus instead on what you behold and nourish those inspirations within you. Give fantasies the chance to become something much greater. It&#8217;s then that you will be able to create self-fulfilment and display to the world your creations. So, dream as you wish and keep your focus on this desired destination. It&#8217;s when you do this that you begin to locate solutions for your journey. Dreams are fully manifested by setting goals.</p>
<p>Focus on the end rather than the means. If dreams speak of the desired end product, goals are a means to achieve it. Fulfilling goals on the way to your dream destination provide you with great encouragement, momentum and feedback on your internal focus. They are stepping stones which enable you to see progress and reassess how far you are from ultimate success.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at a practical example of how this works. If you are overweight, let your dream be to live a long and healthy life. In other words, your dream is not to lose weight. Your dream is to achieve your ideal body weight so you can feel fit and healthy in later years. Losing weight is the goal to achieve the dream. Exactly the same philosophy can be applied to quitting a bad habit such as smoking or alcohol.</p>
<p>Many people experience perceived failure and lack of fulfilment because they focus on short-term goals instead of their dream destination. It is vital that you keep an eye on the prize, so to speak. While achieving goals offers a sense of satisfaction, this doesn&#8217;t provide ongoing motivation. Their real power comes from their connection to an inspiring dream. Focusing too much on the steps you are taking means that you risk losing sight of your destination, which is the reason why you are actually pursuing the goals in the first place.</p>
<p>So, how do we transform dreams into reality?</p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Listen to your heart, define your dream and develop a clear picture of your destination.</li>
<li>Take time to nurture the dream. Focus on it through contemplation and imagination. Don&#8217;t become concerned about the methodology because that will lead to doubt, lower your aspirations and weaken the vision of your destination</li>
<li>Reaffirm the dream aloud to yourself. State it positively, as if it has already been realised.</li>
<li>Visualise yourself reaching your dream destination. Imagine how it feels; try to sense the looks, sounds, tastes and smells.</li>
<li>Identify the goals that are revealed to you through the process. These are the powerful steps of action that will turn your dream into reality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s relate these steps to another real-life example:</p>
<p>If you dream is to create wealth, be specific about how much money you would like to earn. Imagine checking your bank account and seeing that amount of money there waiting for you. Positively reaffirm the dream to yourself, without being preoccupied about how it will happen. Perhaps most importantly, dream about the dream. Envisage the lifestyle that you will enjoy when you&#8217;ve reached your destination. Imagine and focus on all the things you&#8217;ll be able to do for yourself and your family.</p>
<p>Finally, set yourself short-term goals that will lead to your objective. There are two keys in setting goals &#8211; they should be achievable and within a certain period of time. Setting smaller, more attainable goals will develop a sense of accomplishment that will ultimately keep you focused on the dream itself.</p>
<p>This article isn&#8217;t meant as guide to creating wealth though. I simply want to inspire you to believe in your ability to dream and actually make them come true. Life is too short to not pursue your dreams. When we&#8217;re older we&#8217;ll either reflect on things with joy or regret. As Mark Twain once famously said &#8220;Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn&#8217;t do than by the ones you did do&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Always remember that dreams are born from the heart. They are creations that are unique to you and who you are gifted to become. Those who dream and, more importantly, set goals to achieve them, are the ones who experience joy in their lives and a sense of peace in their twilight years. They have lived with pride and finished well, for themselves and for their families.</p>
<p>Set your heart free to soar and take flight on the wings of your dreams. Nothing is impossible to him who knows his dream to be true. I hope this has been enlightening and inspiring to you.</p>
