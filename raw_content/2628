But, if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create money.<br /><b>--Sir Josiah Stamp, Director of the Bank of England (appointed 1928) and reputed to be the 2nd wealthiest man in England at that time</b>",

"I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world. No longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.<br /><b>--Woodrow Wilson</b>",
"Any fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage - to move in the opposite direction.<br /> <br /><b>--Albert Einstein</b>",

"By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.<br /><b>--John Maynard Keynes</b>",
"War is peace.<br />Freedom is slavery.<br />Ignorance is strength.<br /><b>--George Orwell </b>",
"Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.<br /><br /><br /><b>--Carl Jung</b>",
"The threat of environmental crisis is the 'international disaster key' to unlock the New World Order.<br /><br /><b>--Mikhail Gorbachev </b>",

"I have a right to nothing which another has a right to take away.<br /><b>--Thomas Jefferson</b>",
"Capital must protect itself in every way... Debts must be collected and loans and mortgages foreclosed as soon as possible. When through a process of law the common people have lost their homes, they will be more tractable and more easily governed by the strong arm of the law applied by the central power of leading financiers. People without homes will not quarrel with their leaders. This is well known among our principle men now engaged in forming an imperialism of capitalism to govern the world.

"The soul never thinks without a picture.<br /><br /><br /><b>--Aristotle</b>",

"Stop throwing the Constitution in my face. It’s just a goddamned piece of paper!<br /><b>--G.W.Bush</b>",
"A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.<br /><b>--Marcus Tullius Cicero</b>",
"It is enough that the people know there was an election. The people who cast the votes decide nothing. The people who count the votes decide everything.<br /><br /><b>--Joseph Stalin </b>",

"It is not worth an intelligent man's time to be in the majority. By definition, there are already enough people to do that.<br /><br /><b>--G. H. Hardy</b>",
"Whenever the economic life of a nation becomes pre¬carious, the central government is forced to assume additional responsibilities for the general welfare.  It must work out elaborate plans for dealing with a criti-cal situation; it must impose ever greater restrictions upon the activities of its subjects; and if, as is very likely, worsening economic conditions result in polit¬ical unrest, or open rebellion, the central government must intervene to preserve public order and its own authority. More and more power is thus concentrated in the hands of the executives and their bureaucratic managers. But the nature of power is such that even those who have not sought it, but have had it forced upon them, tend to acquire a taste for more. “Lead us not into temptation,” we pray — and with good reason; for when human beings are tempted too enticingly or too long, they generally yield. A democratic constitu¬tion is a device for preventing the local rulers from yielding to those particularly dangerous temptations that arise when too much power is concentrated in too few hands.<br />    <br /><b>--Aldus Huxley, Brave New World Revisited</b>",
"Let the beauty of what you love be what you do.<br /><br /><b>--Rumi </b>",
"Change you can believe in?<br />More like bullshit you can take a bath in, if you ask me.<br /><b>-- Prof. Dr. David Michael Green (Dec.19, 2009)</b>",

"If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.<br /><br /><b>--Wayne Dyer</b>",
"The individual is handicapped by coming face-to-face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists.<br /><br /><b>--J. Edgar Hoover, ex-FBI director on the New World Order conspiracy</b>",
"A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual doom.<br /><br /><b>--Martin Luther King, Jr.</b>",

"We\'ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false. <br /><b>--William Casey, CIA Director (from first staff meeting, 1981)</b>",
"Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things that escape those who dream only at night.<br /><br /><br /><b>--Edgar Allan Poe</b>",
"Disbelief in magic can force a poor soul into believing in government and business.<br />   <br /><b>--Tom Robbins</b>",
"No more illegal wiretapping of American citizens . . . .This administration acts like violating civil liberties is the way to enhance our security. It is not.<br /><br /><b>--Barack Obama, Aug. 1, 2007</b>",

"There is no such thing, at this date of the world's history, in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar weekly salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth; to lie outright; to pervert; to vilify; to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes.

"I am delighted to be here in these new [Council on Foreign Relations] headquarters. I have been often to, I guess, the mother ship in New York City, but it’s good to have an outpost of the Council right here down the street from the State Department.

There is no need for such arbitrary power... Any system which gives so much power and so much discretion to a few men, [so] that mistakes - excusable or not - can have such far reaching effects, is a bad system.

"In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. ... This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists\' tirades against gold.

            <p><strong>- <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/033162_food_ingredients_chemicals.html">What&#8217;s really in the food? The A to Z of the food industry&#8217;s most evil ingredients</a> (NaturalNews, July 28, 2011): </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Ever wonder what&#8217;s <em>really</em> in the food sold at  grocery stores around the world? People keep asking me, &#8220;What  ingredients should I avoid?&#8221; So I put together a short list that covers  all the most toxic and disease-promoting ingredients in the food supply.  These are the substances causing cancer, diabetes, heart disease and  leading to tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary health care costs  across America (and around the world).</p>
<p>If you want to stay healthy and out of the hospital, <strong>read ingredients labels</strong> and make sure you avoid all these ingredients:</p>
<p><strong>Acrylamides</strong> &#8211; Toxic, cancer-causing chemicals formed in foods when <em>carbohydrates</em> are exposed to high heat (baking, frying, grilling). They&#8217;re present in  everything from bread crusts to snack chips, and because they aren&#8217;t  intentional ingredients, acrylamides do NOT have to be listed on labels.<span id="more-39144"></span></p>
<p><strong>Aspartame</strong> &#8211; Chemical sweetener that causes neurological disorders, seizures, blurred vision and migraine headaches. (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/030918_aspartame_GM_bacteria.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/030918_a&#8230;</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Autolyzed Proteins</strong> &#8211; Highly processed form of protein containing <em>free glutamate</em> and used to mimic the taste-enhancer chemical MSG.</p>
<p><strong>BPA (Bisphenol-A)</strong> &#8211; A hormone mimicking chemical found in nearly all food packaging plastics. Active in just <em>parts per billion</em>,  BPA promotes cancer, infertility and hormone disorders. It also  &#8220;feminizes&#8221; males, promoting male breast growth and hormone disruption (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/032860_BPA_feminization.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/032860_B&#8230;</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Casein</strong> &#8211; Milk proteins. Hilariously, this is widely used in &#8220;soy cheese&#8221;  products that claim to be alternatives to cow&#8217;s milk. Nearly all of them  are made with cow&#8217;s milk proteins.</p>
<p><strong>Corn Syrup</strong> &#8211; Just another name for High Fructose Corn Syrup (see below). Frequently used in <strong>infant formula</strong> products (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/029863_Similac_infant_formula.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/029863_S&#8230;</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Food Colors</strong> &#8211; FD&amp;C Red #40, for example, is linked to behavioral disorders in  children. Nearly all artificial food colors are derived from <em>petroleum</em>, and many are contaminated with <strong>aluminum</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Genetically Modified Ingredients</strong> &#8211; Not currently listed on the label because the GMO industry (Monsanto  and DuPont) absolutely does not want people to know which foods contain  GMOs.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Nearly all conventionally grown corn, soy and cotton are GMOs.  They&#8217;re linked to severe infertility problems and may even cause the  bacteria in your body to produce and release a <strong>pesticide</strong> in your own gut. If you&#8217;re not eating organic corn, you&#8217;re definitely eating GMO corn. </span>(<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/026426_GMO_food_GMOs.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/026426_G&#8230;</a>) Learn more at <a href="http://www.responsibletechnology.org/" target="_blank">www.ResponsibleTechnology.org</a> or watch my <strong>GMO music video</strong> (hilarious) at <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/NoGMO" target="_blank">www.NaturalNews.com/NoGMO</a></p>
<p><strong>High Fructose Corn Syrup</strong> &#8211; A highly processed liquid sugar extracted with the chemical solvent <strong>glutaraldehyde</strong> and frequently contaminated with mercury (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/032948_high_fructose_corn_syrup_glutaraldehyde.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/032948_h&#8230;</a>).  It&#8217;s also linked to diabetes, obesity and mood disorders. Used in  thousands of grocery items, including things you wouldn&#8217;t suspect like  pizza sauce and salad dressings.</p>
<p><strong>Homogenized Milk</strong> &#8211; The fats in the milk are artificially modified to change them into smaller molecules that stay <em>in suspension</em> in the milk liquid (so the milk fat doesn&#8217;t separate) (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/022967_milk_pasteurization_dairy.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/022967_m&#8230;</a>).  While it makes milk look better on the shelf, it&#8217;s also blamed for  promoting heart disease and may contribute to milk allergies. <strong>Raw milk</strong> is healthier, which is why the government had outlawed it (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/029322_raw_milk_Amish.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/029322_r&#8230;</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Hydrochloride</strong> &#8211; When you see <em>anything</em> hydrochloride, such as Pyridoxine Hydrochloride or Thiamin Hydrochloride, those are <strong>chemical forms of B vitamins</strong> that companies add to their products to be able to claim higher RDA  values of vitamins. But these are synthetic, chemical forms of vitamins,  not real vitamins from foods or plants. Nutritionally, they are  near-useless and may actually be bad for you. Also watch out for <strong>niacinamide</strong> and <strong>cyanocobalamin</strong> (synthetic vitamin B-12). (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/032766_cyanocobalamin_vitamin_B-12.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/032766_c&#8230;</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein</strong> &#8211; A highly processed form of (usually) soy protein that&#8217;s processed to  bring out the free glutamate (MSG). Use as a taste enhancer.</p>
<p><strong>Partially Hydrogenated Oils</strong> &#8211; Oils that are modified using a chemical catalyst to make them stable at room temperature. This creates <strong>trans fatty acids</strong> and greatly increases the risk of blocked arteries (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/027445_fat_fats_trans.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/027445_f&#8230;</a>).  It also promotes what I call &#8220;sludge blood,&#8221; which is thick, viscous  blood that&#8217;s hard to pump. This is usually diagnosed by doctors as &#8220;high  blood pressure&#8221; and (stupidly) treated with blood-thinning medications  that are technically the same chemicals as <strong>rat poison</strong> (warfarin) (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/023149_drug_drugs_pharmas.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/023149_d&#8230;</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Phosphoric Acid</strong> &#8211; The acid used in sodas to dissolve the carbon dioxide and add to the  overall fizzy-ness of the soda. Phosphoric acid will eat steel nails.  It&#8217;s also used by stone masons to etch rocks. The military uses it to  clean the rust off battleships. In absolutely destroys tooth enamel (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/021774.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/021774.html</a>). Search Google Images for &#8220;Mountain Dew Mouth&#8221; to see photos of teeth rotted out by phosphoric acid: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=mountain+dew+mouth&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=ivns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/search?q=moun&#8230;</a></p>
<p><strong>Propylene Glycol</strong> &#8211; A liquid used in the automotive industry to winterize RVs. It&#8217;s also used to make the <strong>fake blueberries</strong> you see in blueberry muffins, bagels and breads. (Combined with  artificial colors and corn syrup.) See shocking &#8220;Fake Blueberries&#8221; video  at: <a href="http://www.naturalnews.tv/v.asp?v=7EC06D27B1A945BE85E7DA8483025962" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.tv/v.asp?v=7&#8230;</a></p>
<p><strong>Sodium (Salt)</strong> &#8211; The processed white salt lacking in trace minerals. In the holistic  nutrition industry, we call it &#8220;death salt&#8221; because it promotes disease  and death. Real salt, on the other hand, such as &#8220;dirty&#8221; sea salt or  pink Himalayan salt, is loaded with the trace minerals that prevent  disease, such as selenium (cancer), chromium (diabetes) and zinc  (infectious disease). Much like with bread and sugar, <strong>white salt</strong> is terrible for your health. And don&#8217;t be fooled by claims of &#8220;sea salt&#8221;  in grocery stores. All salt came from the sea if you go far back enough  in geologic time, so they can slap the &#8220;sea salt&#8221; claim on ANY salt!</p>
<p><strong>Sodium Nitrite</strong> &#8211; A cancer-causing red coloring chemical added to bacon, hot dogs,  sausage, beef jerky, ham, lunch meats, pepperoni and nearly all  processed meats. Strongly linked to brain tumors, pancreatic cancers and  colon cancers (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/007024.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/007024.html</a>).  The USDA once tried to ban it from the food supply but was  out-maneuvered by the meat industry, which now dominates USDA  regulations. Sodium nitrite is a complete poison used to make meats look  fresh. Countless children die of cancer each year from sodium  nitrite-induced cancers.</p>
<p><strong>Soy Protein</strong> &#8211; The No. 1 protein  source used in &#8220;protein bars,&#8221; including many bars widely consumed by  bodybuilders. Soy protein is the &#8220;junk protein&#8221; of the food industry.  It&#8217;s made from genetically modified soybeans (often grown in China) and  then subjected to <em>hexane</em>, a chemical solvent (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/026303_soy_protein_hexane.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/026303_s&#8230;</a>) that can literally explode.</p>
<p><strong>Sucralose</strong> &#8211; An artificial chemical sweetener sold as <em>Splenda</em>. The sucralose molecule contains a <strong>chlorine</strong> atom (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/027491_aspartame_sweeteners_health.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/027491_a&#8230;</a>). Researchers have repeatedly found that artificial sweeteners <strong>make people fat</strong> by actually promoting weight gain (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/024543_health_Splenda_weight.html" target="_blank">http://www.naturalnews.com/024543_h&#8230;</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Sugar</strong> &#8211; The bleached, nutritionally-deficient byproduct of cane processing.  During sugar cane processing, nearly all the minerals and vitamins end  up in the <strong>blackstrap molasses</strong> that&#8217;s usually fed to farm animals.  (Blackstrap molasses is actually the &#8220;good&#8221; part of sugar cane juice.)  Molasses is often fed to farm animals because every rancher knows that  farm animals need good nutrition to stay alive. Amazingly, conventional  doctors don&#8217;t yet realize this about humans, and they continue to claim  that eating sugar is perfectly fine for you. Sugar promotes diabetes,  obesity, mood disorders and nutritional deficiencies.</p>
<p><strong>Textured Vegetable Protein</strong> &#8211; Usually made of <strong>soy protein</strong> which is extracted from genetically modified soybeans and then processed using <strong>hexane</strong>,  an explosive chemical solvent (see Soy Protein, above). Widely used in  vegetarian foods such as &#8220;veggie burgers&#8221; (most of which also contain  MSG or Yeast Extract, by the way).</p>
<p><strong>Yeast Extract</strong> &#8211; Hidden form of MSG that contains <em>free glutamate</em> and is used in many &#8220;natural&#8221; food products to claim &#8220;No MSG!&#8221; Yeast  extract contains up to 14% free glutamate. You&#8217;ll find it in thousands  of grocery store products, from soups to snack chips. I even once  spotted it used on fresh meat!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Food label tricks</span></strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a  trick food companies frequently used to pack more sugar into their  products without making sugar look like the first ingredient:</p>
<p>Ingredient  labels, you see, must list the most prominent ingredients first, and  some consumers might freak out of they saw a box of cereal that said,  &#8220;Sugar, whole grain wheat, corn&#8221; and so on. Instead, the company uses 3  or 4 different forms of sugar to distribute them farther down the label,  like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Whole grain wheat, sugar, corn syrup, corn syrup solids&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>This way, the first ingredients looks like &#8220;whole grain wheat&#8221; when, in reality, the cereal might be <strong>over fifty percent sugars!</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to buy honest food</strong></span></p>
<p>• Shop are your local farmer&#8217;s market, food co-op or CSA.</p>
<p>• In the USA, look for the <strong>USDA Organic</strong> label on foods. This is a legitimate claim to being certified organic.  It&#8217;s one of the few programs run by the USDA that actually has  integrity.</p>
<p>• Read the ingredients labels! If you see names of chemicals you can&#8217;t pronounce, don&#8217;t buy it.</p>
<p>•  Buy more unprocessed food ingredients and make your own meals rather  than buying ready-to-eat, processed foods, which are almost universally  formulated with disease-promoting ingredients.</p>
<p>• GROW some of your own food! The best food you can ever eat is food from your own garden.</p>
