  <title>FactCheck.org: Belittling Palin?</title>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">
  <meta name="description" content="The McCain-Palin campaign has released a new TV ad that distorts quotes from the Obama campaign. It takes words out of context to make it sound as though the Democratic ticket is being dismissive of Palin. The ad says "they said she was doing 'what she was told.' " But that's flagrantly misleading. "They" never said Palin was "doing" anything. The ad refers to a quote by an Obama adviser who used just the four words, "what she was told," when responding to a charge Palin made about Obama's legislative record. He actually said "maybe that's what she was told." It says Obama and Biden "dismissed her as 'good looking,' " when, in fact, the phrase comes from a self-deprecating remark Biden made comparing his looks to that of the Republican vice presidential candidate.

It takes words out of context to make it sound as though the Democratic ticket is belittling Palin:<br />
</font>
<ul>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial">The ad says &quot;they said she was doing 'what she was told.' &quot; But the Obama adviser who's being quoted didn't accuse Palin of meekly following orders. What he actually said is that she made a false claim about Obama's legislative record and added, &quot;maybe that's what she was told.&quot;</font></li>
    <font size="3" face="Arial">    <font size="3"><font face="Arial"><br />
    </font></font>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial">It says &quot;they lashed out at Sarah Palin; dismissed her as 'good looking,' &quot; But &quot;they&quot; didn't lash out at all. Obama &ndash; who is the one pictured &ndash; didn't say anything like that. The only one the McCain campaign quotes is Obama's running mate, Biden, and he actually offered the remark as a compliment. Biden said the &quot;obvious&quot; difference between Palin and himself is &quot;she's good looking.&quot;<br />
    <br />
    </font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Arial">The ad says Obama was &quot;disrespectful&quot; when he accused Palin of &quot;lying&quot; about her record. But the truth is Palin's claim to have &quot;said no&quot; to the &quot;bridge to nowhere&quot; is indeed a dubious one, as we and many have pointed out.<br />
    </font></li>
    </font></ul></div><div class="article_section_header"><span>Analysis</span></div><div class="article_section"><font size="3">The new McCain-Palin ad &quot;Disrespectful&quot; begins like an earlier ad we <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/obamas_celebrity_cred.html">criticized</a>, with its reference to Barack Obama's celebrity, but then goes down new paths of deception. It takes quotes from news organizations and uses them out of context in an effort to portray Obama and his running mate, Joe Biden, as unfairly attacking Sarah Palin and making sexist remarks. We've <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/misleading-ads/faking_news_in_the_illinois_governor_race.html">long</a> been a <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2006/fake_news_nebraska_style.html">critic</a> of candidates (<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/obamas_creative_clippings_part_deux.html">Obama</a> <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/obamas_creative_clippings.html">included</a>) usurping the credibility of independent news organizations and peddling false quotes, and this ad is particularly egregious. We found it airing in Denver on Sept. 10, as recorded by the Campaign Media Analysis Group, a unit of TNS Media Intelligence.<br />

<strong> Narrator:</strong> He was the world's biggest celebrity, but his star is fading. So they lashed out at Sarah Palin. Dismissed her as good looking. That backfired. So they said she was doing what she was told. Then desperately called Sarah Palin a liar. How disrespectful. And how Governor Sarah Palin proves them wrong every day.</font></font></font></div>
<font size="3">The ad says Obama and Biden &quot;lashed out at Sarah Palin. Dismissed her as &lsquo;good looking.&rsquo; &quot;<br />
<br />
That&rsquo;s misleading. The reference is to a report of Biden joking that one of the differences between Palin and him is that &ldquo;she&rsquo;s good looking.&rdquo; But <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/08/oh-that-joe-n-2.htmlhttp://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/08/oh-that-joe-n-2.html">the report cited in the ad</a> doesn't characterize Biden&rsquo;s remarks as dismissive. Instead, ABC News&rsquo; Jake Tapper and Matt Jaffe describe a moment when Biden &ldquo;ham[s] it up&rdquo; for the crowd, with one woman telling Biden that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;gorgeous.&rdquo; The Democratic candidate then says he&rsquo;d like to end &ldquo;on a serious note.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s the quote in context:  <br />
</font><blockquote><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><strong>ABC News, Aug. 31, 2008:</strong> &quot;From our perspective the whole deal is how does the government help you get back up without getting in the way?&quot; Biden asked. &quot;There's a gigantic - gigantic - difference between John McCain and Barack Obama, and between me and I suspect my vice presidential opponent. And that is that - &quot;</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><br />
</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The crowd laughed.</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><br />
</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well there's obvious differences,&quot; Biden said, beginning to ham it up. &quot;She's good looking,&quot; he said, laughing. &quot;You know there's obvious differences. But there's a whole lot -- &quot;</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><br />
</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A woman shouted: &quot;you're gorgeous!&quot; to Biden.</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><br />
</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Where's that person?&quot; Biden asked. &quot;Who said that? Who said that? Would you say that again for my wife?&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><br />
</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;You're gorgeous!&quot; the woman yelled.</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><br />
</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Oh, I tell you what, would you make sure Jill hears that?&quot; Biden joked. &quot;You know what I mean? I just want to make sure she hears that. I haven't heard that in a long, long, long time. And hanging out with this lean, young-looking guy is making me feel pretty old, you know what I mean?&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><br />
</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Biden continued his riff. &quot;I thought I was in pretty good shape til I hung out with this guy, you know what I mean?&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><br />
</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Joe's looking good,&quot; said Obama.</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><br />
</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Yeah, I'm looking good alright, I tell you what,&quot; Biden said. &quot;But look, folks, let me end with, on a serious note here. On a serious note -- I was a pretty good football player, man,&quot; he said to Obama &quot;We oughta talk a little bit after this. Okay? --But look, on a very serious note ...&quot;</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><br />
</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He then continued with his very serious note.<br />
</font></blockquote><font size="3" face="Arial">Our ears don't hear Biden's &quot;good looking&quot; comment as dismissive. To the contrary, it's clearly a self-deprecating remark made in joking about himself and his looks. And by the way, the ad shows a picture of Obama next to the &quot;good looking&quot; quote, but it was Biden, not Obama, who said that.&nbsp;   </font><blockquote> </blockquote>
<div align="center"><font size="3"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><font face="Arial">Marching Orders?</font></font></font><br />
</div>
<font size="3"> </font> <font size="3"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><font size="4"><br />
</font> </font> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font face="Arial">The ad continues to imply sexism by claiming that &quot;they said she was doing 'what she was told.' &quot; Presumably &quot;they&quot; are the Democrats. But no one said anything close to that. Rather, the McCain ad took a fragment of an actual statement by an Obama adviser and carefully added language to alter the meaning. <br />
<br />
The ad cites a Sept. 4 <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Axelrod_on_Palin.html">report</a> from Ben Smith's blog at Politico.com in which he interviewed Obama adviser David Axelrod about Palin's speech at the Republican </font></font></font></font><font size="3"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font face="Arial">National </font></font></font></font><font size="3"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font face="Arial">Convention. <br />
<br />
The full quote reads:</font><br />
</font> </font></font><blockquote><font size="3"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Axelrod, quoted by Politico, Sept. 4:</strong> &quot;She tried to attack Obama by saying he had no significant legislative accomplishments &mdash; <strong>maybe that&rsquo;s what she was told </strong>&mdash; but she should talk to Sen. Lugar, talk to Sen. Coburn, talk to people across the aisle in Illinois where he passed dozens of major laws to expand health care reform welfare, reduce taxes on working families.&quot;</font></font></font></blockquote><font size="3"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font face="Arial">Axelrod's statement, as reported, was about information that Palin was given: &quot;maybe that's what she was told.&quot; <font size="3" face="Arial">The McCain-Palin campaign manipulated the phrase to make it sound as though he  </font></font></font><font size="3" face="Arial">was alleging that Palin took orders: &quot;doing what she was told.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font face="Arial">T</font><font size="3"><font face="Arial">he rest of the interview actually included some praise from Axelrod for Palin. For instance, he said she is a &ldquo;skilled politician.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
And, again, the quote used in the ad wasn't said by Obama, either &ndash; though his photo appears next to it.<br />
<br />
</font></font></font></font>
<div align="center"><font size="4">Speaking of Dismissive<br />
</font>
<div align="left"><font size="3"><font face="Arial"><br />
The ad wraps up by saying Obama and Biden &quot;</font></font><font size="3" face="Arial"><font size="3">desperately called Sarah Palin a liar.&quot; And it adds, &quot;How disrespectful.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reference is to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBtbG5xjFBY">an ad</a> the Obama-Biden campaign released in which it criticizes Palin for saying she was against the infamous Bridge to Nowhere when she had previously been for it. (We <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/gop_convention_spin_part_ii.html">called into question</a> Palin's comments on the bridge last week.) The Obama ad says, &ldquo;Politicians lying about their records. You don&rsquo;t call that maverick, you call it more of the same.&rdquo; It then quotes <a href="http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stump/archive/2008/09/08/she-stopped-the-bridge-to-nowhere.aspx">an item</a> from the liberal magazine <em>The New Republic, </em>which called the claim that Palin stopped the pork-barrel bridge project &quot;a naked lie.&quot;<br />
<br />
</font></font><font size="3" face="Arial"><font size="3"> As we're fond of saying, we can't read minds. So we can't determine whether the McCain campaign means to say that calling a woman a liar is disrespectful&nbsp;&ndash; or whether it's just disrespectful to say that of Palin. But in either case, &quot;<em>disrespectful&quot;</em>? Wait a minute. Isn't this politics?</font></font></div>
