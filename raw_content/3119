<B>Course Description<BR>
</B>This interdisciplinary course examines the way in which products
and machines work: their physical operation, the manner in which
they are constructed, and the design and societal considerations
that determine the difference between success and failure in the
marketplace. Students from a variety of engineering majors work
in teams to dissect several common industrial and consumer products.
In the process, they decipher the internal functions in terms
of basic physical principles, and examine issues of design, manufacturing,
materials selection, ethics and green design. This course relies
on problem-based learning and hands-on laboratory experience closely
coupled to classroom lectures. Heavy emphasis is placed on the
development of mental visualization skills and the development
of team and communication skills.

This course is intended for freshman or sophomore level students
of all engineering majors. It is a required course in the <I>Product
Realization Minor</I>. It was developed by the Manufacturing Engineering
Education Partnership,
a coalition of Penn State, The University of Puerto-Rico Mayaguez,
the University of Washington and Sandia National Labs. Funding
was provided by the Technology Reinvestment Program.

<li><b>Bicycle Dissection </B>- Used bicycles (typically 10 speed versions) are dissected and refurbished.  Students explore engineering principles such as work, energy, power transmission, materials, biomechanics – things they never thought of before when they rode their bike. <br>

<li><b>Power Drill Dissection </B>- Electric hand drills from a variety of manufacturers are dissected and reassembled in working order.  Students explore electrical and mechanical drive hardware, such as motors, bearings, gears.  Drills from different 
manufacturers are compared for their design, ease of manufacture and cost.<br>

<LI> <B>Single Use Camera Dissection </B>- The single use camera, first invented by Kodak, is an example of a high volume, low cost product which is designed to have a high content of re-used parts and recycled materials.  Students dissect two consecutive versions and identify product improvements.  Issues of injection molding, design for manufacture, and design for recycling are examined.<br>

<li><b>Lawnmower Engine Dissection </B>- Virtually every aspect of mechanical engineering can be found in an internal combustion engine, and most students are instantly attracted to them. Students dissect, reassemble and troubleshoot a lawnmower engine.  In the process, they learn about combustion, carburetors, cooling, ignition systems, lubrication, materials and proper use of tools.<br>

<li><B>Telephone Dissection -</B> Students dissect rotary dial telephones, as well as modern electronic versions.  The rotary dial telephone, while now obsolete, is an excellent example of an electro-mechanical device.  The ringing mechanism, the rotary dial governor, and the carbon microphone are extremely clever devices. They provide an opportunity to discuss the invention and history of the telephone.  By comparing with modern telephones, the students also can 
see the evolution of a product, from electro-mechanical, to computer-integrated.<BR>

<li><B>Product Benchmarking </B>- Benchmarking and competitive analysis are important tools for product design, whereby design and manufacturing information is gleaned from existing products.  Students benchmark the performance of kitchen mixers from a variety of manufacturers. The results of the benchmarking are used to conceptually design the “ultimate” hand mixer.  <br>
