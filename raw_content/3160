<div class="entry">
<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/04/shakshuka/" title="shakshuka"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4072/4502340031_7179576398.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="shakshuka" /></a></p>
There are a lot of reasons to make <i>shakshuka</i>, an Israeli dish of eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce: It sounds like the name of a comic book hero. Or some kind of fierce, long-forgotten martial art. Or perhaps something that said comic book hero would yell as they practiced this elaborate martial art, mid-leap with their fist in the air.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/4502970724/" title="peppers, garlic, onion and tomatoes"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4502970724_e868ec7c8c.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="peppers, garlic, onion and tomatoes" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/4502974112/" title="garlic, chiles and onion"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4502974112_8b5c70beda.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="garlic, chiles and onion" /></a></p>
<p>Or you could make it because when I talked about <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/09/eggs-in-tomato-sauce-contest-winners/">making eggs in tomato sauce a while back</a> a large handful of comments were along the lines of &#8220;oh, this sounds like shakshuka&#8221; and &#8220;I think you would love shakshuka&#8221; and &#8220;you really should make shakshuka&#8221; and you may have shrugged and forgotten about it until you finally had it at a caf&#233; one day and <i>whoa</i> it turns out you really <i>would</i> like shakshuka!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/4502971382/" title="peppers and onions"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4048/4502971382_f39dea3fb5.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="peppers and onions" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-6014"></span></p>
<p>Or you could make it because <a href="http://www.hummusplace.com/">that caf&#233;</a> had the audacity to close for Passover last week, right when you had the fiercest shakshuka craving yet. I mean, couldn&#8217;t they just not serve it with pitas? Must I eventually be forced to make <i>everything</i> myself? Can&#8217;t I just have one thing that I let other people make perfectly for me, every time? No, I could not. Not if I wanted to eat what I really wanted to eat.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/4502971944/" title="kicky tomato sauce"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4502971944_95acd00b0b.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="kicky tomato sauce" /></a></p>
<p>Thus, I suggest you make it because it turns out that it tastes really, really good from your own kitchen. Fantastically good. And not only is it easy to make, it&#8217;s budget-friendly, waistline-friendly and no-time-to-cook friendly. It could be a weekend brunch or a weekday dinner or lunch or a &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe we are being assaulted with a snowstorm in April!&#8221; consolation prize.  It could be part of an Israeli dinner party, replete with <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/07/a-salad-palette/">homemade salad</a>, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2009/03/pita-bread/">pitas</a> and <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/01/with-glee-and-ebullience/">hummus</a> or it could be a &#8220;my favorite takeout joint had the nerve to close for a holiday!&#8221; pity party. But I&#8217;ll warn you: me <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/uploads/jacobhummusplace.jpg">and my little buddy</a> walked by the caf&#233; today and breathed a sigh of relief that it had reopened so I could be freed from <i>making my own lunch</i> once again. And then I remembered how good the homemade shakshuka had been. And I kept on walking, kicking myself for always going and creating more work for myself. I never learn.</p>

<p><b>Shakshuka  [Eggs Poached in Spicy Tomato Sauce]</b><br />
Adapted from <a href="http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Eggs-Poached-in-Tomato-Sauce">Saveur</a></p>
<p>Serves 4 to 6</p>
<p>1/4 cup olive oil<br />
5 Anaheim chiles or 3 jalape&#241os, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped (I was nervous and only used 2 Anaheims; I would go for 3 or 4 next time for a more moderate but still gentle kick)<br />
1 small yellow onion, chopped<br />
5 cloves garlic, crushed then sliced<br />
1 teaspoon ground cumin<br />
1 tablespoon paprika<br />
1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, undrained<br />
Kosher salt, to taste<br />
6 eggs<br />
1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled<br />
1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley<br />
Warm pitas, for serving</p>
<p>Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add chiles and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden brown, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, and paprika, and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is soft, about 2 more minutes.</p>
<p>Put tomatoes and their liquid into a medium bowl and crush with your hands. Add crushed tomatoes and their liquid to skillet along with 1/2 cup water, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened slightly, about 15 minutes. Season sauce with salt.</p>
<p>Crack eggs over sauce so that eggs are evenly distributed across sauce&#8217;s surface. Cover skillet and cook until yolks are just set, about 5 minutes. Using a spoon, baste the whites of the eggs with tomato mixture, being careful not to disturb the yolk. Sprinkle shakshuka with feta and parsley and serve with pitas, for dipping.</p>

				<p>This looks fantastic.  I am usually nervous about putting eggs in places they&#8217;ve never been before in my kitchen, but with the feta, the parsley, and the glowing recommendation, I&#8217;m game.  Perhaps for tomorrow&#8217;s lunch, since I have each and every ingredient.</p>
<p>Congratulations on Saveur.  It is well deserved!</p>

				<p>isn&#8217;t it funny how many countries have very similar dishes? In Mexico you can find this as &#8220;Rabo de mestiza&#8221; (translated to english it would mean something very weird, trust me you don&#8217;t want to know), the only slight difference is that Poblano peppers are used instead of Anaheim or Jalapeños, and no paprika.<br />
I prsonally never liked it ( im not a huge egg  fan) but everyone else in my family loves it!</p>

				<p>My kosher Israeli friend made this once for lunch (minus the feta).  It was my most favorite thing ever!  I&#8217;m so excited to try my own hand at it!  She used some exotic spice with no label.  Curious&#8230;</p>

				<p>This sounds marvelous, and definitely worthy of a batch of homemade pita! I find it hard to resist anything with egg and tomato.<br />

				<p>Funny, I didn&#8217;t even know you were in NY, but as soon as I hear shakshuka I think of the Hummus Place &#8211; best I&#8217;ve ever had (better than 2 different places in Israel).  But feta?  You need the halumi!  They regularly have it at Whole Foods&#8230;</p>

				<p>So glad to see this featured here! It&#8217;s been one of my favorites since we moved to Israel a couple years ago and it&#8217;s my turn-to comfort food during pregnancy. I&#8217;ve been kicking myself for never learning to make it at home &#8211; now happily totting up how many shekels this post is going to save me. ;)<br />
Congrats on Saveur &#8211; most deserved!</p>

				<p>Jon &#8212; I know! I love the haloumi they put on it. And I can find it, but I know it&#8217;s not the easiest for most people to so when I saw this recipe that suggested feta (which was a delicious, and more melty contrast) I ran with it.</p>

				<p>This sounds like the original idea behind my favorite brunch selection at Casimir on the corner of Ave B and 7th Street &#8211; it&#8217;s called Tunisian Eggs on their brunch menu and since their chefs have changed over the years it&#8217;s always a little different, but I picture the ingredients hanging on the wall in the kitchen &#8211; sometimes it&#8217;s served in a lovely ceramic dish that&#8217;s hot to the touch, sometimes it seems microwaved, but I always love the combination of spicy tomato sauce, eggs, cheese and capers.  With a bloody mary, life is good.  Thanks for this recipe to try it at home!</p>

				<p>Shashuka is one of our regular&#8217;s, but in Israel we actually don&#8217;t eat it with pita/ You need a nice sauce-absorbing bread, so we go for the basic white bread or challa. Also. if you control the heat, the kids love it too</p>

				<p>Looks great :).<br />
However, although there are naturally dozens of ways to make Shakshuka (and I live in Israel), usually we also use green bell peppers for this recipe, and no cheese. The feta cheese is used in another version, in which usually no tomatoes are used, but rather spinach leaves.<br />
Anyway, like I said &#8211; looking good :)</p>

				<p>Oh, and by the way, there&#8217;s almost no such thing as original &#8220;Israeli&#8221; cuisine. Most of the cuisine is just an adaptation from eastern europe or north africa, which came with the Jews who arrived to Israel after WW2. In this case, that version of Shakshuka is indeed from North Africa (Morocco, Lybia, Tunisia, Algir &#8211; I think it was popular in all of them), while the feta/spinach version I was talking about earlier, comes from Turkey and Bulgaria.</p>

				<p>Just wondering&#8211; isn&#8217;t a shakshuka originally a Libyan dish? I have no doubt that it might have been adopted by them, but I thought it was interesting that it&#8217;s primarily know as Israeli, even though it&#8217;s inherently Libyan.</p>

				<p>Oh my gosh! I am so happy to find this recipe! I have vivid memories of landing in Tel Aviv after a 12 hour flight from JFK (after flying from the West Coast) and being dragged, half asleep, to this little hole in the wall restaurant. The cook spoke no English, and I no Hebrew, so he invited us back to the kitchen to point to what we wanted to eat. I chose the shakshuka. It was amazing.</p>

				<p>Don&#8217;t agree that Israeli shakshuka uses green bell peppers. Smitten Kitchen has the ingredient list exactly right,  other than the feta cheese, which is definitely an original.  Some people would even quibble that the onions don&#8217;t belong. </p>
<p>Interestingly, food (and people) from Libya are referred to in Israel as &#8220;Tripolitanian&#8221;, not Libyan.  Could be that the Jews from Libya preferred to relate to an elite cultural and colonial identity rather than a Muslim/nationalist one.  Similar to Alexandrian Greeks and Jews.</p>

				<p>Looks delicious!! Though I live in Israel I hardly ever make shakshuka&#8230;<br />
But now I know what to do with all the gorgeous red and green bell peppers I couldn&#8217;t help buying :). SAGI is right: we don&#8217;t use feta in this dish here but the bell peppers definitely belong in there.</p>

				<p>Okay, I think you&#8217;ve figured out a nice little scheme here. You hide photos of Jacob so I HAVE to click through to see the entire recipe, I find said photo of Jacob and get my cuteness dosage for the day, and then you entice me with a gorgeous photo spread and words like &#8220;onion,&#8221; &#8220;garlic,&#8221; &#8220;cumin,&#8221; and &#8220;feta&#8221; peppered throughout, and I can&#8217;t help but make a midnight run to the nearby Safeway to buy the missing ingredients.</p>
<p>Yep. A big, delicious scheme with my local supermarket. :)</p>

				<p>Addendum &#8211; Tripolitania was the name of one of the Italian colonies which make up modern day Libya, the other being Cyrenaica. Most of Libya&#8217;s Jews lived in Tripoli, and as of 1941, 25% of the city was Jewish.  Most of Libya&#8217;s Jews left at or near the time that Libya became independant in 1949, which would explain why they refer to themselves as Tripolitanian and not Libyan. </p>
<p>And shakshuka DOESN&#8217;T include bell peppers!</p>

				<p>My 11 year old daughter&#8217;s favorite food is shakshuka &#8211; since we live in Israel, I guess that&#8217;s appropriate.  Since she&#8217;s also good in the kitchen, I think I&#8217;ll have HER make this for dinner one night &#8211; thanks!</p>

				<p>I expected a to see a completely different dish when I saw the name &#8220;shakshuka&#8221;, for us,in Turkey, shaksuka is aubergines, green peppers and potatoes deep fried and mixed with a tomato sauce very similar to above. A perfect meze you should also try ! I think the only common thing is the tomato sauce, perhaps sauce is  really what shakshuka is. What you cooked above perfectly is called &#8220;menemen&#8221; here, mostly a breakfast dish.<br />
Anyway as usual the recipe looks perfect ! Congratulations for the Saveur awards !</p>

				<p>I just made your eggs in tomato sauce for the first time last week! We recently moved to Holland and I&#8217;m thinking up all kinds of excuses to use the beautiful golden-yolked eggs that seem to be the standard here. You&#8217;ve just given two chili-addicts another egg excuse. (Given that I added a heap of hot red pepper flakes to your original recipe, I&#8217;m thinking this firey one is right up our alley.) Dank je wel.</p>

				<p>Just made this (well sort of, I halved some bits, and not others) &#8211; but it is tasty. And I don&#8217;t really like tomato based sauces. Or eggs. But this is nicely spicy, lots of textures and nice burst of saltyness and eggy bits that don&#8217;t really taste like eggs</p>

				<p>All the clamor about who really gets to claim shakshuka and what constitutes an &#8220;authentic&#8221; shakshuka recipe made me do some quick and superficial digging. I found this story, and it made me smile: <a href="http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=70870" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=70870</a></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have time or desire to copy and paste the link, a good summation of its Israeli-ness is in this quote: &#8220;Listening to the heated debate, I began to ponder whether shakshuka may be an extended metaphor for Israeli society. Like the men in the tent, shakshuka, too, had multiple origins, immigrated from different countries and cultures and was infused with foreign influences. Like the men in the tent, shakshuka has transcended its origins and transformed into a bona fide Israeli.&#8221;</p>

				<p>I live in Turkey where we also have a similar dish &#8211; called menemen. But the eggs are usually stirred into it in the last few minutes, rather than poached. Just tried your version and it&#8217;s great too. I agree, good crusty bread is key for soaking up the juices. We don&#8217;t usually use cheese but I&#8217;ll have to try some white cheese with it.</p>

Shakshuka eggs are hugely popular in Don Dhet island in the 1000 Islands area of Laos bizarrely &#8211; the story is that they only cooked very Laotian style dishes (read: fish head soup) and homesick Israelis taught them how to make these eggs and they&#8217;ve been on the menus ever since!</p>

				<p>This looks delicious. It&#8217;s always at times like these, when I see awesome egg recipes on this site, that I get sad because I don&#8217;t like eggs.

				<p>One problem I&#8217;ve always had with shakshuka is that when you cook the eggs on top of the sauce the heating is uneven and the yolks overcook before the whites have set.  One possibility is to make a well in the sauce, so the egg has direct contact withthe skillet, or to fry or poach the eggs separately and then add them.</p>

				<p>@MarkC , make sure that your sauce is not too dry and try putting a lid on the pan for a minute or so after you add the eggs (you can tell that this is probably what was done by the cook in the picture, given the faint white cast to the yolks). Remember that the eggs will continue to cook, even as you serve, so maybe err on the runny side.</p>
<p>This version would make my Muslim Tunisian friends smile in recognition, since they reckon one of the basic difference between their food and that of Jewish Tunisians lay in the amount of garlic used and five cloves suggests that there may be some truth to this.  Also, for them, a &#8216;chatchouka&#8217; can be used to describe something that&#8217;s a crazy mess, so I don&#8217;t think anyone needs to feel too precious about their own take on it.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the recipe.  I love shakshuka and eat it all the time when I am in Israel.  Haven&#8217;t found anyplace in Philadelphia that makes it, though, so I guess I&#8217;ll have to make it myself!  Jennifer (comment number 12) said her friend used some unlabeled spice.  It was most likely zatar (probably spelled wrong).  If you can&#8217;t find it at a market or spice store near you, it can be ordered online at Penzeys.</p>

				<p>&#8230;but they call a similar Mexican dish migas or chilaquiles, only with tortillas&#8230; Yes, yes, there are similar dishes all around the world, because eggs adapt to just about anything and tomatoes are awesome.

<p>There is room at the table for all of our recipe variants and for all of us.  All of us must eat, so let us sit down at the table with gratefulness and joy.  Shakshuka looks delicious, Deb &#8211; my sweetheart and I will surely add this to our rotation soon.  Thanks.</p>

				<p>&#8220;All dishes in the Middle East have now officially become &#8216;Israeli&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; I hardly think that was suggested! </p>
<p>I am surprised to wake up this morning and find that there is so much debate (and so much argument) over the origins of this dish. Variants of this dish exist all over the world. I called this version Israeli because a) the name is Israeli, b) the place that inspired me to make my own version is Israeli and c) the original recipe I used is Israeli. Thus, this version of the dish, for all intents and purposes, is Israeli. As for the Israeli version, its clearest origins are Lbyian. But I enjoy (and am hungry thinking about) all of the other international versions people have described.</p>
<p>One disadvantage of having automatically-approved comments is that unpleasantness that I&#8217;d otherwise weed out (comments clearly to incite argument, not to enrich a conversation) go right through even when I&#8217;m away from the computer. An advantage, however, is that you don&#8217;t need me around to have lively conversation! And so it goes&#8230;</p>
<p>Mark &#8212; Where do you see bell peppers?</p>

				<p>Wow, I&#8217;ve cracked an egg into my favorite tomato sauce before, but this spices things up.  But Deb, still not sure why you keep using those particular tomatoes.  Recently, at least in NYC, there has been a big shipment of real D.O.P. San Marzano&#8217;s (La Valle in the green can) that are so superior to anything else I&#8217;ve used.  Slightly pricey, but the real thing!  </p>
<p>Thanks for this latest recipe from the best cooking blog out there.</p>

				<p>Not sure this is what you want to hear about your blog, but I finally had to let you know that I click over here every time you post, even when I have zero interest in whatever recipe you&#8217;re writing about (like this one &#8211; not a fan of spicy or tomato), just to see Jacob.  So, uh, I guess that means keep posting him?  He&#8217;s simply scrumptious (which I say despite being completely biased in favor of my own scrumptious 8-month-olds).</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made one of the other variants of this dish, and ran out of san marzanos last night (when I used them for a huge messa minestrone). I loved the version I made, but I am always needing to re-search for where I saw the recipe. Your version looks more like my cup of tea and absolves me of looking for it over and over again! Thank you!</p>

				<p>Your recipes are always fascinating, even when they are not something I would ordinarily try.  This one is particularly interesting, both in its own concept and in the discussion.  I have made many of your recipes and they are, so far, universally successful!  For those who, like me, have an aversion to getting stuff all over our hands (and under long fingernails, in themselves a food safety issue), I suggest breaking the tomatoes with a potato masher. It works fast and doesn&#8217;t splatter.</p>

				<p>My grandmother Maria used to make eggs like this when I was a little girl.  We are 100% Italian.  They were called &#8220;Eggs in Purgatory.&#8221;  Very similar to this dish you call Shakshuka.  I don&#8217;t think she used green bell pepper.  Very similar though.  I can still smell the tomatoes cooking&#8230;&#8230;..yummy.  I would definitely try this one.  Love your website!!!</p>

				<p>I love the variety of ethnic foods that you find to try and then offer them to us for our eating experience.  I learn much from the information that your readership contributes, too, even when the discussion gets heated!  I think we can all relate a recipe that is familiar that is a variation on the named dishes found throughout the world.  Ingredients vary depending on what&#8217;s plentiful or in season, so a name may be the given based on the origin of the adaptation.  It&#8217;s okay!  Adaptation is what we all do to suit our circumstances and wonderful things come from it!</p>

				<p>I plan on making and reviewing this dish later (looks FAB!), but&#8230;:</p>
<p>KRIS: my bf works in the wine business and he said a few things.  First, avoid red wines with a lot of tannins or that are high alcohol.  If you must go with a red wine, try a chilled Lambrusco (there are two types, both sparkling &#8211; rose and a red &#8211; both are DELISH&#8230;the rose might be awesome).  He says you might be able to get away with a Pinot Noir as well, but a rose/white sounds better to me.  For a fun rose, he recommended the South of France (he said try Tavel or D&#8217;Anjou), and for a white, try a Riesling Kabinett (pref. from Mosel Valley in Germany), an Arneis (from Italy), or Gruner Veltliner (from Austria).  You could also try a low-alcohol sweet wine &#8211; Moscato d&#8217;Asti.<br />
I don&#8217;t know as much about wine as he does, but I&#8217;ve had all of the above and love each one.<br />
Sounds like a fun dinner!</p>

				<p>nancy &#8212; No. The original recipe used the same amount of sauce for 8 eggs. The shakshuka we like is a little saucier, so I dialed the eggs back.</p>
<p>Leigh &#8212; Use either. I used Hungarian, not smoked.</p>

				<p>thanks deb. I was wondering what i should have for dinner. What unique way to go budget and meatless. I&#8217;m afraid to use my fancy can of san marzanos- but if you think this is worth it, i&#8217;ll give it a try.</p>

				<p>Jeni &#8212; No reason to use your fanciest tomatoes. Well, I mean, I like good tomatoes in a dish where they are the main event, but no reason to go over-budget for what should be a simple, affordable meal.</p>

				<p>I just did a little happy dance &#8211; I have a big can of those tomatoes in my pantry and a dozen local pastured eggs in the fridge. I know what we&#8217;re having for breakfast tomorrow! And that picture of Jacob is verging on illegal levels of cuteness. He has the best expressions &#8211; he looks like such a sweet baby.</p>

				<p>Oh, I so want to try this but I&#8217;m having visions of ruining it all at the last minute because I can&#8217;t poach an egg, let alone do it IN a yummy looking tomato sauce.</p>
<p>Please someone reassure me that it&#8217;s easier than it sounds/looks or maybe give me some helpful tips? Thanks!</p>

				<p>Do I have to make up a new name for every recipe in which I change an ingredient? Does it really matter what a recipe is called or where it &#8220;officially&#8221; comes from? (or do I have to say &#8220;the area from which it comes?) (no, wait, fromwhereforth it originated -dang, this recipe thing is confusing!). I guess, just to be safe, when I make this I&#8217;ll call it Yummy Saucy Eggs. (kind of like when I make quiche. I tell my kids it&#8217;s Cheesy Egg Pie, so they&#8217;ll eat it!) :o)</p>

				<p>It is always great to find a new fix for quick lunch or dinner, and waist friendly too!<br />
@Paula D &#8211; Lafayette Hill : Funnily enough even tough I am Italian, I never heard of &#8216;egg in purgatory&#8217;! You never stop learning, do you? And I think that for filology&#8217;s sake it is nice and sometimes surprising to know the origin of a dish, and it is certainly interesting to know it comes from Lybia, but still, I don&#8217;t think it changes much in practice: a dish belongs to whoever cooks it or eats it. For example  I&#8217;m ready to even admit that nowadays pizza is as much American as it is Italian. They exist as two separate entities, and we have to admit it.</p>

				<p>Deb, I&#8217;ll have you know that because of you I have broken my New Year&#8217;s resolution: I have a big stack of recipes I&#8217;ve printed from the internet that I haven&#8217;t gotten around to trying yet.This past December I decided I couldn&#8217;t print anymore until I had gotten through at least half of that stack. I was doing fine&#8230;until I found your blog a few days ago. Now the stack is growing again. I have to get cooking!</p>

I&#8217;ve seen something similar called &#8220;Eggs in Hell&#8221; in Readymade magazine from &#8220;How to Cook (Eat?) a Wolf&#8221; which was apparently an amazing cookbook.</p>

				<p>Great Dish, beautiful photos.<br />
I just want to clarify the origin of this dish, the Walima Challenge for March was representing the Tunisian Cuisine and Shakshouka was our savoury dish …..<br />
This dish, with many variations, is a popular breakfast in North Africa, especially in Algeria and Tunisia.  Jewish Immigrants from the Maghreb Al Arabi have made this a popular breakfast dish in Israel.</p>

				<p>must be that there are lots of versions of poached eggs in tomato sauce! i made a similar dish a while back and it was italian and oh so tasty. i&#8217;m sure the chilis and feta add yet another dimension to this recipe though and will definitely try it out sometime!</p>

				<p>This is one of those recipes that&#8217;s not very exciting sounding and absolutely killer. I had this at a friend&#8217;s bridal shower that I was co-hosting. The woman in charge of the main dish told me about this and I thought, &#8220;meh&#8230;&#8221; and then was bowled over when I tasted it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to make it since and keep forgetting&#8230;thanks for the recipe!</p>

<p>When I opened the page today, I saw the title and thought: &#8220;Shakshuka? What&#8217;s tha&#8230;..Ohhhhhhh. I want that!!&#8221; </p>

				<p>dana &#8212; They are Kosher but they are not a meat restaurant. They will put haloumi on if you ask and it is wonderful. However, it is mostly cubed within the stew, less broiled.</p>
<p>heather &#8212; It is literally no effort. This isn&#8217;t like trying to keep and egg together in simmering water. You plop it in and the thick sauce does 99% of the work. It&#8217;s a messy dish, no perfectly wrapped poached eggs needed.</p>
<p>Robyn &#8212; It&#8217;s called the Hummus Place. (I link to it above.) There are a couple locations &#8230; their hummus is beyond. Light, creamy and heavy on the nuttiness. </p>
<p>Re, Eggs in Purgatory &#8212; You all probably know by now my attraction to any dish with an awesome name. (See: above.) Thus, obviously I have to try this next.</p>
<p>An overdue thank you &#8212; To reader Rebecca who had sent me this recipe with her approval in January. I&#8217;d gave me just the nudge I needed!</p>

				<p>yum. comments from someone who lives in Israel (where this dish is very popular):</p>
<p>-  first of all &#8211; the world is divided into two groups &#8211; those who like their shakshuka with whole eggs (as above) and those who like them scrambled into the sauce. try it both ways.<br />
- also, most shakshukas that I&#8217;ve met/cooked use a lot of onions &#8211; for this amount I would use 3-4 large onions, peeled and cubed.<br />
- for cook-ahead fans: this is a great dish to cook ahead. make the sauce and refrigerate or freeze for future use, adding the eggs when you reheat.<br />
- and it&#8217;s really really good piled into a good crusty bread.</p>

				<p>This may be popular in Israel but it is NOT an Israeli dish. </p>
<p>It is an Arab dish along with Hummus, falafel, shawirma, etc. Israel was created in 1947 and Arabs were eating these foods a long time before that.</p>

				<p>Lately, I was thinking to make some dish similar to this. But didn&#8217;t know that it is called Skakushka. I was thinking to make it in  individual ramekins for a tapas party  and serve it with a slice of garlic bread.</p>

				<p>Having recently discovered your recipe for eggs in tomatoes I&#8217;m really pleased to discover a new twist on it.  It&#8217;s so simple that I&#8217;ve been tempted to cook it every breakfast, dinner and lunch every day, so thank you for sharing this.  Can&#8217;t wait to serve it up for Sunday brunch.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m an israeli and I have some remarks :<br />
1) You eat it with a plain bread or Halla bread but definitely not with Pita bread.<br />
2)The classic version is without the feta cheese.<br />
3) It&#8217;s a whole meal, there is no need for a side dish. You just take a really large portion.</p>

				<p>great idea to make shakshuka! i love it at miriam in park slope, where it&#8217;s on the brunch menu (along with mediterranean crispy dough, which is amazing, and if you learned how to make it i&#8217;d be in your debt).</p>

				<p>I make a similar version but I adapted it from Dr. Shakshouka&#8217;s recipe.  I put in red peppers and leave out the cheese and chilies since Im not really a fan of kick.  A lot of sephardi grandmothers will leave the sauce simmering for hours before making the dish! It is as easy or hard as you want to make it. When I am in a real rush I fry up some red pepper, onions, fresh tomatos and garlic and dump in a jar of prepared tomato sauce.  I served it with toasted french stick type bread to dip in the sauce.  It&#8217;s low fat, filling and delicious!</p>

				<p>Funny you decided to post this now, did you know that Israel&#8217;s independence day is around the corner? (this year it falls on April 20th)<br />
We make our shakshuka a little different, we use a lot of red and green bell peppers (and some hot ones) and a lot of onions and just enough tomatoes to make it saucy, I like to char the peppers first in the cast iron skillet, it makes them sweet, smoky and delicious!</p>

				<p>I made this tonight, and it is fantastic! I went a little spicier, with a full 5 anaheims, as you suggested, and I&#8217;m glad I did. I dig spicy, and it had just the right amount of slow, creeping heat. Not &#8216;hot&#8217; by any stretch, but&#8230;yum. </p>
<p>Also, I had been looking for this recipe (or one like it) for months after seeing it on Bourdain or another of the Travel Channel shows, and was just thinking about it the other day, wishing I could ID it. And here it is! Thanks, Deb! :)</p>

				<p>Ooh. Shakshuka. (Actually, my recipe I ripped out of an old Sunset spells it shaksouka.) Like it! And it&#8217;s so easy. Here are my notes after making it when we in the middle of a contractor cleanup from a house flood:</p>
<p>&#8220;This dish was comprised of canned tomatoes, some spices, and two eggs. It took five minutes to prep and cooked in twenty in one pan on the stove.</p>
<p>The oven was not required, nor multiple pots, nor multiple drawers, etc. I did have to use my mortar and pestle, which I rinsed in the sink&#8221;.</p>
<p>I want to say mine only called for dried chili powders and coriander along with the cumin and paprika. Fortunately I had some leftover chopped onion from the day before.</p>
<p>I had mine with toasted bread; it was great. In future I would probably throw some spinach on the side, so long as we had no contractors around.</p>

				<p>Hi there. Sorry to ask what is probably a very stupid question, but what do you mean by &#8216; baste the whites of the eggs with tomato mixture&#8217;? As far as I know, basting is simply a word for cooking something in either it&#8217;s own juices, or some other juice, correct? If that is right, well&#8230; aren&#8217;t the egg whites already IN the tomato sauce? Two lines before we are told to break the eggs into the sauce&#8230;</p>
<p>Apologies again for being potentially very stupid, but I&#8217;m not a very experienced cook! Looking forward very much to taking a crack at this though &#8211; a friend of mine has been trying your recipes and literally raving about them.</p>

				<p>Ohmygoodness, these were SO good!!!<br />
This popped up on my blog reader just as I was putting together my shopping list for this week and it sounded so good.. I couldn&#8217;t wait to get home and start cooking it for a quick dinner.  I had to buy some ground cumin, it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ve ever cooked with before so thank you for adding another spice to my repertoire!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d encourage everyone who&#8217;s thinking this sounds like a pretty tasty recipe to give it a go &#8211; it&#8217;s definitely going to be on high rotation in my kitchen!<br />
So easy and so yummy! I halved the recipe and had it for dinner tonight and am looking forward to trying it already again &#8211; perhaps for a lazy Sunday breakfast in the morning! :)</p>
<p>Yummmm!</p>

				<p>Steven &#8212; No such thing as stupid questions! You&#8217;re spooning the sauce gently over the egg whites, helping bury the eggs only very slightly in the sauce so they cook more evenly (and not just underneath).</p>

				<p>I didn&#8217;t plan on making this last night, but ended up with a hungry friend who is vegetarian and one thing lead to another. It was absolutely delicious! I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what you meant by basting the eggs, but found the answer in the comment section. And scooped into a whole wheat pita&#8230; well, I just ate breakfast and still, I&#8217;m salivating at the thought of last night&#8217;s dinner. Thanks!</p>

				<p>I am Armenian from Iran and my family makes a version of this with fresh tomatoes and hot peppers as well. I haven&#8217;t had it in years, though we have been making &#8220;Eggs in Purgatory&#8221; that we learned from a Mario Batali cooking show and that many have noted above as being very similar.<br />
For those who insist that this is an Arab not an Israeli dish or whatever, please stop it. Those of us who are interested in studying and eating different kinds of food know that we can find versions of many dishes scattered throughout regions. Why wouldn&#8217;t the Israelis have a version of this dish? Rather than fighting over the origins of a dish, why not just share our experiences of different versions of it and stop with the blatant prejudicial remarks?</p>

				<p>&#8220;Mark, where do you see bell peppers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Not in your recipe, but some of your posters, who happen to be Israeli, claim that the dish takes bell peppers, which I, living in Israel for the last fifteen years, dispute.  However, I agree that it&#8217;s silly to argue over these things, and my comments were offered only as a matter of cultural interest. By the way (and not to be argumentative) I doubt that shakshuka is an &#8220;Israeli&#8221; word.  It isn&#8217;t Hebrew, but Arabic, and although I am no expert, it sounds like a strange kind of Arabic &#8211; like maybe Berber or something.  I&#8217;ll have to ask an Arabic-speaking friend.  If I find the derivation of the word, I will post it.  </p>
<p>I can also understand why people from Arabic countries would feel miffed that people describe their dishes as Israeli. As someone else remarked,  dishes like hummus and shakshuka existed long before Israel was created.  I think the only authentic Israeli food might be Israeli couscous (or &#8220;ptittim&#8221; &#8211; a kind of pasta, and not to be confused with North African couscous.)</p>

				<p>Yum &#8211; can&#8217;t wait to try this. They used to serve something similar at the boarding school where I worked in Germany (I can&#8217;t remember what they were called in German, but I&#8217;m pretty sure there was a connection with hell or the devil, so I guess I was eating Eggs in Purgatory). It was my favourite dish on the rotating menu &#8211; it was served on a Friday once a month, always accompanied by nutmeg-y mashed potatoes. Perfect comfort food.</p>

				<p>Score! I made eggs with tomato on toast a few weeks ago, and my friend that came over to try it and said that she loved the Israeli version of the dish, which I&#8217;d never heard of! I&#8217;m assuming that this is it! Slightly different since the Italian version suggests that you mix the egg whites in with the tomato sauce so the egg yolks just sit on the sauce, but I imagine it tastes very similar.  I&#8217;m gonna try this tonight! Looks amazing! </p>

				<p>Your baby boy is ADORABLE! What fun he must be :)</p>
<p>I made this dish about 2 hours after you posted the recipe. It smelled wonderful and was warm and surprisingly filling. I used 3 jalapeños and although I&#8217;m not big on spice, I will toss at least 2 more in next time!</p>
<p>As for all of these comments about the origins of the recipe&#8211; no dish is exclusively from or BY one culture. Cross pollination happens and cultures, traditions, food, art, it all is influenced by time and place. When you listen to Spanish flamenco music, how can you say you don&#8217;t hear the Arab influences? When you listen to Hawaiian ukulele music, you&#8217;re actually listening to an instrument native to Portugal, but the Hawaiians incorporated it into a music that&#8217;s their own. That&#8217;s like saying Jazz is 100% American music. It&#8217;s a musical BYPRODUCT of African slave songs, blues, and American instrumentation.</p>
<p>So to the people barking &#8220;It&#8217;s from LIBYA!&#8221; at this poor woman, chill out.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m not a bit commenter, but this recipe made my day.  I spent four and a half months living in Tel Aviv last year and fell in love with Shakshuka.  I&#8217;ve tried it once since I got home, but it was not a great recipe.  I can&#8217;t wait to try this one.  I really enjoy your site.  Thanks for keeping it up!</p>

				<p>Being an incurable nerd, I had to get to the bottom of the origins of shakshuka, and the final word seems to be that there is no definitive answer.  As the following article explains, the debate about where shakshouka comes from, and what the true ingredients are, rages on:<br />
 <a href="http://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/food/20762/shakshuka-israel%E2%80%99s-hottest-breakfast-dish" rel="nofollow">http://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/food/20762/shakshuka-israel%E2%80%99s-hottest-breakfast-dish</a></p>
<p>Claudia Roden, the foremost expert in Sephardic Jewish cooking, claims that while many versions of shakshuka exist throughout the Muslim world,  the version posted on Smitten Kitchen was indeed developed in Israel.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a Hebrew word &#8211; leshakshek- which means to scramble or mix-up, however, it is also entirely likely that this word comes from Arabic, so the mystery remains unsolved.</p>

				<p>I think the version of shakshuka that you shared seems very interesting and looks quite tasty. Im actually familar with the dish, however, its the egyptian version, which isnt quite as spicey and includes scallions and cut up tomatoes and peppers along with chopped onions.. the eggs are then scrambled into the mix after the other ingredients have had sometime to sweat on the stove.. interesting to see how recipes can be so similar but still quite different from region to region&#8230;</p>

				<p>i&#8217;m familiar with eggs in purgatory, so was very interested in trying this. we made it last night, a few notes:</p>
<p>1. it was way too liquidy. i let it cook longer than the 15 minutes and it was still very wet. this was ok while the eggs were cooking, but once i tried taking them out, the liquid to chunky sauce ratio was off. i poured off the extra liquid and next time will not add the extra 1/2 cup water. it could be the type of tomatoes i used had more liquid &#8211; we have limited choices in my part of canada. </p>
<p>2. it was not spicy. i used 3 jalapenos, seeded and stemed. they added great flavour, but it was very mild. next time i&#8217;ll put in a few of the seeds to give it some kick.</p>

				<p>I really liked the tomato sauce, and would probably make it again for some pasta. It was yummy. I had to substitute for the peppers, so I used a few small thai peppers and a sprinkle of dried pepper. It was great scooped on some toasted sourdough bread.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t care for the eggs, which is a main component of the dish, and I didn&#8217;t like the feta. I had set the feta aside so the family could put on as much or little as they liked. My first helping was with egg and feta, the second was the sauce scooped up with toast:) Did I mention I really liked the sauce:)</p>
<p>Congrats on your award, totally deserved. I love your site and get so much inspiration from it.</p>

				<p>When I&#8217;ve looked at recipes for shakshuka in the past, they often recommend that you roast the peppers first&#8212;I usually pierce them w/ a fork and hold it over the open stove flame. Is this necessary or does the saute do the trick?</p>

				<p>Shakshuka is absolutely spectacular. Nothing like freshly made eggs with tomatoes and peppers.  It goes great with a fresh loaf of bread, some tachine, hummus, and Israeli (Middle Eastern) salad!  I love having this for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!</p>

				<p>This is one of my very favorite brunch dishes! With some warm toasted pita&#8230; my mouth is watering!  I actually usually add a bit of diced eggplant to the tomato sauce as well, which gives the sauce itself a heartier texture that I like.  I may have to make this for dinner tomorrow. Yum!</p>

				<p>This sounded interesting so I made it today with a few adjustments. I don&#8217;t really like peppers and so I never buy them. I used a can of rotel instead lol. Even with overcooking the eggs a bit this was very tasty. Jacob is adorable and he&#8217;s getting so big!</p>

				<p>My Husband and I made this for lunch on Sat and it was delicious!! We used 2 green chillies and found that was perfect but I wouldnt mind using 1 or 2 more! We absolutely LOVE your website and use it all the time &#8211; one of our favourite recipes is the Blueberry Pancakes which I make all the time!! :)</p>

				<p>Green chilli&#8217;s in this sound like a good idea, it would be good to try it out with a range of chilli&#8217;s too like scotch bonnet too. Might try it with Duck eggs for that extra rich flavour</p>

				<p>If you use halloumi instead, do you just crumble it over the top like the feta, or do you have to heat it / grill it in any way?  Love halloumi but usually add it to roasted veg, so haven&#8217;t had it raw!  Thanks.  This looks yummy.</p>

				<p>Thanks so much for your website- my favorite &#8220;food porn&#8221; site for sure. I made this recipe last night and added shrimp and scallops at the end, as well as the eggs. It was really nice, with a complexity in the sauce that belies the ingredients. I also made the peanut butter cookie recipe on Friday, so delicious as well. Keep up the good work, you are inspiring!</p>

				<p>Rikki &#8212; Yes. Whites set, yolks runny. If you take them out when the whites are just set (can&#8217;t stand clear whites personally, shudder) the yolks should still be loose. If you let the whites cook past the &#8220;just set&#8221; point, the yolks may not be.</p>

				<p>Deb, I just must confess; I totally went against the spirit of this dish &#8212; on the kosher side and on the vegetarian side &#8212; by adding a large handful of cubed ham right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Forgive me mother for I have sinned. I have deliciously deliciously sinned.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t understand why people think Israel is trying to &#8220;steal&#8221; food from its neighbors.</p>
<p>Who cares where hummus came from or who invented shakshuka or how should the small-cubed-veg-salad called &#8211; Arab,Israeli,Lebanese&#8230;(there was a similar discussion in tha post of yours). just make it, eat it, and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>In Israel, where I live, the classic way to eat shakshuka is with fresh challa (like Maayan said earlier, in a pita is only &#8216;to go&#8217;), there&#8217;s no cheese in it but sometimes there are &#8216;mergez&#8217; spicy hot dogs in it&#8230;</p>

				<p>I never thought that the combination of eggs and tomatoes would be so delicious, but I really cannot get enough of this dish! Not only did I make it once and eat all the leftovers, i promptly made it again tonight since the leftovers were gone. Although my Israeli friend tells me that the feta is not authentic, I really like the way it combines with the flavors of the dish. I also have been eating this with a healthy dollop of Mediterranean yogurt. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe! I will definitely try this with various veggie combinations in the future!</p>

				<p>I love Shakshouka! I&#8217;m from Egypt and I grew up eating it a lot, though our version is made with ground beef and a lot of fresh tomatoes, and of course eggs! Shakshouka is very popular in Egypt, sometimes it is eaten for breakfast if you have a big crowd.</p>

				<p>Regarding the comments about country of origin for this dish, it seems to me that many of the &#8220;it&#8217;s Libyan&#8221; people were probably pointing this out as a matter of cultural interest, not criticism.  Mark clarified that he was, and I think we should give others the benefit of the doubt (it&#8217;s difficult, afterall, to infer tone from a written comment).  I love SK &#8212; the recipes, photography and writing are all amazing&#8211; but I&#8217;ve often thought, reading the comments, that some people are overly sensitive and defensive about anything that might possibly be construed as criticism of Deb.  (An just to be perfectly clear, this is not criticism of Deb!).  So, I guess what I&#8217;m saying is, maybe it&#8217;s the &#8220;stop criticizing Deb&#8221; folks who need to chill a little.</p>

				<p>I made this last night, using poblanos instead of anaheims, since that&#8217;s what I had on hand. I also had smoked paprika on hand rather than regular. Hubby and I quite liked the dish, but I think next time I&#8217;d add another poblano (or a jalapeno) to spice things up, and I&#8217;d use regular paprika, since I thought the smokiness was a bit overwhelming. </p>
<p>A very simple dish &#8212; fast, healthy and tasty. What more could you want?</p>

				<p>Hey Deb,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a silent reader &#8211; I think it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;m commenting here. This post really made me smile. As a Tel Avivian male bachleor (Meaning, one stovetop and a kitchenette the size of a restroom), Shakshuka was always the easiest, cheapest way out of hunger, and as you said &#8211; It&#8217;s very good on the waistline.</p>
<p>The number of versions for this is endless. I&#8217;d contribute my 2 cents by suggesting to add a slice or two of pickled lemons (I use the ones my grandfather makes, and they&#8217;re REALLY STRONG, maybe store bought lemons would need a slice or more extra) &#8211; I add them at the end of the frying process.</p>

<p>Secondly, this particular recipe is AMAZING. I made it last night, and I&#8217;m making it again tonight so my boyfriend can try it. The flavors are perfect and I found myself savoring every bite. This is definitely a new favorite of mine!</p>

				<p>This was my first Smitten Kitchen recipe and I was NOT disappointed!  I&#8217;ve been following the blog for years.  </p>
<p>This was the first time I drove to the store, bought the ingredients, went home and started chopping peppers.  I&#8217;ve never had eggs poached in tomatoes and loved every bite.  I used 5 anaheim chilis and had some nice heat, not too much.  I loved the salty feta contrasting with the heat of the sauce and richness of the eggs, it made we wonder if I would like it with goat&#8217;s cheese and maybe some olives. Perfect with hummus and pita.  I can&#8217;t wait to try this with lemon as suggested by Or.   </p>
<p>Fyi, my husband got home late last night and I didn&#8217;t share the Shakshuka with him&#8230; it&#8217;s so good, I was hoarding it for lunch this week!  Thank you for your beautiful blog.</p>

				<p>This sounds really good!  If you&#8217;re using anaheim chiles you should try roasting them &#8212; it makes them so much better!  You can roast them in the oven like you would a red bell pepper, and skin and seed them the same way.  It really brings out the flavor and intensifies the spice a little.  As a homesick New Mexican stuck in Texas, I make something with green chiles at least once a week.</p>

				<p>This was awesome!! I only used two jalepenos because I&#8217;ve been overspicing everything recently. And I only used four eggs because we like lots of sauce. I loved it and so did my husband. I&#8217;ve been plotting all morning about who else I could make this for. Thanks!</p>

				<p>Amazing! I&#8217;ve been drooling over this dish for a few days. Finally had a chance to make it. Only change was using 2.5 serranos instead of the jalapenos or anaheim chillis as that was all I had on hand. Either that or habaneros but decided against those!<br />
Lovely lovely dish. My only concern was with serving it up &#8211; trying not to disturb the beautiful eggs was trickier than I thought! But&#8230;.thanks for posting!</p>

				<p>this recipe looks fantastic &#8212; delicious, easy and light :) i love Shakshuka, and have had many varieties of it (spinach, bell peppers, even one with chickpeas&#8230;yum) but this is very close to the &#8220;original&#8221; i&#8217;ve had (whatever that means! so many middle eastern and mediterranean dishes are very similar &#8212; i actually used to eat something very similar to Shakshuka in Italy&#8211; what makes modern Israeli cooking so interesting is that it&#8217;s quite a melting pot) and the feta sounds absolutely delicious.  as always, thanks for the inspiration! i&#8217;ll be making this for breakfast soon!!</p>

				<p>i made this last nite and it was incredible.  i used only 3 of the anaheims, but could have definitely used more, and drizzled some lemon juice on top.  my israeli friend said he grew up with this dish, but said it was absolutely fabulous on top of his mom&#8217;s malawach.  i&#8217;d love to see if you have a tried and true recipe for this fried bread, deb!</p>

				<p>Loved this recipe!  It&#8217;s easy enough for a weeknight and makes for terrific leftovers &#8212; I have been eating it all week!  I&#8217;ll second the suggestion that a healthy drizzle of lemon juice (about half of a nice juicy lemon) is needed here &#8212; it really brightens the sauce and balances out the spices.  Cheers!</p>

				<p>Hi Brit &#8212; I&#8217;d scale it back, because the eggs reheated will definitely be hard-cooked. You could, however, make the whole amount of sauce and only cook eggs in it a couple at a time.</p>

				<p>Brit, if you don&#8217;t mind the yolks being hard-cooked this actually reheats surprisingly well! Or if you accidentally hard-cook the eggs the first time around, as I often do because my whites just won&#8217;t set up, then it will be delicious cold or at room temperature the next day. It&#8217;s one of those dishes where the flavors meld together in beautiful ways the longer it sits.</p>

				<p>SO delicious! Just made it. Cooked the eggs a little more because I was nervous, but was okay with hard-cooked yolks. Also only made four because it turned out more of my eggs were cracked then I realized. LOVED the egg/sauce ratio, so for me, I&#8217;ll probably stick to it. </p>

				<p>Oh, two more things. One, I didn&#8217;t use feta (I can&#8217;t do feta with eggs, I got sick off a Greek omelet once), and I added sumac, because I&#8217;m always looking for ways to use it after buying it for your Israeli salad. So delicious!</p>

				<p>Wow, this was amazing! Way better than I expected. I&#8217;ve never poached eggs before, but they came out perfect. I was doubtful that there was enough sauce for all those eggs, but the ratio ended up being spot on. Thanks for the great recipe. I will make this again.</p>

				<p>Soooooo good! Made it for dinner last night and my husband was sceptical but wound up loving it. Served it with homemade whole wheat pita bread. I made it with 4 eggs for just the 2 of us and then reheated the small amount of sauce that was leftover in a frying pan today for my lunch and cooked 2 more eggs in it.  Mmmmmm. I think this could be a new staple for meatless dinners!</p>

				<p>To die for. We made this for our family of eight. Rave reviews all around. We WILL be making this again. And again. And again.</p>
<p>We doubled the recipe for our crew, and half our tomatoes were of the &#8220;hot&#8221; variety &#8212; the can with the added peppers. So hot tomoatos + hot anaheims&#8230; Well let&#8217;s just say it had some serious zing.</p>

				<p>I just made this, and scaled it down.  I halved the tomato sauce ingredients and used a smaller skillet.  We love eggs, so I used 4, and the whole thing worked out great.  I don&#8217;t love pitas, so we had it with naan and it was very tasty. Thanks!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m with Elizabeth, who made it tonight, just like I did.  To.Die.For.  Just like that incredibly cute baby of yours.  My meat and potatoes husband loved it too, which was shocking, but considering he likes all of the components (spicy, tomato sauce, poached eggs, feta), I figured I would give it a shot with him and see where it got me.  Well, it got me a new dish for my repertoire, and I can&#8217;t thank you enough for that.  One last thing, I did take the advice of an earlier post and just added the tomatoes and juice directly to my pot, then mashed them with my potato masher.  That worked really well, and one less dish to wash&#8230;always a bonus!  Thanks, Deb!!</p>

				<p>Hey, love the blog. Just adding some food history comments &#8211; shakshuka is a north african dish, taken back to Israel by morrocan and algerian jews when they moved over to Israel. We still make it plenty in Algeria and Morocca- if you look at Algerian cookbooks in particular you&#8217;ll see eggs used in the same way, although interestingly this is often as a sort of decoration?!</p>

				<p>My first Shakshuka was ordered in Hummus, a tiny Manhattan restaurant that resembled a kitchen filled with friendly second cousins. Not wanting to be seen as the Idaho tourist that I was, I pointed to an onomatopetic entree and said with conviction to my young waiter, &#8220;Ill have the Shakshuka tonight.&#8221;  Like all your commentators I became smitten and have made it a kitchen staple, though mine&#8217;s never as good as that first Shakshuka in Hummus.  I have been told there is controversy about whether to use garlic or onion. I am happy you don&#8217;t make me choose. I like your idea of crushing the tomatoes.  The Feta sounds so tangy, and looks so beautiful in its nest of red-orange tomato sauce with flecks of forest green verdure.</p>

				<p>I love this very much and while I don&#8217;t have a rotation of what i make weekly, this is certainly the start of one!</p>
<p>as for the origins- a friend of mine was quick to say that this is Sephardic- which means Jews of either Spanish, Moroccan or other such places that are not Eastern Europe descent. I asked another friend who is Iranian about this dish and this sounded very familiar to her as well. I think this meal is something that all middle eastern cultures share&#8230;a tomato based sauce with eggs. </p>
<p>Whatever and wherever, it&#8217;s pretty darn good.</p>

				<p>So apparently not all little hot peppers are the same. I saw cute little Jamaican hot peppers in the store and figured they&#8217;d be ok to sub in. Boy was I wrong&#8230; Those things are indeed spicy! My hubby looked them up and said they are 500 times hotter than jalapenos. Too bad he didn&#8217;t tell me this beforehand! Of course it didn&#8217;t help any that I used 5 of them!!! Anyway, we ate our spicy shakshuka with heaps of plain Balkan yogurt and it was actually quite good. Nevertheless, I think next time ill try to pay attention to the details! :)</p>

				<p>I made this last week and it was wonderful.  My girlfriend who claimed she wasn&#8217;t hungry originally said she didn&#8217;t want any, so I halved the recipe.  By the time it was done she was like &#8220;well&#8230; yeah, actually, is there enough for me?&#8221;  And, even halved, it was perfect for two.  She keeps telling people about it and calling it &#8220;shakshuki or something&#8221;  hehe.  I only used 1.5 jalapenos for the half recipe and I wish I&#8217;d used like 3, it was pretty mild.  Totally making this again.</p>

				<p>Chelsea, Nicole &#8212; I concur. 90% our ordered-in shakshuka arrives, the eggs have gotten hard-cooked in the hot sauce and we haven&#8217;t minded one bit.</p>

				<p>My partner and I just made this for dinner and it was DELICIOUS! I can&#8217;t recommend it enough. Next time, I&#8217;m going to swap out some of the Anaheims for jalapenos&#8230; love that extra kick. Thanks for the recipe!</p>

				<p>My darling husband (who has only very recently taken up cooking, due to our current situation of myself being a first year med student) made this for me and my favorite study partner last night.  Since we are currently on the food borne illness section of microbiology, he cooked the yolks completely. We scooped it all up with naan, and it was absolutely fabulous. I&#8217;m already plotting when we will make it again. The only hiccup was when my husband, who follows recipes oh-so literally, tried crushing the tomatoes by picking them up and squeezing them in his hands.  He ended up with a shirt (and kitchen) covered with tomato spray.</p>

				<p>I made it last night and it was delicious, though it had very little heat.  Did I cook the jalapenos too long?  Next time, should I add more jalapenos, add them later in the process, or maybe add heat another way (eg, cayenne powder)?</p>

				<p>I made this the other night and ate leftovers for lunch today; I certainly understand having a craving for it now.  So so good!  I didn&#8217;t have enough peppers, but certainly wanted the kick, so I added a good squirt of Vietnamese Sriracha hot sauce.  It was really yummy:)</p>

				<p>Christian &#8212; We served it right from the pot. But I don&#8217;t see why you couldn&#8217;t remove the eggs with a slotted spoon to a plate then pour the sauce into a serving bowl, slipping the eggs in after it.</p>

				<p>Andy &#8212; I find that jalapenos vary wildly in heat. Sometimes I&#8217;ll get absurdly hot ones, other times I&#8217;ll get ones that taste like bell peppers. Next time, it might be helpful to buy a couple more than you need just in case. You can nip off the end so you can taste them and see how hot they are before cooking with them, then adjust the amount you use accordingly.</p>

				<p>I made this last night and my boyfriend and I both loved it. I used 3 jalapenos and it was very spicy (this from someone who is a huge fan of spice). Ad you mentioned Deb, all jalapenos are not created equal so I guess I got some hot ones. I served the eggs and sauce in a bowl, then I put the bowl on a plate with the warm pita. It was not only a delicious dish but a very pretty one. Thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>Feeling way late to the party, but just wanted to say that I made this last night for dinner &#8211; ohmyfreakinggawd, it was good!  we used 2 very long jalapenos and it was just on the edge of being close to too hot.  I was worried about the Tbsp of paprika, but the smokiness really balanced out the acidity of the tomatoes &#8211; GORGEOUS recipe, Deb &#8211; thanks!!

				<p>Oh Deb, this is soooooooo nice! My 5-month-old and I are home sick today, it&#8217;s raining, but the Tylenol&#8217;s kicking in, the shakshuka&#8217;s simmering on the stove and things are looking up. Truth: I didn&#8217;t have any peppers, so I used a can of tomatoes with green chillies that I thought I&#8217;d never find a use for&#8230;that makes mine an an intercontinental melange, but hot diggigy&#8230;so good.</p>

				<p>I just finished making/eating this for lunch and it was great.  Just like you, I only used 4 anaheim peppers.  I think next time I will up it to 5 annaheims and maybe add part of a jalapeno?  I would like a little more spice, but it was still awesome this time.  Also, I think I will add a bit more flavor with a touch more onion (I used a half of a large onion, but will use a whole large onion next time).  Also, I only used egg white, as I have high cholesterol.  Delish!</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this!  I am always looking for creative dishes to serve my middle-eastern in-laws.  I will surprise them with it next time they are in Chicago for a visit.</p>

				<p>Coming from a Middle Eastern background (albeit a few generations back) I grew up eating this, however my mom always called it eggs and tomatoes and topped the eggs right at the end with a simple slice of munster cheese.  This version looks fabulous though and I absolutely cannot WAIT to try it.  Keep up the good work!</p>

				<p>This is unreal &#8211; I simply cannot say enough good things about it!  We added crumbled sage sausage from our farm share (perhaps a sacrilege??) and used peppercorn goat cheese&#8211; delish! I served with homemade bread and your Paul Wolfert hummus- and WAS KILLER!

<p>Also &#8211; Nicole &#8211; I always try to order my shakshuka with the eggs well done &#8211; I hate runny egg yolk.  Even with the eggs cooked a bit more, it tastes delicious to me.  And for those based in NY &#8211; the Hummus Place has a fantastic weekend brunch menu where the shakshuka is served on top of open toasted pita that absorbs all the flavors of the sauce and is just&#8230;yum.</p>

				<p>This is an amazing recipe. We had a girls night and a friend had found this blog and made this recipe. I have not found such a tasty veggie meals in years. As I am cutting out all processed foods out of my diet and living a healthier life I will still always be a foodie and after making this I found myself craving a really healthy meal. I cannot say enough how easy this was to make by following the pictures and instructions on smitten kitchen and further more have now made it myself and even my picky family members have loved this as well-I used the jalapeno option as I cook with these often and can alter the spice depending on who I am cooking for.</p>

				<p>So I am a native Israeli, and when I came across your recipe just the picture took me right back to when I used to live there.  Tonight I made this dish for my husband and myself.  He had never had it.  The consensus &#8211; he said he didn&#8217;t want the meal to end and I was brought right back to my mother&#8217;s kitchen as a little girl in Israel.  Thank you! This recipe is a keeper for sure, as is your blog!</p>

				<p>Yum!!!!  I made this last wknd for our Sabbath lunch after church.  Had a group of friends over and whipped it up in no time!  Everyone loved it!  I let the eggs cook about 5-7mins longer than your recommendation which was perfect for my friends who do not like runny eggs.  I must say that I have never used so much paprika in one dish, ever!  I panicked briefly, thinking I had interchanged the cumin and paprika measurements.  All was fine as I checked and rechecked your recipe.  We served this over cous cous with a side of asparagus and naan.  WONDERFUL!!!!</p>

				<p>I overcooked the eggs and, like you, was a little too shy with the peppers, but I still loved this dish!  The sauce is so rich, yet simple.  I can&#8217;t wait to perfect the cooking time&#8211; I can see this being a regular in the weekly rotation, for breakfast or dinner.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>Deb &#8211; made this the other night and it was phenomenal! Such a nice way to spice up a weeknight meal regimen. You always inspire me so much &#8211; I&#8217;ve made several things of yours already and I literally want to make EVERYTHING you post! </p>

<p>Hope I did you some justice :) Your food is always perfection &#8211; and my goal is to inspire other women my age to cook and try new things. Thanks for being so wonderful! xxSAS</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m trying to figure out how I could veganize this recipe. Do you think, instead of eggs, this could hold up to a tofu? I want to make this and eat the eggs, but in a separate dish, make a version for my vegan sweetie</p>

				<p>Yummy! I made it last weekend, it was great thanks! I found a lonely scallion in the fridge and chopped it fine, together with the parsley&#8230;delicious! It gave it something extra, not that it needed it, but we all loved it.</p>

				<p>I just made this tonight, and it was delicious. You know how wonderful it is to make EXACTLY what you&#8217;re craving? Tonight it was this. I took a cue from my own local hummus/shakshuka place and threw in some baby spinach to wilt in the stew before I cracked the eggs, and it was a good decision, and I recommend it if you&#8217;re looking for a variation.</p>

				<p>just made this for a weekend breakfast.  i liked it better than my bf&#8230;the eggs were &#8220;just cooked&#8221; and that turned him off a bit.  Next time I will make the base and cook the eggs separately so that everyone is happy.  Thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>i&#8217;m loving the comments section on smitten kitchen! i can read and read and read before i make a dish and get everyone&#8217;s advice! i&#8217;m trying to do my part and chime in when i&#8217;ve made some of the recipes on this, my favorite cooking blog. </p>
<p>i used a large can of chopped tomatoes that i had on hand. kept everything else the same. worked out famously and so delicious. since my husband and i are on a tight budget i imagine this will go into our regular rotation for dinner. </p>
<p>also, since there are only two of us, we felt that two eggs plus the sauce and bread would be enough for a light dinner so i poached up four eggs in the sauce. i saved the extra sauce and poached two eggs up in it the next morning for breakfast. i loved it so much for breakfast that next time i may just make the sauce some evening and store it in the refrigerator for a few days, taking out the needed sauce for breakfast&#8230; </p>
<p>finally&#8230; it is intriguing to me how heated the debate has become about where this dish is from. i posted a link to this post from my facebook page and someone posted &#8220;this is an egyptian dish.&#8221; my husband is from colombia and there are similar &#8220;this is ours&#8221; claims over several colombian dishes&#8230; guess it&#8217;s a good thing that everyone wants to claim it!</p>

				<p>I made this dish for my family (of four hungry children, and one dubious husband) tonight and expected a lackluster response.  what came out of my pan did not look nearly as delicious as your photographs, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It had just the right flavor, the perfect contrast and even my sometimes picky southern eaters ate it right up.  I&#8217;m going to have to double the recipe next time, and there will be a next time soon!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been staring at this recipe for months, and now that my mother is on vacation and I am left to fend for myself, I figured this dish seemed easy enough to whip up dinner in a short time frame&#8230; along with the fact that I miraculously had all the ingredients. I just took my first bite 5 minutes ago, and I must say that I am in LOVE! I cannot wait to come back from work tomorrow to mow down the rest of the 5 helpings.

				<p>I was at a loss as to what to make for dinner last night so gave the Smitten &#8220;quick&#8221; category a view at 4:45.  I had everything I needed &#8212; almost.  Instead of fresh Anaheims I used a don&#8217;t-even-need-to-run-to-Trader-Joe&#8217;s can of roasted green chilies.  Instead of water I used chicken stock/white wine.  This was delicious and couldn&#8217;t have been easier!  I served it with pita AND tortillas (and a sliced avocado, because in California they&#8217;re super-cheap and really delicious now).  This is a perfect I Don&#8217;t Wanna Cook Tonight dinner that got rave reviews from husband and kidlet. It&#8217;d be great with Spanish chorizo, ground lamb, whatever, but I served black beans on the side. See?  It went from Libyan/Israeli, etc. to Cuban in a flash! Thanks, Deb!</p>

				<p>I am already a fan of your earlier eggs in sauce recipe and have pulled it out a few times for my weekly &#8220;girlfest&#8221; as it&#8217;s a delicious and an inexpensive way to feed a crowd.  While pulling it up to make again tonight (as I have a vegetarian joining us), I followed the link to this version and have the feta, etc already on hand &#8211; guess I know what I&#8217;m making this round!  I also have eggplant caponata in the fridge and can&#8217;t wait to set it all out with crusty bread &#8211; yum! Not sure if that is a &#8220;proper&#8221; side dish, but should be tasty nonetheless.  Thanks for the delicious recipes!</p>

				<p>Yuuum!  I have been making this a lot since first reading the recipe here back in April.  I used spring onions this morning as had no yellow ones and it was delicious as always.  I usually use way more parsley, around half a cup, and stir it through at the end.  Added chilli oil today to bump up the spice.  It&#8217;s become my go-to brunch dish, people request it all the time.</p>

				<p>I loved your poached eggs in tomato sauce, but I guess I have a sensitive tongue because I found this too spicy! I used 1 tsp Aleppo chili flakes instead of the chili peppers, but I think I will tame the paprika a bit more when I make this again. Just thought I&#8217;d guess a head&#8217;s up to others who shy from spice and disregard the spicy in the recipe title. :)</p>

				<p>AMAZING was the word my boyfriend used. I made this for dinner last night after he mentioned to me he had something called &#8220;shoshaka&#8221; while on a weekend trip that sounded a lot like this recipe. After eating it, he even proclaimed that this is all he wants for his birthday dinner and it&#8217;s even better than the original he had! Thanks, Deb!</p>

				<p>The five of us are completely, happily full. Used four Anaheims, which left the dish mild enough four the eight year old. I also used toasted pita, but can imagine that a nice chunk of challah might be a better choice. Thank you for another trip to deliciousness!</p>

				<p>Thank you so much, Deb. I love this recipe. I keep thinking of excuses to make it. However, despite the ongoing debate about yes or no on bell peppers, I changed the chiles to green bell pepper (because I needed to use it up) and added only a tiny bit of cayenne pepper (powdered) to spice it up, because my little brother refuses to eat spicy food. So I was wondering, how much do the chiles contribute to the flavour? Am I missing something by not using chiles? I am also terrified of chopping up chiles because last time my friend did it, her hands burned for a couple of days. Obviously, the solution is to wear gloves. However, something about them still scares me. </p>
<p>My family is quickly (ha, nothing is quick once I start writing it) jumping in to insist that I tell you JUST how much everyone here loves you and your recipes (And your baby. Also, my dad points out Alex who is always helping behind the scenes.) You have gotten my 11-year old brother, who is vegetarian and pickier than&#8230; I don&#8217;t even have a comparison&#8230; to try so many new foods. We also all love Jacob. He really is alarmingly cute. Well, not alarmingly. Perhaps wonderfully. Or amazingly. Or&#8230; etc.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for all the fab recipes, and send Jacob lots of love. He is getting cuter every day, which I didn&#8217;t know was possible until now.</p>

				<p>There is no problem trying other cultures dishes and cocking it, but the problem is when you claim its your food, and taking advantage of other people&#8217;s lack of knowledge. At least when you do that try to be smart and make up a new name for it lol. Dont take it so personal I am just stating some facts.</p>

				<p>this look like what my aunt dell used to call &#8220;sichel&#8221;.. don&#8217;t know where she got that name or even it &#8220;sichel&#8221; is a real recipe..but we loved it as kids!!<br />
sometimes she would gently scramble the eggs (probably because an occasional yolk would break!)</p>

				<p>I know this is an old post, but I have to tell you that we LOVE this recipe so much. We make it about once a week, honestly. It&#8217;s the favorite dish in our house now for about 5 months running. </p>
<p>Also, the food recipes are only half the reason I visit your blog. I also come to find links to more pictures of your BEAUTIFUL baby. Oh my heavens. I want one.</p>

				<p>Just made this for lunch as I&#8217;d remembered seeing it here months ago and we had a half finished jar of TJ&#8217;s tomato sauce languishing in the fridge. Thus, I supplemented with some fresh chopped tomato and I also added a generous spoonful or two of homemade harissa since we only had 2 jalapenos. WOW! This is awesome. It is now officially in our regular circulation of recipes.</p>
<p>Also, like others mentioning similar dishes in other cultures, I had something similar while living with a family in Morocco. I think she also sprinkled some cilantro on top, used grated fresh tomatoes, and added in some vinegar or lemon juice for tart.</p>

				<p>I traveled to Israel recently.  Shaksuka is great, fast and easy.  This is a dish where it&#8217;s easy to just raid the pantry, crushed tomato, garlic powder, chili powder, crushed red pepper, cumin, salt/pepper, and eggs.  It was great.

2. this looks amazing and I&#8217;m absolutely in love with cheese, BUT, I&#8217;m not a fan at all of feta, is there a different cheese you would recommend or is there a reason you chose feta over other cheeses?  Thanks</p>

				<p>Thanks for this recipe.  I just tried it this morning, cutting ingredients pretty much in half, lots of onions, proportionately, and fresh jalapeno peppers.  It was delicious, even though I had no feta and used Monterey Jack.</p>
<p>I also added bacon, wrenching the dish away from all the posters from the Middle East and North Africa, and dropping it somewhere close to Midwestern America.</p>
<p>The dish complete with bacon was very good &#8212; what a lovely and adaptable breakfast/brunch recipe.</p>

				<p>I grew up in Israel and ate shakshuka many times as a kid. I recently started making it again and we love it as a quick dinner. I made it for brunch today, introducing some friends to this wonderful dish. Everyone loved it and I like this way better than my old shakshuka recipe. The jalapenos give it such a good kick of spice. One thing though &#8211; why use whole tomatoes if you&#8217;re just going to break them up? Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier to just buy diced or crushed tomatoes?</p>

				<p>I had shakshuka for the first time last week and was not happy that it cost $10 a serving, so I&#8217;m really glad that I found your recipe which I made tonight. Sadly I did not have any chiles on hand so will have to use them next time. Note to Shelly &#8211; I took a can of diced tomatoes and ran them through the chop cycle in my blender. It worked perfectly.</p>

				<p>Thanks for posting; this a go-to recipe now in my house.  </p>
<p>I had a Turkish friend over for dinner and when we told him the name of this dish he burst out laughing, because in Turkey (at least the region where he grew up) &#8220;shakshuka&#8221; are the syllables you say when keeping time while dancing.  He demonstrated by hopping around our kitchen a bit saying &#8220;shak-shuka!  shak-shuka!&#8221;  I guess it would be like naming a dish &#8220;cha cha cha!&#8221; or something.</p>
<p>Just some food for thought!  Don&#8217;t want to stir the origin-of-the-dish pot any further.</p>

				<p>It constantly saddens me that two of the four people in my house refuse to eat any eggs that aren&#8217;t cooked all the way through.  (Even a little bit of gel is too soft for my mother.)  And one of those two won&#8217;t eat anything remotely spicy.</p>

				<p>Seems like a lot you could do to this recipe. I added capers to get some saltiness (we were out of feta) and I made a fun Moroccan flat bread recipe from Madhur Jaffrey. In hindsight I regret not adding bit of hot sauce.</p>

				<p>Hummus Place is one of my favorite places in New York, true Israeli style! I&#8217;ve been living in Jerusalem for the year and have put myself on a shakshuka tour. It&#8217;s amazing. I&#8217;ve sat in cafes alone and had the cook teach me how he makes it step my step. My favorite here is with Bulgarian cheese and fried eggplant. The true Israeli way.</p>

				<p>Fab. I used 2 jalepenos and a pinch of crushed red peppers and it was perfect. I think 3 would have been too much for us. I was out of fresh parsley so used cilantro and it complimented perfectly. Served with swiss chard. Yum!</p>

				<p>I am enjoying a steaming bowl of this right now and it is delicious.  I have two questions that I am hoping you can help me with.  One minor and one major.  One &#8211; is there any real reason to use the whole tomatoes and hand-crush them, instead of just using canned crushed or canned diced?  Two &#8211; this is the biggie &#8211; why is it that EVERY time I poach my eggs they get all lacy and have many tendrils of cooked egg, instead of just one solid egg mass?  I have tried less bubbles, more bubbles, different liquids &#8211; always the same.  I thought for sure in the tomato mixture they would not have the tendrils all around the edge &#8211; but they still did.  What am I doing wrong?</p>

				<p>This is a fantastic dish. Ticks all the boxes and even confirmed carnivores will find very little to moan about when eating this. Noticed you cooked yours in a deep pan. I tend to cook mine in a much shallower pan or a Wok because that encourages sharing&#8230;&#8230;You just place the pan in the middle of the table and everyone rips up handfuls of bread and use the bread like a spoon. It was one of the very first meals that my wife of 21 years made me and it&#8217;s just as nice now as it was back then. Ps To the woman who complained that her daughter would not eat eggs even slightly runny a few friends have similar foibles and my answer is just to turn their eggs upside down which then cooks the egg thoroughly and leave the other eggs the right way up for them to be cooked as per</p>

				<p>Hello!<br />
You have the most wonderful blog!:)<br />
I am an Egyptian and, believe me when I say, you&#8217;re quite popular amongst us Egyptian housewives!:)<br />
I would just like to say something about this being an Israeli dish. Actually this dish originated during the Ottoman empire when Turkey controlled the region. So this dish isn&#8217;t really specifically Israeli. It&#8217;s a middle-eastern dish that was even Palestinian before being Israeli:). </p>
<p>Keep the AMAZING work up:)<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Layali.</p>

				<p>I really recommend using haloumi cheese instead of feta. It&#8217;s amazing &#8211; and usually made with sheep&#8217;s milk &#8211; which for lactose-intolerants is ideal.</p>

				<p>long time reader, first time commenter! :) i made this dish yesterday and even though i thoroughly overcooked the eggs it was so delicious, 4 of us finished the whole dish! i&#8217;m assuming i had the heat on too low when i added the eggs which meant they took forever to fully cook, which then caused the yolks to be completely hard. still, delicious. and spicy! with 2 jalapenos and 1 poblano i thought the spice was perfect. can&#8217;t wait to make it again. and again. (and again)</p>

				<p>I first ate shakshuka at Mimi&#8217;s Hummus in Queens. When I saw your recipe I knew I had to make it for my own! I made this dish with a lot of changes but kept the same basic spirit, I hope. Cubanelle peppers replaced the chiles, I used a whole head of garlic, I skipped the cheese, and fresh garden tomatoes replaced the canned tomatoes. I served the shakshuka with whole wheat roti. Your guidance helped make a very successful dinner! I wrote about it on my blog if you&#8217;re curious. Thank you so much!</p>

				<p>Please forgive me if anyone finds this offensive but using a can of Rotel as the base for this dish is pretty tasty. I sub in the Rotel for the peppers and crushed tomatoes, which is helpful in making this a more pantry friendly meal. I love making Shakshuka on the nights we are almost completely out of groceries! I also like to add a drizzle of honey and a tsp of tumeric instead of paprika ever since I read A Drizzle of Honey : The Lives and Recipes of Spain&#8217;s Secret Jews by Gitlitz and Davidson.</p>

				<p>I recently had this dish for the first time in the Fishtown section of Philly and loved it. I did my own tweaking based on what I had handy. I had a bunch of green bell peppers left from my CSA so I used them instead of the anaheims and added 3 drops of pure capsaisin for heat.  I also added turmeric, cinnamon, and a small pinch of nutmeg and cloves to the cumin and paprika. I wish I could eat cheese, but it doesn&#8217;t agree with me&#8230;I know that would have balanced the heat beautifully!  I had some left over cilantro so I chopped that up with the parsley which was great!  My husband is a big texture guy and a tough critic so I served it over brown rice.  We loved it!  It was exactly what I was hoping!  So lovely and colorful!</p>

				<p>I have been surfing the net very often in search of delicious recipies.I stopped at your site to tell you that I like the way you show how to do step by step.<br />
But I have to correct something here which is that shakshuka is not israeli but Palestinian.I have been working as journalist for a couple of years and have tasted the palestinian food which I liked very much.</p>

				<p>:) Lol. I love your comment about the name Shakshuka. It sounds so funny to me because I am Israeli and I am so used to hearing that word that it&#8217;s cool to hear what other people think about when they hear the word Shakshuka lol. Your recipe looks amazing by the way. We always make this as an after school snack, or a late Sunday breakfast. :)</p>

				<p>Great dish. I&#8217;ve been enjoying it with my Palestinian family for years.</p>
<p>after many previous posts clarifying the origins of the dish, perhaps you can edit to reflect that it is an Algerian, Tunisian or possibly Yemeni dish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakshouka" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakshouka</a></p>

				<p>I lived in Israel for a few years and this was one of my favourite dishes for breakfast! I still make it regularly back at home here in UK, my girlfriend and her son love it too!</p>
<p>The great thing about this dish is that you can twist it to your preference and it comes up trumps every time. I&#8217;ve played about with this dish a few times and even given mine an &#8216;English breakfast&#8217; twist by adding&#8230;bacon&#8230;be amazed just how well it works with the other ingredients I use!!</p>
<p>Garlic, onions, black pitted olives, courgettes, mushrooms, bacon, coriander, lemon, sugar, tinned chop tomatoes &amp; purée,dried crushed chillies&#8230;crusty bread!! Tuck in!!</p>

				<p>I made this tonight and the tomato sauce is remarkable.  Pressed for time, I pulsed two green bell peppers and two jalapenos with the onion in my food processor.  As I sauteed it, this bright green mixture mellowed out into a beautiful olive color.  It thickened the sauce quite quickly, though, so I had to add a little more water.  So delicious&#8230;thank you!</p>

				<p>the debate is so silly. croissants are originally austrian, but the french perfected them and made them famous, and no one today would say that croissants are not french. the koreans invented sushi and it spread to japan, but once again, japan made it famous, and we call sushi japanese. here in israel shakshuka is served at basically every cafe in the country and almost every tourist that comes here eats it, unlike in those other countries.  we were the ones that made it incredibly popular in our own country through jewish-arab immigrants and spread it first to western world through tourism, so like the japanese who get more tourism than the koreans, we are given the credit. food is a moving entity that evolves as is spreads. there is no such thing as a food belonging purely to one people group without roots in many others, so really whichever people group we give credit to as being the &#8220;original&#8221; is really just the last stage that we remember. who cares?</p>
<p>and as for all this &#8220;supposed to be&#8221; or &#8220;not supposed to be&#8221; with feta or bell peppers or onions or whatever, there are general trends here in israel with the dish but you&#8217;ll find interesting variations at many cafes. there&#8217;s no one right way to make it. it&#8217;s rare to find feta or any other cheese actually in the shakshuka (unless it&#8217;s another, less popular kind with spinach), but it&#8217;s often served with spreadable &#8220;white cheese&#8221; which i can&#8217;t think of a good american subsitute for (think half heavy sour cream and half cream cheese) on the side, or with tahini. also, there is almost always  bell peppers in the sauce. at falafel joints you get it inside a pita and fill it with the toppings that they have for the other sandwiches, but if you&#8217;re eating it at a cafe it&#8217;s most often served with some hearty bread.</p>

				<p>Wow, talk about memories of home! Haven&#8217;t had shakshuka since I was a little kid in Egypt visiting my tante and uncle, and used to love love love it! I am so happy to see this on here, I HAVE to try it again after too many years. I can still remember loving it. Admittedly, it wasn&#8217;t made with feta, but I think it makes a great addition,  and it seems too perfect.</p>
<p>As for whole &#8217;supposed to be thing, listen up, people! I am an impossible snob about my caesar dressing (without egg or anchovies, it&#8217;s not a caesar as far as I am concerned), and about many others things, but Middle Eastern food imo leaves plenty of wiggle room, because it&#8217;s supposed to be infinitely adaptable.</p>

				<p>I finally made this; why did it take me so long? I used three jalapenos but probably could have thrown in a fourth, smoked paprika, and sprinkled some cilantro on top in place of parsley. </p>
<p>Next time, I&#8217;m thinking of a couple of cubed avocados tossed with lime juice and cilantro instead of the feta (not that I had anything against the feta!) would make for a tasty variation (authentic or no :P). And there will definitely be a next time.</p>

				<p>I may be going out on a limb just to get pushed off here (for being blashphemous to Shakshuka), but since I am eating unprocessed foods and pita bread is out of the question for me&#8230;I am going to serve this over a perfectly seared steak for a play on steak and eggs. I am thinking of a lightly seasoned ribeye, seared in a hot cast iron skillet, then once allowed to rest, sliced with some of this DELCIOUS looking Shakshuka on top. Dinner tonight is going to be YUM. Thank you for all your wonderful recipes!</p>

				<p>I first tried Shakshuka three years ago at an Israeli-owned coffee shop near my first apartment in Old City, Philadelphia. It is wonderful there, and I have periodic cravings that require me to trek across the city. I just made this recipe tonight (with four jalapenos), and it has completely obliterated the need for me to go back and pay for this delicious dish. The recipe is simple and more delicious than I could have hoped for. My husband and I are staying away from bread right now, so the steak and eggs suggestion actually sounds great.</p>

<p>It was decadent!! My fiance said it was the best steak and eggs he has ever had! It also made for some very lovely photos, I like to take 4X6 images and write the recipes on the back and have them laminated for my recipe box. It is fun and hopefully will be passed on to someone very special one day &lt;3 Good luck!</p>

				<p>Now that winter is mostly over we are once again seeing decent peppers at the grocery store here in Alaska.  So I was able to try this recipe last night with Anaheim chiles and everything.  I&#8217;ve never had this dish before and didn&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d like it or not.  I decided it&#8217;s awesome and I&#8217;ll definitely be having it again.  I like how it&#8217;s hearty and a little spicy.  It goes down easily like a chili or stew would.  Very yummy!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been using your site as my go-to meal idea spot for a few months now, and I have to say this is my favorite so far. Absolutely delicious! I had to substitute in serrano chilis and it ended up a bit too spicy for my girlfriend. Regardless, this will be a staple from now on. Thank you!</p>

				<p>I wanted to share my shortcut &#8212; my husband was out of town and I rarely cook when he&#8217;s away (lots of salads). Last night I was sick of lettuce and craved something warm, simple &amp; comforting, but it was already pretty late. I found your recipe, ran over to Trader Joe&#8217;s just before closing and grabbed a can of their diced organic fire-roasted tomatoes with green chiles. I tossed in 4 cloves of crushed garlic and a pinch of salt, sugar, and cumin, heated it and threw 2 eggs in, topped with feta &#8212; it worked really well and was SUPER-fast. Love!!!</p>
