Let&#8217;s find out&#8230;.</p><ul><li><strong>Intestinal tract length.</strong> Carnivorous animals have intestinal tracts that are 3-6x their body length, while herbivores have intestinal tracts 10-12x their body length. Human beings have the same intestinal tract ratio as herbivores.</li><li><strong>Stomach acidity.</strong> Carnivores&#8217; stomachs are 20x more acidic than the stomachs of herbivores. Human stomach acidity matches that of herbivores.</li><li><strong>Saliva.</strong> The saliva of carnivores is acidic. The saliva of herbivores is alkaline, which helps pre-digest plant foods. Human saliva is alkaline.</li><li><strong>Shape of intestines.</strong> Carnivore bowels are smooth, shaped like a pipe, so meat passes through quickly &#8212; they don&#8217;t have bumps or pockets. Herbivore bowels are bumpy and pouch-like with lots of pockets, like a windy mountain road, so plant foods pass through slowly for optimal nutrient absorption. Human bowels have the same characteristics as those of herbivores.</li><li><strong>Fiber.</strong> Carnivores don&#8217;t require fiber to help move food through their short and smooth digestive tracts. Herbivores require dietary fiber to move food through their long and bumpy digestive tracts, to prevent the bowels from becoming clogged with rotting food. Humans have the same requirement as herbivores.</li><li><strong>Cholesterol.</strong> Cholesterol is not a problem for a carnivore&#8217;s digestive system. A carnivore such as a cat can handle a high-cholesterol diet without negative health consequences. A human cannot. Humans have zero dietary need for cholesterol because our bodies manufacture all we need. Cholesterol is only found in animal foods, never in plant foods. A plant-based diet is by definition cholesterol-free.</li><li><strong>Claws and teeth.</strong> Carnivores have claws, sharp front teeth capable of subduing prey, and no flat molars for chewing. Herbivores have no claws or sharp front teeth capable of subduing prey, but they have flat molars for chewing. Humans have the same characteristics as herbivores.</li></ul><p><strong>But aren&#8217;t humans anatomically suited to be omnivores?</strong></p><p>Nope. We don&#8217;t anatomically match up with omnivorous animals anymore than we do with carnivorous ones. Omnivores are more similar to carnivores than they are to herbivores. For a more detailed summary table that compares the properties of carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores side by side, see this page:<br /> <a href="http://www.tierversuchsgegner.org/wiki/index.php?title=Taxonomy" target="_blank">Comparative Anatomy &amp; Taxonomy</a></p><p>The link above also debunks the opportunistic feeder theory, which states that because humans <em>can</em> eat like omnivores, that we must therefore <em>be</em> omnivores. And this is of course false because mere behavior doesn&#8217;t indicate suitability. There are plenty of things we <em>can</em> do as a species that would threaten our survival if we all considered them suitable default behavior, such as shooting each other, lobbing hand grenades, or sending spam.</p><div class="noprint"><table cellspacing="5"><tr><td> <a href="http://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-count="horizontal" data-via="stevepavlina">Tweet</a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> </td></tr><tr><td> <script src="http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1"></script><fb:like></fb:like></td></tr><tr><td> <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/09/are-humans-carnivores-or-herbivores-2/email/" title="Email this article to a friend" rel="nofollow"><img class="WP-EmailIcon" src="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/wp-email/images/email_famfamfam.png" alt="Email this article to a friend" title="Email this article to a friend" style="border: 0px;" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/09/are-humans-carnivores-or-herbivores-2/email/" title="Email this article to a friend" rel="nofollow">Email this article to a friend</a></td></tr></table> <br><table><tr><td valign="top"><form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post"> <input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick"> <input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="7RSYYKY29BUN4"> <input type="image" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="Thanks, Steve"> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1"></form></td><td valign="top">If you've found this website helpful, please click the Donate button.

Humans do have sharp front teeth. Have you ever seen front teeth of a cow?</p><p>What about eyes? Eyes of a victims are usually located on sides so they can see everything around them and escape a hunter. Eyes of hunters are always located in a front so they have 3D view to know exact distance to hunt a victim.

Do you know how much nutritional education the typical doctor receives?  Even so, doctors and dieticians aren&#8217;t consistent in their advice.

And yes, human saliva is alkaline &#8211; but when you eat meat raw and warm you don&#8217;t need any saliva or chewing &#8211; you just bite and swallow.  Raw meat is easily digested and goes through your system fairly quickly, as long as you leave yourself an hour or so between a green vegetable meal and a meat one.  After I eat meat, I usually have an immediate bowel movement that clears the way for the required change in intestinal acidity.  With fruits, though, especially ones like tomatoes and citrus, there isn&#8217;t even a need to wait before consuming meat.</p><p>Most of the rest of your article is a straw man &#8211; you&#8217;re trying to imply that because humans have anatomy that&#8217;s different from other omnivores, this means we&#8217;re not omnivores.

I agree with some of your readers that this article is lacking in objectivity but not that it doesn&#8217;t present a valid argument. The information provided and the optional source don&#8217;t say either way that humans are carnivores/herbivores or  omnivores but rather that they have developed traits of both for varying reasons, dietary needs aside.</p><p>As for the vegan, raw and whole foods diet: One of the essential qualities of this life thing is the option of choice. The Vegan thing may not be for everyone, maybe you choose veg., maybe meat; there is something to be said for the dietary type theories as well.</p><p>On a personal note: Currently, I&#8217;m struggling with giving up my Polish diet (meat for breakfast, meat for lunch, and meat for supper&#8230; and some more meat for snacktime, mmmmm&#8230;..meat *arghghghghgh*) for a Vegan, raw and whole food diet. Why? Because of it&#8217;s positive effect on my mother&#8217;s health.</p><p>My mother was suffering from liver disease, high blood-pressure, high cholestoral. Her then boyfriend, who has successfully been on this diet for over 30 years proposed that she try it for a year and see what happens. She did. Nearly 6 months into her conversion she was at her doctors for some regular tests and ran into a problem. The doctor ordered retests because neither of them could believe that her liver had done a 360 and had drastically regenerated itself &#8211; to the point where it was a slightly damaged liver but not one that could be considered &#8220;diseased&#8221; (it has since regenerated almost completely). As well her blood pressure, cholestoral levels and the results of all her other tests came back that she was perfectly healthy. It&#8217;s been 2 and a half years and she&#8217;s in better health than she has ever been. (To add to this her regular excercise regime is far from demanding, she simply makes sure she walks when she can walk and keeps herself busy instead of couch/computer potatoing.)</p><p>Another effect she discovered was that she stopped taking her premrin, estrogen replacement pills and other prescription medication because she simply didn&#8217;t need them anymore. She gets regular check ups to make sure everything is on track and the doctor continues to report that she is in a high degree of health, more than is normal for a person of her age.</p><p>She has been after me to try the diet. &#8220;Just try it,&#8221; she keeps telling me. I can&#8217;t ignore it. No matter how much I love my meat I see how it&#8217;s affected other people and know that I have to try it myself to understand whether it is the correct choice for me. My doctor has studied it and offers it as a viable healthy choice along with regular excercise. Like everything you can&#8217;t deny you have to admit that there is a choice and it offers, even if only in part, potential. It is a theory but a theory that holds as much truth as a theory can.</p><p>Keep up the good work Steve!</p></li><li class="" id="comment-9446"><cite>Kevin Longshore</cite> Says: <br /><small class="commentmetadata"><a href="#comment-9446" title="">September 9th, 2005 at 10:14 am</a> </small><p>Jeremy: B-12 is also easily obtained from some fermented vegetables, see <a href="http://www.supplementwatch.com/suplib/supplement.asp?DocId=1028" rel="nofollow">http://www.supplementwatch.com/suplib/supplement.asp?DocId=1028</a> for details on B-12.

This post makes several assumptions that I don&#8217;t think are necessarily true. You are completely over simplifying the complex nature of metabolism and biosynthesis. Anatomy is such a poor indicator of evolution in biosynthetic pathways and genetic networks. There are so many reasons for varying morphology in the intestinal tract. Humans are one of the few species to walk upright for starters! LIke I said in my post from yesterday, teeth are a very poor indicator of dietary needs. Gorilla&#8217;s and Babboons have massive fangs, but they eat a pure veg diet. Humans and Chimpanzees have small incisors and they both eat large portions of meat on a regular basis. Chimpanzees actually farm Colobus monkeys, carefully killing only a specific age range to ensure that that their food source remains stable. Very similar to how we farm beef in a way. I also don&#8217;t know how you can say that carnivores don&#8217;t need fiber when both cats and dogs (and many other carnivores) prefer to fill their bellies with gobs of plants and grass after a good meal. Lastly I don&#8217;t know why we can&#8217;t get past this teeth and claws comparison. Humans have big brains and opposable thumbs that allow them to create amazing killing devices. have you ever seen a herbivore sharpen an arrow <img src='http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> ? If you have any understanding of human biology on the molecular level, and the mechanisms of molecular evolution you would not put so much stock in the anatomy of a species. In fruit fly&#8217;s there is a known mutation called &#8220;antennaepedia&#8221; , a small mutation can result in the fly growing a set of legs on top of its head. Based purely on anatomy you would expect this fly and a &#8220;normal&#8221; fly to be very different, however they are 99.999999% similar.</p><p>Steve, I love your blog and think you are an extremely insightful person. I also appreciate the fact that you will challenge basic assumptions in society. However, I don&#8217;t feel that you have the domain knowledge necessary to foster fruitful discussion when it comes to topics in complex human biology. If you focused on the ethical and environmental issues related to veganism you might be able to catalyze more positive dialog. I can&#8217;t wait until we can stop arguing about the past and focus on the present and future.</p></li><li class="" id="comment-9449"><cite>Annie</cite> Says: <br /><small class="commentmetadata"><a href="#comment-9449" title="">September 9th, 2005 at 11:03 am</a> </small><p>James says: “Just try feeding a pork chop to a cow.”</p><p>Um…cows do/did eat cow and pig and even chicken litter, that’s where mad cow (a.k.a.

The topic of &#8220;Personal Development&#8221; is great, and I haven&#8217;t found any other web sites like yours out there. I truly enjoy looking at new entries, and check for updates every morning. However, the last few entries related to diet have been quite uninteresting, and I have to agree with others when they say that you seem to quite an more open mind and a higher level of tolerance when it comes to other areas, but not when it comes to diet.</p><p>I am not vegan or vegetarian. Though I won&#8217;t disagree that it may be possible to get good nutrition even if you are vegan or vegetarian (there are great sources of protein in some vegetables, etc), I strongly believe that a good diet involves eating everything in moderation &#8211; both in terms of what you eat, and how much you eat. I respect whatever choices people have made in terms of their diet &#8211; I have no problem with you being vegan; that is completely your choice. But I do have an issue with the blog entries that seem to be coming across as &#8220;preaching&#8221; to many of us readers, especially when we disagree with your conclusion entirely. As you can see from the various links posted in the comments, there is much research that is contrary to your conclusion that humans are supposed to be herbivores.</p><p>Humans DO have omnivorous set of teeth. Observing the teeth of herbivorous animals like cows, goats, and sheep, you will find that they all ONLY have FLAT teeth, which are obviously suited for a herbivorous diet. In carnivorous animals like the lion, tiger, or leopard, you will find a set of pointed teeth i.e. suited for a carnivorous diet. However, if you analyze the set of teeth of humans, you find that we have flat teeth as well as pointed teeth, making us omnivorous. You say that &#8220;Compared to carnivores, our teeth are dull and non-threatening&#8221;. No disagreement. But at the same time, I can say that if you compare us to herbivores, UNLIKE them, we DO have SOME pointed teeth.</p><p>As far as the point about the human digestive system. The digestive system of herbivorous animals can digest ONLY vegetables. The digestive system of carnivorous animals can digest ONLY meat. But the digestive system of humans can digest both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food.</p><p>It seems that in your argument, you are only comparing humans to carnivores and stating that we are not like them. CORRECT! We are not 100% like carnivores, but please understand that we are not 100% like herbivores either. And there is no denying that. Therefore, we are omnivores. Let&#8217;s let each person figure out if they want to be 100% herbivorous, 100% omnivorous, or any level in between those two extremes <img src='http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /></p><p>And let&#8217;s please get some personal development blog entries, and not about diet. Thanks!</p></li><li class="" id="comment-9463"><cite>Mike Vargas</cite> Says: <br /><small class="commentmetadata"><a href="#comment-9463" title="">September 10th, 2005 at 12:15 am</a> </small><p>I pretty much echo the sentiments of many others.

And do you realize how many thousands of years we had two eyes in front of our heads prior to ever grasping the concept of the written word?

If you&#8217;re lactose intolerant it doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s something wrong with you. Being lactose intolerant in adulthood was the normal state for humans for most of our existence, and even today only a portion of the population can drink milk in adulthood without it making them sick. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the wikipedia:</p><p>&#8220;The normal mammalian condition is for the young to lose the ability to effectively digest milk sugar (lactose) at the end of the weaning period (a species-specific length of time usually equal to roughly 3% of lifespan). It has been established that certain human populations have undergone a mutation on chromosome 2 which results in a bypass of the normal shutdown in lactase production, allowing members of these groups to continue consumption of fresh milk and fresh milk products throughout their lives.</p><p>There is some debate on exactly where and when the mutation(s) occurred, some arguing for separate mutation events in Sweden and the Arabian Peninsula near 4000 BC which converged as they spread, while others argue for a single event in the Middle East at about 4500 BC which radiated from there. Whatever the precise origin in time and place, most modern western Eurasians and people of western Eurasian ancestry show the effects of this mutation (that is, they are able to safely consume milk products all their lives) while most modern eastern Eurasians, sub-saharan Africans and native peoples of the Americas and Pacific Islands do not (they are &#8216;lactose intolerant&#8217; as adults)&#8221;</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance</a></p></li><li class="alt" id="comment-9471"><cite><a href='http://www.stevepavlina.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Steve Pavlina</a></cite> Says: <br /><small class="commentmetadata"><a href="#comment-9471" title="">September 10th, 2005 at 8:50 am</a> </small><p>If an adult human can&#8217;t wean itself off of milk, then why switch to the milk of a whole other species?</p></li><li class="" id="comment-9475"><cite>Annie</cite> Says: <br /><small class="commentmetadata"><a href="#comment-9475" title="">September 10th, 2005 at 4:12 pm</a> </small><p>Thanks a lot steve.

But it is *NOT* because of the protein in milk, or the consumption of protein from animal sources, that calcium is leached from the bones; rather, it is the high acidity of our diets overall in the U.S.! One can eat lots of animal protein and keep acidity low simply by eating lots of green veggies along with (which I recommend). Of course, most starchy and processed carbohydrates also contribute to the acidity of our diets.</p></li><li class="alt" id="comment-9489"><cite><a href='http://www.stevepavlina.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Steve Pavlina</a></cite> Says: <br /><small class="commentmetadata"><a href="#comment-9489" title="">September 11th, 2005 at 8:30 pm</a> </small><p>@Jeremy:  Since animal products are acidifying, it seems better to simply avoid them altogether.  No need to consume something harmful in moderation by &#8220;diluting&#8221; its negative effects with veggies.  Why not skip the damage dealers, and just consume the veggies then?  This seems to work a whole lot better in the long run.</p></li><li class="" id="comment-9494"><cite>Raw Eater</cite> Says: <br /><small class="commentmetadata"><a href="#comment-9494" title="">September 12th, 2005 at 10:11 am</a> </small><p>Steve, I never said I ran down goats; I said I frequently chased them out of our yard as a teenager, likewise I chased out chickens.  If I&#8217;d been a raw eater at the time, and determined to catch and kill the animals rather than simply stop them from digging up our gardens, it wouldn&#8217;t have required very many helpers to do it.</p><p>In any case, I buy my meat at the supermarket like everybody else, and leave the killing to the experts.  For pretty much any creature to live, though, other creatures have to die, so I fail to see how it&#8217;s &#8220;unnecessary&#8221; to kill animals.</p><p>Raw animal flesh contains huge amounts of nutrients that are nearly impossible to get in any other way.  For example, consider creatine.  Sure, your body can make it from other substances, but the conversion is not &#8220;for free&#8221;; it requires other nutrients.  Eating raw meat is cheaper than creatine supplements, but it also includes lots of other vitamins, enzymes, and amino acids that get destroyed by even moderate cooking temperatures.  And few of these nutrients are available from any plant source, except by synthesis.</p><p>So, from my point of view at least, I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s possible for humans to experience their peak health possibilities without eating raw meat, making it &#8220;necessary&#8221; in my book.  It&#8217;s remarkable hubris to think that in the last half-century or so we&#8217;ve somehow become smart enough to know better what our diet should be than in the previous 2.5 million years, or to think that we can somehow synthesize everything our bodies need from synthetic foods like soy, when we still have so very little real understanding of how our bodies work.</p></li><li class="alt" id="comment-9496"><cite><a href='http://www.stevepavlina.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Steve Pavlina</a></cite> Says: <br /><small class="commentmetadata"><a href="#comment-9496" title="">September 12th, 2005 at 11:26 am</a> </small><p>@Raw Eater:  When you say, &#8220;leave the killing to the experts,&#8221; are you by any chance referring to the typical unskilled (usually illegal and financially desperate) slaughterhouse workers whose time on the job often lasts only days before they can no longer stomach it?  That&#8217;s about as &#8220;expert&#8221; as such people get.  It&#8217;s not as if the meat industry requires the same level of expertise as those who designed the gas chamber.  In fact, frequently chickens are scalded alive as their feathers are removed.</p><p>The alternative to eating animal flesh needn&#8217;t be refined soy products, btw.  Many of us just eat plants.  Nutritionally it&#8217;s a lot cheaper and simpler than eating the animals who eat plants, especially given the massive system-wide energy loss involved in eating animals for food.</p><p>My body fills its nutritional needs from plants &#8212; I don&#8217;t need to eat hair or drink blood or anything like that.</p></li><li class="" id="comment-9497"><cite>Marcus</cite> Says: <br /><small class="commentmetadata"><a href="#comment-9497" title="">September 13th, 2005 at 2:16 am</a> </small><p>Hi Steve.</p><p>reading this in the light of your last article &#8220;Awareness and resistance&#8221; has brought a grin to my face.</p><p>Ever thought about your own resistance when it comes to &#8220;meat&#8221; in people&#8217;s diet?</p><p>For starters:<br /> I do eat meat, but very little.

The survivors revealed a longitudinal increase in intakes of animal foods such as eggs, milk, fish and meat over the ten years.</p><p>¨ In the third study, nutrient intakes were compared between a sample from Okinawa Prefecture where life expectancies at birth and sixty-five were the longest in Japan, and a sample from Akita Prefecture where the life expectancies were much shorter.

I grew up in a family that farmed, hunted and fished regularly. A great many of my meals consisted of vegetables I grew myself as well as animals I either raised or hunted and directly ended the life of.  Learning to humanely dispatch as well as process for eating were part of growing up. Having turkey for Thanksgiving wasn&#8217;t a matter of thawing a bird, it was a matter of selecting one from the barn. These things were part of my parents upbringing as well and much of the rural population of their generation and many generations before them. It&#8217;s only been in the last 75-100 years or so that the eating of meat has been sourced from a grocery store. However, that&#8217;s not unique to meat. Most people have no idea where their food comes from, regardless of it&#8217;s membership in the animal or plant kingdom.</p><p>I have actually attempted to try the vegetarian experiment and hated every moment of it. I thoroughly enjoy the flavor and texture of meat. I have made choices to ensure that my omnivorous diet is chosen from the best options. As a result, we eat locally raised, grass fed bison instead of beef, etc.</p><p>I think most of the controversy here circles around whether *as a species* we are built to eat one or the other. Had the posting explored (like previous ones on this topic) mostly the &#8220;try it for yourself&#8221;, &#8220;here are the benefits of&#8221;, &#8220;experiment to find the best diet for you&#8221; etc. of eating vegetarian, there wouldn&#8217;t have been nearly as divided a response. However, by questioning humanity&#8217;s biological suitability for eating meat, you raised a much bigger issue than previous postings did.</p></li><li class="" id="comment-9525"><cite>Marcus</cite> Says: <br /><small class="commentmetadata"><a href="#comment-9525" title="">September 14th, 2005 at 6:39 am</a> </small><p>@Steve<br /> Sorry, Steve&#8230; but that:<br /> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br /> Saying that you enjoy meat too much to stop is saying that you’re addicted to it, is it not?

The typical soy-eating vegan is far from healthy. Vegans (even non-soy vegans) have not been proven to be healthier then meat eaters. In fact, most vegans sites I&#8217;ve been too have cited many studies that claim to prove how healthy veganism is but all those studies are flawed.</p><p>Vegans vs Junk food eaters &gt; vegans win.<br /> Vegans vs Soy-Vegans &gt; vegans win.<br /> Vegans vs Heavy meat eaters and milk drinkers &gt; vegans win.</p><p>But show me the studies that show that vegans vs moderate meat eaters who consume no processed foods and meat cooked only on the outside (so basically raw, but with surface bacteria mostly eliminated).</p><p>As a non-soy vegan, where would you get sufficient amounts of protein? How about Calcium? How much nuts and beans are required for myself (a 72kg male) to meet my requirements of 1,4g/lbs of bodyweight?</p><p>Heres a fun fact. I was looking at vegan options for small babies. Vegan sources said that broccoli and spinach were good sources of calcium for babies. I then checked the nutritional requirements of babies and guess what? My friends&#8217; baby who is about a year old needs 17,5dl (2,5dl / cup) of chopped broccoli to meet her minimum requirements.</p><p>Try getting a baby to eat that much broccoli in one day (spinach has less calcium). Yes, misinformation really sucks.</p><p>Now try looking at studies about soy. And I&#8217;m talking about legitimate studies published in peer-reviewed literature that is not sponsored by companies producing soy. Tell me what you discover.</p><p>On a positive note, I think its awesome that you accept comments on your blog that try to disagree with what you say. It shows some open mindedness and your achievents in personal growth alot more then many of your blog entries. But I do think its kinda bad that you only answer the comments you can easily knock out but leave the comments with good valid arguments unanswered.</p><p>It would be a fun 30-day experiment for you to eat 3 meat meals a week, or one a day or whatever you prefer, but sticking to unprocessed muscles, the most expensive, tender parts of a sheep and so forth.</p><p>P.S. I have no problems killing my own meat for eating. That said, I wouldnt go at a pack of sheep with a machine gun and then leave the rotting carcasses on the ground.
