						As part of the Born Survivors series on BBC Three, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w4gkv">Love Me, Love My Face</a> features the inspirational story of Jono Lancaster who was born with a rare genetic condition, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/physical_health/conditions/treachercollins1.shtml">Treacher Collins Syndrome</a>. This affected the way his facial bones developed and he was given up for adoption after he was born. In the programme, we follow Jono as he searches for his birth parents and sets out to prove that the syndrome doesn't define him or his life. So how has life changed for Jono since filming ended?<br /> <br />

<em>I really wanted to do the documentary <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w4gkv">Love Me, Love My Face</a> to get my face out there into the public eye, to show the world how happy someone can be regardless of who they are or what they're going through or have been through.<br /> <br />

It was filmed during a quite emotional time in my life, but I felt it was the right time to find out about my birth parents. I felt that I was ready emotionally and I had the right people around me to support me - and although it didn't go the way I'd hoped I'm so glad I can say I tried. I've had a long time to think about what happened now and all I can say is that I hope they're happy. If they change their mind in the future I'd still like to meet them, I hold no grudges.<br /> <br />

Also we're still in touch with some of the families that we met during filming and I just want to say it was a joy to meet them all. I'm so glad that they're still a part of my life, their presence fills me with loads of positive thoughts.<br /> <br />

Me and Laura are still together and going strong, in fact we had an offer on a house accepted early this year and moved in towards end of summer. We love it, although Laura needs a lot of house training. Ha ha! Mum (Jean) is glad to finally have the house to herself, some peace and quiet at last, although she misses my cooking. <br /> <br />

Recently I've been to a few weddings of my close friends which has meant plenty more stag do's with the boys, whoop whoop! The stags had their dads present and it's really got me thinking about those father bonding things that go on between father and son, and it's something I crave and something I can't wait to do. <br /> <br />

What does the future hold??? Who knows? But we're really thinking about how and when we're going to start a family. It's still such a confusing subject in my head, it's something that will take time to sort out, but it's something that we want to do somewhere down the line. Then, who knows, there may be my very own wedding to attend.<br /> <br />
 
There's one last thing I'd like to say: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w4gkv">Love Me, Love My Face</a> is part of a series of programmes called Born Survivors but I honestly don't believe I'm a survivor - just a regular guy living my life the way I want.<br /> <br />

</em>Jono Lancaster stars in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w4gkv">Love Me, Love My Face</a> 9pm, Thursday 18th November. <br /> <br />

Next week's Born Survivors documentary Can't Bully Me (9pm Thursday 25th November)explores how young people are affected when bullying forces them out of mainstream schooling. <br /> <br />

It's easy for others to look on and say your parents did the wrong thing, but then you were clearly adopted by just the right person (given the way you have turned out) as it takes a very strong person to support you through years of operations and hospital visits, as well as depression and playing up to be accepted.  You are a real credit to your mum :-)<br><br>Being Bipolar and a recovering bulimic I have some understanding of your genetic concern about having children, your fight with depression, and being stared at.  I also wish people would just ask what is so clearly on their mind.<br><br>Regardless of how stupid this world is about superficial things it is the people that really live life that make a positive difference in society.  I say that life is to be grabbed by the throat and really lived and it seems that's what you are doing and intend to continue doing.  So good luck to you and Laura for your future (she's a lucky woman) and especially for your desire to be parents, I hope everything works out for you.  I look forward to watching the documentary and trust that it will inspire people with all sorts of physical, or other, difficulties that mark them out to refuse to hide away and to get out there and grab life by the throat and live it.<br><br>Best Wishes x</p>

I can imagine the hurt an rejection you must feel with regard to your birth parents, but clearly your 'real' Mum, has given you a level of support and love that has helped make you the man you are today, and many kids, sadly don't get that from their birth parents. You are clearly much loved, and love much in return, and at the end of the day, that is the ultimate prize for all of us. Wishing you, your Mum, and Laura, all the very best.</p>

Your program was so moving, especially the phone call to the adoption agency. I suspect you have inherited your parents strong minds, but rest assured your mother at least DOES love you and not a day will go by that she doesnt think of her baby.  My Mum adopted out a child for different reasons, and she finds the guilt of giving her up extremely hard to live with, even her name can send her into depression for weeks. Strangely enough though she really doesn't want to meet her, just too painful for her to come face to face with, I suspect. It may be the same with your parents and little to do with your face. They really are missing out on having an incredibly inspirational and GORGEOUS guy in their lives! Maybe one day soon they will overcome their own fears and contact you. You will make such a lovely dad. I look forward to seeing more of you!</p>

I remembered you and Laura from This Morning and felt just like Holly did when she said she loved you both. You are a natural for TV and come across so well.  You lead such a fullfilling life, I think you would be an inspiration to people of all ages especially youngsters. You have so much natural talent and a great personality compared to so called celebrity presenters on tv just now. (BBC/ITV please note)Im sure you will achieve whatever you wish for in life.  Your lovely mum Joan is obviously proud of the wonderful son she has brought up. Although I was angry and could not understand why your biological parents would not want to meet you, I ended up feeling more sorry for them that I did for you. They probably felt inadequate then, and will be feeling worse now, as you have won the hearts of so many viewers who would be proud to have you as their son.  Good luck to you and Laura and I really hope to see you again in the future. Mxx</p>

I was bullied at school for my 'problems' but i never thought of them as problems, i thought of them as positive things. The way i lead my life is i do what i want, not what other people want. It has worked for 21yrs so far and hope it will for another 21yrs. I really hope you have the life you want and you and your gf have a happy life together with all the things you ever want.

The other evening we were having devotions around the dinner table and it had to do with accepting who you are and the way God made you and my husband asked our son if there was anything he would like to change about himself and he suggested larger hands and to be a bit taller.  I hope and pray that he will continue with that attitude.  Our son has had numerous surgeries, and just had the BAHA implant hook up and will be able to have the hearing device hooked on in a few more months.<br><br>We love our son so very much.  He is from Ukraine and it was no small fete to adopt him and now we go into NYC for surgeries, but it is so worth it all because he brings us so much joy.  What a mom you must have and what an incredible amount of love she has for you!  You are blessed indeed. We have 6 adopted children and we feel so blessed to have them, we just wouldn't want our lives to be any different. I am sure you can't even begin to imagine what you mean to your mom.<br><br>My husband and I are in our mid sixties and we are just having a most wonderful life, especially with our son with all his deformities.  Which like your girlfriend Laura, we don't even see.  We see the wonderful person and character of our son.<br><br>You have blessed me with your story and I shared some of it with our son this morning. He thought Laura was very pretty, but he was wondering if you were trying to match your hair with hers!<br><br>God bless you and may you continue to encourage and inspire others.<br><br></p>

Jono you are truly inspirational and i love everything about you as i do my own son who is 28 and has Treacher Collins Syndrome too. You look so much alike and could be twins. You've also lived and breathed so many similar triumphs in life facing adversity and moving on. Like you he wouldnt have surgery either saying his face is the way he is and if people dont like it, thats there problem. He's been bullied, done outragous things just to fit in with his peers at school and be liked.  He is one of 5 children and i call him my little rebel.  He's been through some really tough times. I love him to bits and am so proud of what he has achieved. He has a lovely girlfriend just like you and the proud Dad to a daughter &amp; son with Treacher Collins as well as a son without and taken on his partners three children as his own.  He is so good with all the children and a wonderful Dad, partner, son, Grandson, brother and Uncle.  Life is what you make it.  You've been blessed with a wonderful new family whose love for you shines so brightly.  Be happy, hope you and Laura have your own family one day.  <br>Love to you all, Jenny x x</p>

Only you guys know how tough things have been, but you have forged a path to something better.(Another saying "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" annoyingly true.) You have a positive attitude and charisma by the shedload, a magnet for all ages and sexes.(That's why your girlfriend stuck around, the 'bod' is just a bonus!)It's sad that you've gained all your insight at such personal cost, but amazing that you have shared it and given the rest of us a kick up the bum. Despite it all, bet you wouldn't swap a 'regular' life and shallow acquaintances for the real love and understanding you've found in your personal sphere and all those other lives you've touched as a force for good, by being YOU! </p>

You have confronted issues that most will never have to even imagine, and you've done so (and still are) with such consideration, kindness, empathy, wisdom, and maturity.

You are surrounded by lovely people - your mum, and Laura who is just beautiful inside and out. I am so glad you had their support through the rejection of your "parents". Having been adopted myself I know how you feel the need to meet someone who is blood related, and it must have been heart breaking for them to refuse. I have a strong feeling that if they watch the programme they will be truly ashamed, and sorry that they have missed out on a son who is brave, kind, funny, sexy ( I love your accent !) Good luck in the future ...PS I really hope you do have children, it will help to heal the pain your birth parents have caused and I think you will make great parents xxx</p>

I dont know why, but you inspired me to be whoever I am!,, Through life, people are always taught to be who they are (if that makes sense) and i've always gone with the crowd, but watching the show, it made me realise i  can be whoever and people shouldnt think anything bad of who you are.<br>I met you last night in Buzz club and i actually thought I was going to cry!
