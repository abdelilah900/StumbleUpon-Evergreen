<p>Kalles Kaviar (Swedish), Kallen M&auml;titahna (Finnish) or Kalle&rsquo;s Caviar  (English) has been an essential part of Scandinavian breakfast for 50  years. Today, many  <a href="http://www.ikea.com/">IKEA</a> stores around the world also sell  Kalle's Caviar. The tube features a drawing of the fair-haired boy Carl  about to munch down on a wafer of hardtack smeared with butter and a  pink squiggle of caviar paste. We were curious to know how many  squiggles of caviar paste are in the standard 190g tube of Kalle&rsquo;s  Caviar.</p>
<p>Being avid fans of <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/" target="_blank">Cockeyed.com</a>, 
  we thought this was a good candidate for a <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/howmuchinside.html" target="_blank">How 
  Much is Inside?</a> project!</p>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Dry Work</strong></font></p>
<p>First we gathered information from the <a href="http://www.abba.se/" target="_blank">Abba.se</a> 
  web site. Note: Abba has been around much longer than the pop band ABBA, in 
  fact the band had to ask permission to use the name. According to the <a href="http://www.abba.se/produkter/kaviar/kalle_kille.asp" target="_blank">Kalles 
  history page</a> on the Abba web site, Kalle&#8217;s Caviar was introduced in 
  1954, and the boy on the tube is Carl &quot;Calle&quot; Ameln, the son of the 
  managing director at the time. They also mentioned that a 190g tube contains 
  5 meters of caviar! Hmmm&#8230; we decided to do a mathematical exercise to 
  see if this could be right.</p>
<p>When the tube is new, the business end is sealed. To access the salty treat 
  inside, you need to remove the cap, turn it around and use the miniature citrus 
  juicer structure to pierce the foil. </p>
<p><img src="img/pierce.jpg" width="600" height="200"></p>
<p>A bit like that docking maneuver Kevin Bacon did in the movie <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Apollo13-1063184/" target="_blank">Apollo 
  13</a>.</p>
<p><img src="img/docking.jpg" width="482" height="250"></p>
<p> The resulting hole is asterisk shaped, <img src="img/hole.jpg" width="124" height="130" align="top"></p>
<p>and delivers a fluted squiggle. <img src="img/flute.jpg" width="255" height="204" align="top"></p>
<p>The diameter of a caviar squiggle varies between 8 and 10 mm. It is related 
  to the speed you draw the tube across the hardtack. Using geometry, we calculated 
  that a cylinder of 8 mm diameter caviar of assumed density 1g/cc, is only 3.78 
  meters long! Over a meter short! Picking up our slide rules, we back calculated 
  the diameter of a squiggle that would give a 5-meter per tube yield. This turns 
  out to be 6.95 mm, call it 7mm. You would have to really whip that tube across 
  your breakfast hardtack to get such a thin line.</p>
<p>The juicer structure is tapered, so if you do not fully pierce the tube, you 
  get a smaller hole, so you could make thinner squiggles. But the cap, being 
  a Swedish design, is the result of countless years of research. It is designed 
  to pierce the tube efficiently safely, and to a standard area, even if the gourmand 
  is suffering from a proper Scandinavian hangover. (Kalle&#8217;s Caviar is well 
  known as an effective hangover cure.)</p>
<p>We then checked out the familiar picture of little Calle on the tube. <img src="img/l_calle.jpg" width="123" height="125" align="top"></p>
<p>The squiggle on his hardtack looked in the range of 8 to 10 mm. We needed a 
  way to verify this, so we scanned a spent tube, which are always flattened paper 
  thin to extract the last smidgen of caviar.</p>
<p>The image was scanned at 600 dpi. <img src="img/scan.jpg" width="286" height="250" align="top"></p>
<p>We also needed a full size image of hardtack. </p>
<p>We decided to use Koulun&auml;kki for our study.<img src="img/koulunk.jpg" width="250" height="227" align="top"></p>
<p> Koulun&auml;kki is one of the most popular brands in Finland, and looks to 
  be about the same size as the one in Calle&#8217;s hand. </p>
<p>To keep crumbs out of the scanner works, we placed the hardtack in a minigrip 
  (Finnish zip-lock baggie) and scanned it at 300 dpi.</p>
<p> As you can see, the image detail is excellent.<img src="img/koulu_k.jpg" width="265" height="161" align="top"></p>
<p>We then went to work on the images.</p>
<p><img src="img/squigg_ext.jpg" width="600" height="250"></p>
<p>First the image of Calle&#8217;s breakfast was isolated, rotated and de-skewed. 
  Then it was overlaid on the hardtack image and resized to fit. Then the caviar 
  squiggle was de-selected and Calle&#8217;s buttered hardtack was deleted from 
  the layer. The result looked like a million dollar <a href="http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Roy 
  Lichtenstein</a> pop art. Hmm&#8230;&#8230; Ebay ideas&#8230; </p>
<p><img src="img/reconstruct.jpg" width="589" height="112"></p>
<p>A full size printout of the reconstructed breakfast was produced</p>
<p><img src="img/full_size.jpg" width="401" height="206"></p>
<p>(Full size on a 1024 x 768 pixel 15&quot; monitor)</p>
<p>The squiggle width was measured in 21 places, and the average was calculated 
  to be 10.43 mm. Minimum width 5mm (fast) and maximum width 15mm (slow).</p>
<p>The length of the squiggle needed to be measured so we could calculate Calle 
  squiggles per tube. After much discussion about measuring the curve length of 
  sine and fifth degree functions, we settled on direct measurement using a length 
  of solder. Solder is easy to bend, and it does not spring back when you let 
  it go.</p>
<p>Solder on the full-size printout. <img src="img/length1.jpg" width="273" height="250" align="top"></p>
<p>The solder was then pulled straight and measured. </p>
<p>It was 22.5 cm long. <img src="img/length2.jpg" width="520" height="250" align="top"></p>
<p>Armed with this information, we determined that a 190g tube of caviar would 
  make 9.8 Calle squiggles10.43 mm in diameter, enough to cover almost 10 hardtack 
  wafers. This was based on the assumption that caviar has a density of 1.0 g/cc. 
  Not having a better-equipped lab at our disposal, we decided to see how many 
  standard Calle squiggles on individual hardtack wafers could be made from a 
  190g tube of caviar.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><strong>Wet Work</strong></font></p>
<p>We needed a way to make standard Calle squiggles on the hardtack. We discussed 
  spray paint/oil, templates and stencils. </p>
<p>The final method was a half stencil. <img src="img/template.jpg" width="282" height="250" align="top"></p>
<p>The bottom edge of the Calle squiggle was traced onto a disposable plastic 
  cookie box cover when the hardtack image is pushed snug in the corner. </p>
<p>The plastic cover was then cut along the tracing. <img src="img/template_on.jpg" width="282" height="114" align="top"></p>
<p> That way, a hardtack wafer can be forced into the corner, and the caviar can 
  be applied along the stencil edge.</p>
<p><img src="img/apply.jpg" width="408" height="250"></p>
<p>It worked great! <img src="img/compare.jpg" width="303" height="250" align="top"></p>
<p>A pack of hardtack was laid out in preparation for squiggling.</p>
<p><img src="img/layout.jpg" width="343" height="250"></p>
<p>Soon we had passed the theoretical limit of 10 squiggles with plenty to spare.</p>
<p>Milking the tube for the last drops. <img src="img/roll.jpg" width="256" height="250" align="top"></p>
<p><img src="img/done.jpg" width="349" height="250"></p>
<p>A total of 16.25 squiggles were produced from a 190g tube! That&#8217;s 3.66 
  meters, very close to the 3.78 meters calculated with a diameter of 8mm. From 
  this we calculated the diameter to be 8,13mm. </p>
<p>Actual measurement (without touching caviar) was 8.24. <img src="img/squigg1.jpg" width="250" height="263" align="top"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.spaceorbit.net/peter/" target="_blank">Peter</a> <img src="img/peter.jpg" width="283" height="250" align="top"></p>
<p>and <a href="http://www.wirelessprofits.com/index.php?src=kke" target="_blank">Alex</a> 
  <img src="img/alex.jpg" width="237" height="250" align="top"></p>
<p>enjoying the rewards of research. </p>
<p>So, for a 190g tube of caviar, expect 16 servings, or enough to cover one 18 
  slice pack of hardtack if you are not so lavish.</p>
<p> Kalles Kaviar also comes in 100g (8.5 servings) and 300g (25.6 servings) tubes. &uml;</p>
