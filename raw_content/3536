		<p>I may be a die-hard Cleveland Indians fan, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll go to the ballpark just for the games. I often choose what tickets I buy based on the promotions. So far this season I&rsquo;ve bought tickets to fireworks night, half-price college ID night and dollar dog night. While I always enjoy my free flashlight or bobblehead, there have been some fan promotions that didn&rsquo;t go so well. Here&rsquo;s a look at five that failed:</p>
<p><strong><img width="144" height="179" align="right" alt="beer_320x400.jpg" src="http://www.mentalfloss.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/beer_320x400.jpg" />Cleveland Municipal Stadium, 1974</strong></p>
<p>The Promotion: <a href="http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/features/flashbacks/06_04_1974.stm">10-Cent Beer Night</a>. To bring fans to see the miserable Cleveland Indians, management decided to sell 10-ounce cups of beer for only 10 cents at a game against the Texas Rangers.</p>
<p>What went wrong: Management forgot one small detail: drunk people get restless. More than 25,000 fans showed up for the event, most of them already tipsy at the gate. Among the more tame incidents was a woman who flashed the crowd from the on-deck circle, a father-son team mooning the players (good bonding experience, I guess) and fans jumping on the field to meet shake hands with the outfielders. Then, in the bottom of the ninth, the Indians tied the game, but never got a chance to win. Fans started throwing batteries, golf balls, cups and rocks onto the field and one even took the glove of the Rangers right fielder. As the player rushed into the stands to get his glove back, fans starting swarming the field to stop him and threw chairs to block his way.</p>
<p>The Outcome: The Indians were forced to forfeit the game and nine fans were arrested. The AL president forced the franchise to abandon the promotion idea after understating &ldquo;There was no question that beer played a great part in the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cash drop night, All-you-can-eat seat night, and more bad ideas after the break.</p>
<p><span id="more-6960"></span></p>
<p><strong><img width="263" height="183" align="right" alt="disco demolition.jpg" src="http://www.mentalfloss.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/disco%20demolition.jpg" />Comiskey Park, 1979</strong></p>
<p>The Promotion: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Demolition_Night">Disco Demolition Night</a>. White Sox fans were encouraged to bring old disco records to the park in exchange for a reduced admission price of 98 cents. The records were to be destroyed in between the two games of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers.</p>
<p>What went wrong: Believe it or not, a lot of people wanted to see disco records destroyed. 50,000 people showed up at the gates and many who were turned away at the gate tried to climb the walls of the stadium to get in. The crowd, who were reportedly heavily under the influence, soon realized that records could double as Frisbees, which naturally led to fans throwing firecrackers and drinks. When the demolition moment came, the explosion was bigger than expected and ended up ripping a hole in the outfield grass. Thousands of fans ran onto the field to join the mayhem, burning banners and throwing objects. The batting cages were even destroyed in the riot.</p>
<p>The outcome: The Tigers refused to take the field, forcing the White Sox to forfeit the game. The quick patch job on the outfield left the grass uneven and players complained about it for the rest of the season.</p>
<p><strong>Dodger Stadium, 1995</strong></p>
<p>The Promotion: <a href="http://www.dodgerblues.com/content/features_moments.html#balls">Ball Night</a>. Fans entering the game were given a souvenir baseball.</p>
<p>What went wrong: Turns out baseballs are pretty convenient things to throw. In the seventh inning, fans threw balls at an opposing outfielder when he bobbled a play. The real drama happened in the bottom of the ninth, though. Dodger Raul Mondesi and manager Tommy Lasorda were ejected for arguing a strikeout call, inspiring about 200 fans to throw their promotional balls onto the field. The umps urged the Cardinals to stay on the field, but finally decided to end the game after more fans decided to contribute their gifts to the game.</p>
<p>The Outcome: The Dodgers were forced to forfeit the game, the first forfeit in the National League in 41 years.</p>
<p><strong><img width="164" height="182" align="right" alt="helicopter.jpg" src="http://www.mentalfloss.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/helicopter.jpg" />Fifth Third Ballpark, 2006</strong></p>
<p>The Promotion: <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-04-16-money-drop_x.htm">Cash Drop</a>. The West Michigan Whitecaps, Detroit&rsquo;s class-A affiliate, had a helicopter drop $1,000 in various bills from a helicopter after a game.</p>
<p>What went wrong: People love money more than they love other people. Two children were injured scrambling for the cash. A girl received a bloody lip being pushed to the ground, while a seven-year-old boy was bruised when he got trampled in the fray.</p>
<p>The Outcome: The boy was taken to the hospital, but released after treatment. The team management summed up the incident by reminding everyone that they had signed waivers.</p>
<p><strong>Dodger Stadium, 2007</strong></p>
<p>The Promotions: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18853110/">All-you-can-eat seats</a>. Undoing the work of Shaq and Cookie Monster, the Dodgers decided to promote obesity by opening up a section of all-you-can-eat seats. Although beer, ice cream and candy are still for sale, most food is just given away. Ticket prices range from $20-$40.</p>
<p>What went wrong: Not everybody can handle an open buffet of hot dogs and nachos. One Slate reporter wrote about <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2164464/pagenum/all/">his experience</a> in the seats, which predictably ended in vomit. I can only imagine that countless other fans have had their evenings end in a similar way.</p>
<p>The Outcome: Despite the upchucking, the seats remain open and usually draw between 2,000 and 4,000 fans a night. In fact, the Dodgers have declared the promotion a success and have reached the second-highest attendance in baseball. Other stadiums have contacted the Dodgers about copying the idea.</p>

			<p>The common link here &#8211; People can&#8217;t control themselves. They can&#8217;t drink in moderation, eat in moderation, refrain from throwing things, or refrain from basically rioting. The promoters need to consider just how bad human nature is when dreaming up these ideas.</p>

			<p>Hilarious! I&#8217;ve only been to a baseball game once in my life- and that was in Japan (not being American is my only good excuse). I never knew they had these kind of promotions to get fans into the stadium. I wonder who the geniuses were who came up with some of these sterling ideas&#8230;</p>
<p>All you can eat?? Like America needs that associated with a sporting event!</p>

			<p>Yeah, the Braves have also started their own all-you-can-eat seats. I see no problem with that promo. However, I do have a problem with one the Mets had when the Braves played against them: Battery Night at Shea in which the Mutts fans decided to throw their batteries at the Braves pitcher John Rocker. Good times.</p>

			<p>The Minnesota Twins have a similar deal, but the tickets are much more expensive, $100 per person.  It&#8217;s in a (public) suite with private bathrooms and multiple, large TVs.  All-you-can-eat private catering (EXCELLENT potato salad! btw), all you can drink beer or wine (hard liquor extra) from a private bar.  The higher ticket prices must have something to do with the fact that it&#8217;s a pretty sane and safe area.  You must have to have SOME sort of self-restraint to be able to afford $100 baseball game tickets. :)</p>

			<p>I have sat in the &#8220;all you can eat&#8221; seats at Dodger Stadium and its HORRIBLE! THE LINES ARE SOOOO LONG TO GET ANYTHING TO EAT AND WHEN YOU FINALLY GET TO THE FRONT THE VENDORS ARE SOOO PISSED AND ANGRY THEY ARE PRACTICALLY THROWING THE HOTDOGS AT YOU! Its funny because they throw nachos in a cup and dump the disgusting cheese in a bowl and toss it to the fans after saying, &#8220;There is a two item max!&#8221; Meaning you can only get two items at a time. Its is a sight to see but I will NEVER go experience that again! Its feels like the fans are in a pig pen and the vendors throw the trough at you! hahah &#8220;Here piggys!&#8221;</p>

			<p>Ah, I see. So inevitably what you&#8217;re trying to say is that baseball, once a proud symbol of wholesome American tradition, is now as fat, bloated and dangerous as the space taken up by the eyesore, tax-draining stadiums they play it in.</p>
<p>Good riddance to it, I say.</p>

			<p>Okay, the Dodgers didn&#8217;t just &#8220;reach&#8221; the second-highest attendance in MLB because of the promotion.  For at least a decade, they&#8217;ve been either #2 or 3 in attendance.</p>
<p>As for the seats in question, they can have them.  You&#8217;re not really in the park&#8211;try walking the concourse; the vendors ONLY serve boiled dogs, soda, nachos, and peanuts (missing out on the grilled dogs and garlic fries the rest of the park gets); and maybe six people in the outfield are there for baseball.  The one part of the Dodger experience I can do without.</p>
<p>Go Blue!</p>

			<p>the cleveland indians has basically had all you can eat seats for 5 years. In the club seats you have the &#8220;right&#8221; to have as much as you want. Doesnot include alcohol. But does include ice cream and candy. After the first visit, people eat more responsibly. So does that mean that the Cleveland Indians really have 2 items in the top 5?</p>

			<p>#5 should not be on there.  I&#8217;ve been to the all-you-can-eat section at Dodger Stadium 4 times this year  (all sold-out games) and the wait is much shorter than in the other sections where you have to pay for your food.  The limit is 4 items (of each food) per person and you get your own soda at the soda fountain (much faster).  I have not seen anyone throw food at the customers or throw up because they ate too much.  If anything, the workers are giggling at how gluttonous everyone is. Now, throw up because they&#8217;re drunk, yes.  I usually eat what I would eat if I sat in the normal seats and come out saving money, great deal IMO.</p>

			<p>#5 actually sounds like fun. Not date material, but great &#8220;get drunk, get full, and puke after the game&#8221; fun. Somebody had to be asleep at the wheel to let the &#8220;give away a baseball before the game&#8221; promotion happen.</p>

			<p>I used to usher at Busch Stadium and the most harrowing promotion was Bat Day. Give every kid a 3/4 size bat and I guarantee hilarity will ensue.</p>
<p>Best Promotion: Seat Cushion Night. One in the 80&#8242;s (Tommy Herr hit a home run to win the game) and one last year (Cards stopped a nine-game skid on the way to the Series). Both times all of the seat cushions rained onto the field when the Cardinals won. I almost wept the first time, wept the second time.</p>

			<p>#5 should be replaced by a promotion the Dodgers tried to do last year&#8230; $2 Tuesday. Some people may not remember it because it only lasted 2 Tuesdays (I was there for both). </p>
<p>Basically on Tuesday home games the admission for the general admission and bleacher sections were, you guessed it, $2.</p>
<p>Apparently this brought out the dregs of the Dodger society as a whole slew of rowdy behavior went on. The least of it was apparently everyone took the money they saved on admission and went and bought beachballs as there were easily 3-4 times the beachballs bouncing around than I have ever seen at a baseball game. Fights were breaking out everywhere in the cheap seats and you could see at least one person being escorted out per half-inning.</p>
<p>The first Tuesday one of the bleachers were rippied out in the right field pavillion (mind you those are bolted to concrete). But the clincher was the second Tuesday. About the 6th inning a couple of guys got on top of the bullpen and jumped out onto the field. They got no farther than center field before they were tackled and shackled by security. As they were being escorted out almost everyone in both pavilions started to throw their junk (bottles, cups, partially eaten Dodger Dogs, etc.) out onto the field in &#8220;protest&#8221; of security&#8217;s decision to stop the hooligans from running rampant on the field. The Dodgers almost ended up forfeiting the game as a couple of pleas  to stop came over the PA system.</p>
<p>The next day the Dodgers announced that $2 Tuesday was indefinitely put on hold.</p>
<p>I sat in the $2 section both of those games because I thought it would be an interesting experience, but the type of people it brought out I would not ever want to sit around again. I could barely watch the 2nd Tuesday as my view was constantly obstructed by people standing in anticipation of a damned beachball. People blitzed out of their gourd and exhibiting the rudest of behavior and a willingness to get into a fight at the drop of a hat despite the fact that the pavilion sections of Dodger Stadium do not sell beer.</p>
<p>It seemed like a good idea at the time to bring live baseball to the masses. The masses just are not ready for it yet.</p>

			<p>Once the Braves invited fans to come to the stadium and meet Jim (&#8220;Hey Vern&#8221;) Varney.  It turned out to be a cardboard figure of Varney.  I wasn&#8217;t there, but I understand the fans weren&#8217;t amused.</p>

			<p>Ok first of all, people have to be held accountable for their actions! Example, I went to Jamaica, on a hike in the mountains we came across a marijuana field being grown by the tribes up there, now did i want to run through it and grab handfulls like the all you can eat campaign? Yes. did I? no, because the concequences could have included being impaled by a booby trap. Just as the consequences of all you can eat can end in indigestion and missing the game. Ah yes what a novel concept, going to a baseball stadium to see the game; not to drink, not to stuff your face, not to fight, piss, annoy etc. but to enjoy a pastime. Now of course all of those aformentioned activities can coincide with your enjoyment of the game but only if your a professional fan with much experience.<br />
Seriously all sarcasm aside, one of the correlations to the complacency apparent in this country towards the major conflicts within our society in respect to foreign policy and domestic happennings remains within how we have come to identify the meaning of sports. sportsmanship has been lost in favor of revenue. Until we can get back to holding major league, baseball players, coaches, and owners accountable for their actions how can we ever consider holding someone as powerful as the president accountable for his/her blunders? Its a stretch for some I know, but for those who understand the concept of integrity perhaps you can understand.</p>

			<p>Was there for Baseball Night at Dodger Stadium in 1995.  Addition fact:  Tommy LaSorda went out to confer with the umpire, apparently to let fans know it was time to get the game underway.  On his way back to the dugou, he missed by inches being beaned with one of the free baseballs.</p>
<p>It all started when Hideo Nomo allowed a home run.  The fans in the outfield bleachers egged the fan who caught the home run fly ball to &#8220;throw it back&#8221; into the outfield in a show of disgust.  When it happened a second time, then extra balls started to appear in the outfield along with the &#8220;thrown back&#8221; ball.  After that, it was a matter of time&#8211;any misstep by the Dodgers resulted in a flurry of baseballs onto the field.  It was funny to watch, but it was also very dangerous for the players on the field, who didn&#8217;t know where the next ball might come from.</p>
<p>We knew we&#8217;d seen a one-of-a-kind event as we walked back to our cars after the game was forfeited.</p>

			<p>I remember that night in 1995. I also remember &#8220;mini bat night&#8221; where everyone was given mini bats (fortunately nothing happened, but I wasnt sitting in the pavilion section), full size bat night (in the form of a voucher for Target) and actually other ball nights. Ah, the good old days. I prefer stand-up-and-cuss-and-get-thrown-out day, which is every day I make it to a baseball game</p>

			<p>Milwaukee County Stadium had a 10Â¢ Beer Night once back in the &#8217;70s.  That, too, was a disaster.  The worst was the people who peed or threw up off the upper decks onto the lower stands.  The following year, they tried limiting the number of beers people could buy by giving each adult some coupons (4 or 6, I think) good for a 10Â¢ beer, thus limiting the number of cheap beers one could buy &#8211; theoretically.  What actually happened was that people who didn&#8217;t want beer gave or sold their coupons to those who did and wretched excess reigned again.  I don&#8217;t remember being at the first game, but I was at the second one, and I left the game with about three dozen unused coupons and a belly full of dime beer.</p>

			<p>One of the problems is that you left out minor league games, which often have hilarious promotions.

			<p>A few years ago, a local team had a &#8220;Binoculars Night&#8221;, where the management gave you a cheap&#8211; but working&#8211; pair of plastic binoculars to watch the game.  It was cool, but the thing I remember was that it was also the quietest game I ever went to, because I realized people usually don&#8217;t talk much when they&#8217;re looking through and trying to adjust a pair of binoculars!</p>

			<p>I was at a Los Angeles Laker game in the Forum where they gave out flat seat cushions to everyone in attendance. About three quarters of the way through the game, a ref made a bad call and one person threw his seat cushion. It sailed beautifully, like a frisbee, out across the enclosed stadium before curling around and back into a graceful landing on the court. There was a pause of about five seconds, during which you could palpably feel the mental gears of the fans grinding through the possibilities. Then about 17,000 fans simultaneously threw their seat cushions onto the court! It was wonderful to see! Naturally, the Lakers never again gave out seat cushions.</p>

			<p>Back in the 70&#8242;s and early the 80&#8242;s the Royals used to have Halter Top Day.  All girls and women over 14 got a free halter top.  Not a big deal but usually as the game progressed and more beer was consumed some of the braver (drunker?) women would start changing into their halters in the stands.  Needless to say this was more than a little distracting.<br />
Please bring back halter top day!</p>

			<p>Dodgers All You Can Eat Seats are the best!  Though I weigh 145, work out regularly and don&#8217;t make a habit of gorging on ballpark food.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure a lot of stadiums (including LA) have a much classier catered suite with all you can eat, like the Minnesota fan mentioned, but these are strictly pedestrian.</p>
<p>The problem with Dodger games is that the fans are mostly idiots&#8230; think &#8220;Raider Fan Lite&#8221;.</p>

			<p>The Dodgers might still have Ball Night &#8211; where everyone in attendance gets a free baseball &#8211; but they probably give them out AFTER the game now.  A few years ago in the 90s, a game between the Dodgers and Cardinals was forfeited to St. Louis after Dodger fans, enraged by a bad call from an umpire, threw the baseballs onto the field.</p>

			<p>I went to a Washington Capitals hockey game where it was puck night. The Capitals coach got into a fight and was kicked out and pucks were flying onto the ice while he was walking off. It was hilarious and scary crazy at the same time. Why give hockey fans pucks BEFORE a game?</p>

			<p>The only one of these with participants whom I would seriously look down upon is the &#8220;Disco Demolition Night&#8221;.  Those numbskulls were really nothing more than young, privileged, suburban white males who resented that there was a musical genre that united people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or creed, so they in their embittered, homophobic, misogynistic, xenophobic state locked themselves in their bedrooms, playing Kansas or Boston or whatever they felt was &#8220;acceptable&#8221;, seethed with rage at this genre that was attracting, uniting, and empowering the &#8220;wrong&#8221; element, and let their hatred stew, until one day when this one event came along that compelled them to snatch whatever records from the &#8220;evil&#8221; genre they could lay their hands on (probably stealing from their siblings&#8217; stash or shoplifting whatever they could) and destroyed those &#8220;malicious&#8221; records that represented a genre that was too egalitarian, open-minded, accepting, and uniting for their own good.  And of course since they were snotty brats, it all fell apart.</p>
<p>The rest of the list simply represents a general regression to humanity&#8217;s &#8220;id&#8221; state, something we all would have to keep in check and might be swept up with if we were in the proper frame of mind to do and weren&#8217;t vigilant enough to prevent.  But &#8220;Disco Demolition Night&#8221; represents something more consciously evil and damaging to society, so those participants are the only ones in this list whom I feel superior to.</p>
