      are sandwich cookies, squeezing a delicious white sugar paste in
      between two thin biscuits of black chalk.
      <p>Personally, I prefer the white paste portion of the cookie.</p>

      <p>In the United States, people eat Oreos by cracking open the two halves
      and scraping the white filling off with their bottom teeth. Often we are left with with a garbage can full of black
      cookie disks.</p>

      much of the cookie is delicious white cream, and how much is black chalk? On Thursday night, we decided to find out.
      <p>A 20 oz, (567 g) package retails for about US$5. Each
      package contains 51 cookies, so they are worth about a dime each.&nbsp;</p>

      Technique, twisting open the halves and removing the white mass with an
      exquisite set of Laurel Burch spreading-knifes.&nbsp;</p>
