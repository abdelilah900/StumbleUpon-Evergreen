<blockquote><b><font size="+1">SUGGESTIONS TO FOLKS NEW TO CHEESE
MAKING:</font></b> <br>
While cheese making is theoretically a <i>science</i>, we also need to
appreciate
that it is an <i>art</i>.&nbsp; Often cheese making instructions often
appear
simple, but there are skills and sensitivities which must be developed
for successful
cheese making.&nbsp; I strongly suggest that you master the following
projects <span style="font-style: italic;">in sequence</span> before
you
progress to more difficult cheeses.&nbsp; As an avid
homesteader, I strive to keep the ingredients for these recipes
relatively
easily obtained from your local supermarket and to use the equipment
commonly
found in the kitchen.
  <p>The <a href="#projects">projects are listed in order of
increasing difficulty</a> .&nbsp; You are more likely to succeed if you
work your way through each one rather than jump immediately to a more
challenging cheese. </p>
  <p><b><font size="+2">A DISCUSSION OF INGREDIENTS AND EQUIPMENT:</font></b>
  <br>
  </p>
  <center>
  <table width="94%" border="1" cellspacing="2" cols="2">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><b>INGREDIENTS:</b>
        <p><b>Milk:</b> <br>
You can use commercially purchased pasteurized homogenized cow's milk,
TB certified raw
cow's milk, goat's milk, sheep or even horse's milk.&nbsp; All will
make
cheese, each with its unique flavor.&nbsp; Cheese from unpasteurized
milk
should be cured for 2-4 months if there is <i>any</i> doubt about
pathogens
in the milk.&nbsp; If you use pasteurized milk, you may need to add a
little calcium chloride to firm up the curd (<a href="#calcium_chloride">see
below</a>).<br>
Cheese can be made from whole milk (3.5%), 2% or from skimmed
milk.&nbsp; However, remember that the richness of flavor of the cheese
is related to
the amount of butterfat in the milk.&nbsp; I do not recommend <a
 href="#powdered_milk">reconstituted powdered milk</a>.&nbsp; Let me
know if you do.&nbsp; <br>
You should&nbsp; get&nbsp; 1 to
1.5 pounds of cheese/gallon of milk. <br>
        <br>
        <b>For store-bought milk</b>, because Pasteurization removes
calcium from solution, you may need to add a small amount of <a
 name="calcium_chloride"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">calcium
chloride</span> to aid coagulation and form curd which does not fall
apart when you stir it. The desired concentration of CaCl2 is usually
specified as 0.02%. This would mean adding 3.6g CaCl2 to 5 gal of
pasteurized milk. My measurements indicate that 3.6g of crystals = ~3/4
tsp. Thus 3/4 tsp crystals/5 gal = ~0.02%. You should completely
dissolve the CaCl2 in about 1/4 cup water before adding it to the milk.
Add it slowly with thorough stirring.&nbsp; You should be able to
purchase CaCl2 at brewer's supply house.&nbsp; Also, it is the
(non-NaCl) deicer that is plant friendly.&nbsp; [You might be able to
use CaSO4 (plaster of Paris) in a highly diluted state, tho it is much
less soluble than CaCl2.]<br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="powdered_milk"></a>Reconstituted powdered milk:</b>
I have <b>not</b> had good luck using powdered milk, but have
heard some say that they have successfully used it.&nbsp; I suggest you
make friends with
a local dairy person to get bulk milk.&nbsp; (You will have better luck
getting
milk from homesteaders than with commercial operators.&nbsp; Legally,
you must purchase it as "pet milk.")<br>
        <br>
        <b>Ultrapasterurized milk:</b> This is common on the shelves in
Europe, but I find it VERY unsatisfying in taste, and, in my opinion,
this milk is nearly worthless in making basic cheese. The protein
strucure is radically altered, and calcium is chelated so that it is
unavailable for coagulation. If you have success with ultrapasterized
milk, let us know! (You CAN use it to make yogurt and labneh.)</p>
        <p><b>Starter</b>:&nbsp; <br>
Bacteria must be added to acidify the milk so that the rennet will
work,
and to aid in the curing.&nbsp; Cultured <b><a
 href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/BUTTERMILK.HTM">
buttermilk</a></b> can serve as a mesophilic starter (it likes room
temperature),
and <b><a
 href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/yogurt_making/YOGURT2000.htm">
yogurt</a></b> can serve as a thermophilic starter (it prefers warmer
temperatures).&nbsp; You can also purchase pure cultures from <a
 href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/CHEESE.HTML#links">cheese
makers
supply houses</a>. Some recipes call for addition of chemical
acids to produce acidify the milk.&nbsp; I prefer the flavor of cheese
made from bacterially acidified milk.&nbsp;
Here is a detailed <a href="Cheese_starter_culture.html">description
of bacterial
cheese starters</a> from Peter Moller. Be aware that, especially with
buttermilk, you should never add too much starter for too long a time
such that the milk has even remotely thickened before you add rennet.
With even slightly thickened milk, you will never get a <a
 href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/Fankhauser/Cheese/clean_break/Problem_getting_a_clean_break.html">
"clean break."</a><br>
        </p>
        <p><a
 href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/Rennet/Rennet.html"><b>Rennet</b>:</a>
        <br>
An enzyme rennin converts milk protein (casein) from a soluble to an
insoluble
material, causing the milk to gel (forming a clean break).&nbsp; It
will
only work well in acidified milk.&nbsp; The gelling process must be
undisturbed
to get a clean break.&nbsp; Rennet is commonly available in
supermarkets
in the pudding section, or you can purchase liquid rennet from a cheese
makers
supply house. One tablet of Junket rennet is equivalent to 20 drops of
fresh
liquid rennet.&nbsp;<br>
If you would like to try it, and have the materials available, I have
successfully prepared <a
 href="http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/Rennet/rennet_preparation.html">home
made
rennet</a> from the abomasum of a suckling kid. </p>
        </td>
        <td valign="top"><b>EQUIPMENT:</b>
        <p>Most decently equipped kitchens have the necessary
equipment:&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Heavy stainless steel pot with lid:</b>&nbsp; A
non-reactive
pot is important because the acidifying milk can dissolve
aluminum.&nbsp; Enamel pots would work as well.&nbsp; A heavy bottom is
important to evenly disperse the heat and prevent scorching.&nbsp;
Scorching affects the flavor and is a cleanup hassle.&nbsp; The size of
the pot should be large enough so that you have at least an inch of
head space above the milk.&nbsp; A cover is needed for the steps when
the milk must sit for periods of time.&nbsp; I bought a high quality
five gallon pot like this years ago (expensive).&nbsp; I have never
been sorry.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Measuring cups&nbsp;</b> You may need measuring cups
ranging
from 1/4 cup to a quart.&nbsp; Obviously you can improvise, but
accurate measurements improve your success rate.&nbsp; Measuring spoons
are occasionally needed.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Thermometer</b>&nbsp; An accurate thermometer which reads
in
the range of 32-225 F (0-100 C) is very important.&nbsp; A candy or
meat thermometer can work.&nbsp; There are several reasons that
accurate temperature is important:
the texture of the cheese depends a great deal on achieving a
temperature
to within <i>one</i> degree.&nbsp; Also, after milk for yogurt is
scalded,
it <i>must</i> be cooled to 130 F for optimum bacteria action.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Whisk</b>&nbsp; Thorough mixing of starter and rennet is
important.&nbsp; A whisk is the obvioius choice for this step. <br>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Cheese cloth":&nbsp; </span>The
purpose
of "cheese cloth" is to catch the curd and allow the whey to
drain out.&nbsp; What most people think of as "cheese cloth:" the very
wide weave flimsy material is often useless for this purpose.&nbsp; If
your curd is fine, it passes through.&nbsp; Even if it is large curd,
the curd can become enmeshed in the coarse weave.&nbsp; I use either <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">large plain white cotton handkercheifs</span>,
or
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">white non-terry </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cotton </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">dish towels</span>.&nbsp; I recommend
ignoring what is sold as "cheese cloth..."<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Cheese press</b> is required for the hard cheeses.&nbsp;
You
can purchase them for a handsome price, or <a
