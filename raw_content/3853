<p>Wilhelmina Anne was born at 11:43 pm on May 17th. (She was born via C-section, 50 hours after my water broke in the parking lot of a movie theater after seeing <em>Bridesmaids</em>.) (Which totally reminds me to write about Melissa McCarthy&#8217;s character in <em>Bridesmaids</em>.) She weighed 6 pounds, 14 ounces, and was 20.87 inches long. She is, of course, perfect! And that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve been. Thanks for your patience!</p>

				<p>Adorable 19-year-old Ashley Kauffman was separated from her skinny friends and told by an usher she was <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1375780/American-Idol-2011-Fan-told-sit-row-size.html">&#8220;too big&#8221; to sit in the front row</a> of the <em>American Idol </em>studio audience. </p>
<blockquote><p>She had been given free tickets to attend the filming of <em>American Ido</em>l and was understandably excited. But 19-year-old Ashley Kauffman&#8217;s joy soon turned to upset on being told she was &#8216;too big&#8217; to sit in the front row</p>
<p>There were two [female ushers] and one said: &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want shorts in front,&#8221; about my friend,&#8217;&#8230;Then [the usher] looked at me and said: &#8220;Oh no, you&#8217;re too big, too heavy to be in front!&#8221; To make matters worse Miss Kauffman and the two other girls were then seated in the back of the theatre rather than directly behind their other friends&#8230;</p>
<p>She added that staff had seated two girls who were &#8216;super skinny and wearing little dresses&#8217; in the front row where [she] and her friends would have been sitting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ashley says she is still going to support the contestants on the show, but is speaking out to &#8220;make sure it&#8217;s known how they treated me.&#8221; Good for you, Ashley, and I hope you get an apology&#8211;and front-row seats to the finale.</p>

				<p>Jessica has a friend who&#8217;s getting married, and she needs help with her dress!</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi there! I recently came across your blog and love it! Thank you so much for speaking up for the big girls!</p>
<p>My best friend is getting married in October and we are having a horrible time finding any actual stores that carry wedding dresses in sizes over 26. She doesn&#8217;t want to order one online and take the chance that it wont fit right (because you know, it&#8217;s bad enough you have no right to try it on in a store&#8230;when it doesn&#8217;t fit, you can&#8217;t return it). She wants to have the experience of trying a dress on in a store. She wants the fairy tale, I suppose, of walking in to a high end shop, being waited on and catered to. She wants a beautiful gown, not something my great aunt Mary wore to Easter dinner in 1983. As a women of size, people think that the size 37 on her tag means she&#8217;s willing to settle for anything.</p>
<p>After calling a few local stores and being told she&#8217;d &#8220;never find anything,&#8221; I vowed not to let this happen for her. However, after months of finding nothing, I am worried that these horrible people are right. We live in NE Ohio which is not the most progressive or fashionable part of the country. But we are willing to road trip to be able to give this awesome friend the experience she wants. Any ideas? Any and all help is much appreciated!</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope you can find a place within driving distance; if it exists, I know the BFD readers will find it! However, I think that ordering dresses online and returning the ones that don&#8217;t fit may end up having to be the solution here. That&#8217;s also what I did for my non-traditional, non-weddingy wedding, and <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2007/09/17/wedding-barbie-ii/">it worked out great</a>! For a more traditional look, Igigi has <a href="http://www.igigi.com/plus-size-bridal-collection?linkid=topmenu">lovely options</a>, and they do let you return them. Readers also offered suggestions <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2007/07/06/wedding-barbie/">here</a> a few years ago.</p>
<p>If that ends up being the case, who says your friend can&#8217;t have the fairy tale experience anyway? You can take charge of ordering and sending back dresses, so she doesn&#8217;t have to deal with any of it. Then turn your house into the dressing room&#8211;invite some friends over, set up mirrors everywhere, pour some champagne, serve some scones, fuss over her, take pictures of her in the dresses, vote on the best one. That sounds more fun to me than a bridal boutique, anyway!</p>
<p>Readers, any suggestions for boutiques and online retailers will be welcome, I&#8217;m sure. And Jessica, let us know what your friend ends up wearing!</p>

				<p>Part of my &#8220;homework&#8221; for the childbirth class we just started is to talk to people who have &#8220;had the birth experience&#8221; that I want. Of course, I have no idea. But I was hoping you would share your thoughts and birth stories with me! </p>
<p>I have friends who have had home births and hypnobirths and sexytime births, none of which is super appealing. Although I would like a doula (fingers crossed that the one we&#8217;re talking to right now has a space for us) I also want to be in a hospital near medical equipment because I think that&#8217;s where I will feel safest. Also because I am &#8220;elderly&#8221; (36) and because I enjoy modern medicine. (I am hoping it&#8217;s modern enough to involve pain medication [if I need it] without the use of needles. They&#8217;ve invented that, right? Where the medicine is just licked on by kittens?)</p>
<p>I am also told labor is very physical and hard work and all that stuff. I&#8217;m worried about physically handling labor and childbirth, particularly since I&#8217;m fat. And right now, I can barely even breathe because my uterus is crammed up against my lungs. So I&#8217;m not exactly feeling at my peak fitness at the moment, which does not boost my confidence any.  </p>
<p>Oh, and I would like a room with a jacuzzi tub. (These do exist at the hospital, by the way! My husband thinks the idea of a tub is crazy, and likes to joke that he&#8217;ll get in and start ordering cocktails while I&#8217;m having the baby. This is not actually a real representation of what he will do. But I do love water and I will take any kind of tub they have got going on.) </p>
<p>Any or all of these ideas may change as our childbirth class progresses and we learn more about our options, but that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got so far. In the meantime, if you have a good birth experience story, please share in the comments! Help me with my homework.</p>

<blockquote><p>Q. I Need Help: I submitted a question last week and so I am hoping to get lucky today. I am 52 and getting married in about six months (first), my best friend, whom I love dearly, is assuming I want her to be my matron of honor. I have not asked her because she weighs about 400 pounds. I hate myself for not wanting her to be in the wedding, because it would just break her heart. People stare at her and point as she is very short, so it looks worse (if we can say that). I feel awful, but I am just being honest. How can I handle this?</p></blockquote>
<p>She&#8217;s my best friend! And I love her! Except not really!  Here&#8217;s Prudence&#8217;s answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>A: Since you&#8217;re just being honest, I&#8217;ll be honest, too. I find your sentiments repulsive. How sad that your best friend has a best friend who actually is one of those people who would mock and stigmatize her. It&#8217;s one thing if you conclude, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m 52, so I&#8217;m a little old for matrons of honor and all that frou-frou.&#8221; It&#8217;s another if you want to exclude her because she&#8217;d ruin your wedding photos. If you&#8217;re coming to me for a polite way to tell your friend she looks appalling, you&#8217;ve come to the wrong place.</p></blockquote>

				<p>I&#8217;ve really been wanting to post something non-pregnancy related, and go through the links in my inbox, but it&#8217;s still a little chaotic around here! I&#8217;m freelancing part time, teaching full time, and moving into our new house. So a lot is going on, and I thank you for your patience while I get things sorted out. In the meantime, I&#8217;m going to stuff a few topics into this post that I&#8217;ve wanted to talk about. </p>
<p><strong>Gestational Diabetes</strong></p>
<p>I had my one-hour glucose test a few weeks ago. (I am&#8230; wait, I can&#8217;t be 31 weeks today&#8230; can I? Well, it was at week 26.) In the days leading up to the test, I was convinced that I was likely to fail it. (A lot of people fail the one-hour test even if they don&#8217;t end up with gestational diabetes.) Why was I so convinced? I guess I assumed that since I&#8217;m fat, I would probably end up having gestational diabetes. I am also very thirsty all the time and drink water constantly, which is a normal pregnancy symptom, but again, I jumped to the diabetes conclusion. And finally, I&#8217;ve been eating <em>way more sugar than usual </em>since I&#8217;ve been pregnant. I crave carbs of all kinds: fruits, breads, chocolate, donuts, pop tarts. </p>
<p>[As an aside, I used to envision that I would be a beatific model of healthy eating when I was pregnant. But I'm here to tell you, physically speaking, pregnancy sucks, and you do what you have to do to get through it. I spent a lot of time so nauseous that only a specific, limited number of foods appealed to me at all. A lot of my healthy staples (notably turkey sandwiches and tuna fish) are on the Do Not Eat or Eat More Rarely list. And most importantly, it's a tossup as to what I can stomach at any given moment. It's actually been very liberating, because if someone sees me eating a donut or whatever, whereas I might have gotten slightly defensive about it in the past, these days it's like eff you, I'm pregnant, <em>I can do what I want. </em>It's been the key to helping me really let go of food guilt. I haven't felt guilty about food for months.]</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m sure you can see where this is going: I passed the one-hour glucose test, no problem. And then I felt really dumb for all my dumb assumptions. Of course, if I <em>had </em>developed gestational diabetes, would I have blamed genetics, or blamed myself? Clearly, I should have <a href="http://wellroundedmama.blogspot.com/2010/06/exaggerating-risks-again.html">read this first</a>. The bottom line is that there is an increased risk for gestational diabetes in obese mothers, but the overall risk is still fairly low.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Loss In Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>The next pregnancy hurdle was my last OB appointment, where I discovered I&#8217;d lost 10 pounds between appointments. In fact, so far at seven+ months of pregnancy, I&#8217;m down 15 pounds from my pre-pregnancy weight. My doctor did some measurements and was very reassuring, but sent me for an ultrasound just to double check. At the ultrasound, we discovered that the baby is measuring right on schedule and is in fact in the 50th percentile for weight. Exactly, perfectly average and normal and lovely. So as long as I keep taking my prenatal vitamin and eating a varied diet (yes, I swear there are veggies and protein in there) things seem to be on the right track. Yay and yay! </p>
<p><strong>Baby Bump Question</strong></p>
<p>Even though I&#8217;m 31 (???!?) weeks pregnant, I don&#8217;t have an obvious baby bump. I mean I do have a bigger stomach and am waddling around, but the average person on the street is unlikely to assume that I&#8217;m pregnant, and certainly nobody has asked about or commented on it. I had to announce my pregnancy to my classes at the beginning of the semester, since I didn&#8217;t want them to awkwardly wonder all semester if I was pregnant. Many of my thinner friends have obvious little baby bumps; I just have a general westward expansion.</p>
<p>This has actually saved me from one thing, which is people touching my stomach. I wasn&#8217;t big on people touching my stomach before I got pregnant, and I&#8217;m certainly no more enthusiastic about it now. But this weekend I&#8217;m going to a couple of baby showers with people who know I&#8217;m pregnant and may want to touch my stomach. I really don&#8217;t want them to; in fact, I was up last night worrying about handsy relatives or my over-enthusiastic parents, and how to set appropriate boundaries with crazy Dutch people. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing this isn&#8217;t just a fat person thing, but curious to know what you guys think: did you mind people touching your belly while you were pregnant? And if you did, how did you handle it?</p>

				<p>At the urging of various relatives and friends, I&#8217;m trying to put together a baby registry for Wigburg. You wouldn&#8217;t think that this would really be a fatty thing, but it turns out that for a few items, it is! So I figured: where better to ask about this stuff than BFD, right?</p>
<p>First question: do I need and will I use a rocking chair or glider? If so, is there one that you recommend as being sturdy and comfortable? Or should I just go to the&#8230; rocking chair store&#8230;? Yeah, I have no idea.</p>
<p>Second question: baby carriers and slings. My friend Jen suggested going to Babies R&#8217; Us or what have you and trying on various types, which I think is a good idea; the other thing I know is that different babies like different carriers, and we most likely won&#8217;t know what Wigburg likes until Wigburg is here to express her preference. But is there a particular style of carrier that works or doesn&#8217;t work for a larger body?</p>
<p>And final question: diaper bags. I tend to like a messenger bag with a long strap, but occasionally when I order messenger bags, the straps aren&#8217;t long enough. anyone have one you like that has a nice long strap?</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s anything else that you&#8217;ve found to be a baby essential, fat-related or not, let me know! It&#8217;s a little overwhelming to stare at 20 different subcategories of baby stuff and figure out where to begin. Thanks in advance for your input!  </p>

				<p>Every time I drive around to Los Angeles, especially around the holidays, I&#8217;m inundated with billboards advertising lap band surgery. I guess the home of the Hollywood culture of thin chic is the perfect market for that sort of thing. But whenever I see the billboards, I think of my friend Sony, who had the band put in nine years ago and has regretted it as long as I&#8217;ve known her. Finally, once she started having certain complications, the insurance company agreed to pay for its removal.  She&#8217;s written about her experience with the lap band <a href="http://srb.livejournal.com/775708.html">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The first year was pretty good.  I lost about 50 pounds.  I had a few issues, but nothing major and overall I felt great.  I was losing weight slowly, with minimal frustration, and basking in the compliments and goodwill of people who were trying to be supportive.  </p>
<p>The second year was not great.  I plateaued for several months, then went in to get my band tightened, but it tightened so much that I couldn&#8217;t swallow my own spit and I had to go get it untightened in the ER in the middle of the night.  It was downhill from there.  I never found the sweet spot between feeling satiated on smaller amounts of food but not throwing up constantly.  Some people with the band do, but long term statistics indicate that the number of people who do is closer to 10 percent of all the people who have the surgery.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Success&#8221; is something everyone should be aware when it comes to weight loss, and weight loss surgeries.  For the marketing collateral they claim 60-80% &#8220;success&#8221; &#8211; but depending on what you&#8217;re reading they will define it as some small percent of body mass lost and/or limit the time to a couple of years.  There aren&#8217;t a lot of ten year follow ups, and they never do the math to include the people who died from the surgeries in their failures either. </p>
<p>So.  No happy middle ground with the band for me.  In years two and three the weight started coming back, even though I was following all the rules, getting my band adjusted, and exercising as regularly as I could.  For the past six years or so I have weighed exactly what I did when I had the surgery.  </p>
<p>The day to day reality of living with this is that I eat in a completely disordered way, I eat much less healthy, fresh food than I would like (or ever did pre-op), I&#8217;m tired all the time, I&#8217;m cold all the time, I vomit several times a day most days, and I get horrible reflux if I try to sleep on my back or my stomach or my left side.  In the last few months there has been blood present a few times when I was vomiting, which finally vaulted the need to have this thing out from elective to emergency as far as the insurance company is concerned. </p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, this is only one person&#8217;s experience. But as long as there are all those billboards touting the surgery as an easy way to get thin quickly, I think it&#8217;s worth sharing the stuff that they&#8217;ll never put on a billboard. </p>

				<p>Hi everyone out there in BFD land! I certainly have missed you. And how has everyone been? Do we have stuff to catch up on or <em>what?</em>  I guess I should first explain why I went away so abruptly and without explanation. Well, it&#8217;s Wigburg&#8217;s fault. Wigburg, who is currently, even as I type this, kicking me in the bladder. Yes, I&#8217;m pregnant! 25 weeks tomorrow.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the thing: I got really really really really really really sick. I wish I could convey to you how incapacitated I was. I was so sick that I could barely function. Just to get to work and home again was all I could do, for many weeks. Looking at a computer screen made me nauseous, so I didn&#8217;t reply to emails (my inbox is still stuffed) or moderate comments or post to the blog. Other things that made me throw up included eating, not eating, thinking about eating, moving around, looking at things, and talking (which made lecturing fun, let me tell you). At one point I was driving to campus and in the middle of the faculty parking lot I had to slam on the brakes, open the door, and puke on the concrete. Then I had to go brush my teeth and give a lecture. That was a fun day.</p>
<p>I got so sick, in fact, that I&#8217;m actually still a little sick. (It&#8217;s supposed to go away at 16 weeks. This in my case was <em>a terrible lie.)</em> It&#8217;s just that when I got to the point where I couldn&#8217;t leave my bed and was in fact doing nothing but curling up in the fetal position while occasionally projectile vomiting, I finally got some Zofran, an anti-emetic that I probably should have asked for <em>weeks </em>before I did. But in the meantime I was busy trying every remedy under the sun, from Vitamin B6 and Unisom to special Sri Lankan ginger cookies procured by a friend. And I was busy puking! Let&#8217;s not forget the puking.</p>
<p>In the meantime, and in addition, we bought a house! (I know. Lots of news from these here parts.) It&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16539699@N00/sets/72157625608258889/with/5318773628/">fixer-upper</a>, and we&#8217;ve been working on fixing it up. That&#8217;s also been taking a lot of time. Add in teaching and traveling for the holidays, and there you have it. Where I&#8217;ve been.</p>
<p>The thing is, I have a lot of stuff I want to post about. We never talked about important things like <em>Huge </em>being cancelled (nooooooo!!!) (still sad) or the Harry Potter Theme Park <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/100567/harry-potter-roller-coaster-makes-space-for-fat-muggles.html">adding fat-people seats to their ride</a> just in time for me not to be able to ride roller coasters. Plus, now there&#8217;s all this <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2009/09/11/plus-sized-and-pregnant/">fat and pregnant</a> stuff to talk about, such as the fact that I still don&#8217;t really look pregnant and what that means (in fact, so far I&#8217;ve lost 15 pounds, even though none of my pants fit), or the fact that Wigburg is a girl, and that I need advice from all of you about how to help her grow up feminist and confident and awesome. And also, the fact that none of my bras fit, because apparently no matter how big your boobs are, <em>they can still get bigger.</em> Scientific fact.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to commit to posting every day quite yet, but I will commit to at least one post per week, and see how that goes. I will also try not to turn into a mommyblog. But you know. There might be more mommyblog-esque content here and there. Once again: it&#8217;s Wigburg&#8217;s fault. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve all read plenty about the TSA furor, which has been upsetting plenty of people. Friend of the blog Aych <a href="http://swampwalker.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/opting-out-at-iad-i-was-enhanced/">has written about her experience</a>, and posts written by and about <a href="http://pncminnesota.wordpress.com/2010/11/08/rape-survivor-devasted-by-tsa-enhanced-pat-down/">rape survivors</a> have added additional layers of horror to the whole thing&#8212;and have suggested that the purpose of the pat downs is not actually to search people, but to embarrass them into choosing the scanners instead. </p>
<p>So I was reading <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_thelookout/20101122/ts_yblog_thelookout/more-tsa-horror-stories-emerge-while-agency-ponders-what-to-do">this article</a> about how the TSA agents don&#8217;t like the patdowns any more than airline passengers do, and what&#8217;s one of their complaints? Of course. Fat people.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is not comfortable to come to work knowing full well that my hands will be feeling another man&#8217;s private parts, their butt, their inner thigh,&#8221; wrote one male agent. <strong>Even worse is having to try and feel inside the flab rolls of obese passengers,</strong> and we seem to get a lot of obese passengers! </p></blockquote>
<p>Well gee, I&#8217;m really sorry my &#8220;flab rolls&#8221; are making you uncomfortable <em>while you are groping my private parts in public.</em> Obviously I should fall in line and just go for the option where my naked body gets projected on a screen for you instead. </p>

				<p><a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Victoria-Dress_1_purplepaisley1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3453 alignleft" title="Victoria Dress_1_purplepaisley" src="http://www.bfdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Victoria-Dress_1_purplepaisley1.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="351" /></a>Well, would you look at that, it&#8217;s suddenly the week of Thanksgiving here in the US. You know what that means, right? Parties. Dress ups. Cocktail hours. Company shindigs.</p>
<p>And the downside to all of that glam? The family gathering.</p>
<p>Some of us are lucky enough to have happy families, supportive and warm loving families that do not thrive on dysfunction and backstabbing (and to you I say: what&#8217;s that like? And also, can I pet your unicorn sometime?) but I for one do not. It&#8217;s totally the wrong response, but I find that I do much better mentally if I am wearing something that I absolutely love and that I know <strong>looks fabulous on me.</strong> Pants that pull or shirts that pucker are not allowed! To risk the chance of absent-mindedly plucking at your clothing in a way that would be misinterpreted as weakness or insecurity will certainly give some well-meaning relative an opening to corner you just to remind you that you have such a pretty face if only you&#8217;d do something about &#8211;you know. UGH!</p>
<p>For instance, I fell in love with this <a href="http://www.swakdesigns.com">SWAKDesigns</a> <a href="http://www.swakdesigns.com/p-730-victoria-plus-size-dress.aspx">purple paisley number</a> before it was even out and have been wearing the hell out of it for weeks*. I love it and it makes me feel like I can take on the world, even when I wear it to work with a modesty cami and a boring cardigan to deal with our unpredictable office environment.  And while I was in San Francisco two weeks ago, I stopped into the <a href="http://www.igigi.com">Igigi</a> office to chat with a friend and was literally stopped dead in my tracks when I spotted the <a href="http://www.igigi.com/plus-size-new-arrivals/donna-corset-top-in-jade.html">Donna Corset Top</a> hanging near their work area. Sexy and powerful and enough to give even Aunt Betty pause. I ended up being very crass and turning a social visit into a shopping one, but I was powerless to resist buying the <a href="http://www.igigi.com/moda-italiana-coat.html">Moda Italiana</a>*: the wool is seriously like buttah. Clearly I&#8217;m not the only one who loves it, as they are nearly sold out but the <a href="http://www.igigi.com/c-est-magnifique-maxi-coat.html">maxi coat</a> is exactly the same indescribably baby soft wool and also gorgeous.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also keeping an eye on this <a href="http://www.lucielu.com/product-p/tatumdresstribecaprint.htm">cute sweater dress</a> from <a href="http://www.lucielu.com">Lucie Lu</a> and I must have purple on the brain, because I keep wandering back to gaze at this <a href="http://www.kiyonna.com/plus-size-clothing/Dresses/11102207">wrap dress</a> from <a href="http://www.kiyonna.com">Kiyonna</a>. And anyone who haunts <a href="http://www.fatshionista.com">Fatshionista</a> already knows about the English score ASOS Curve but <a href="http://us.asos.com/Asos/Asos-Curve-Exclusive-Sequin-Jewel-Embellished-Dress/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=1137503&amp;cid=9577&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=2&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Black">this dress</a> is either totally rock star or tragically marred by that fat girl dress shop need to slap shiny stuff on everything. My instinct is that it&#8217;s saved by the blend of sapphire and black.</p>
<p>What about you? What are your power outfits? Where should we be shopping for our next It Girl dress?</p>
<p><em>*This post is totally unbiased and was not compensated. Both the SWAK dress and the Igigi coat were my purchases and neither company requested a review. Additionally, neither I nor BFD received compensation or requests from LucieLu, Kiyonna or ASOS.</em></p>

				<p>There are two new Uwe Boll films coming out: one is a documentary on Auschwitz and the other? I am <a href="http://theflickcast.com/2010/11/10/uwe-bolls-newest-masterpiece-blubberella-gets-a-trailer/">not making this up</a>: &#8220;a film about an overweight half-vampire who takes her hungry vengeance out on Hitler and his band of Nazis.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll love the title.</p>
<p>Without further delay, I give you the official trailer for <strong><em>Blubberella</em></strong>.</p>
<p>(Safe for work but probably not safe for potential body image triggers)</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="350" height="300" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Mt-DOdPLMLI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="350" height="300" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Mt-DOdPLMLI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p><a href="http://io9.com/5672893/uwe-boll-makes-blubberella-++-the-first-female-fat-superhero">Io9</a> called it &#8220;ridiculously offensive fatsploitation&#8221; and judging from its tagline (&#8220;She will kick major ass &#8211; with her major ass&#8221;) it&#8217;s hard to disagree.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering who the cute-as-sin actor is in the title role, it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lindsayhollister.net/">Lindsay Hollister</a> who you may remember from <strong>Joan of Arcaia</strong> and the dance scene in <strong>Get Smart</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that she is still listing the film on her resume as &#8220;Untitled Spoof Movie&#8221;.  She had this to say in an interview over on <a href="http://www.bigfatblog.com/node/1310">Big Fat Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What challenges have you faced in your career due to your size?</strong></p>
<p>I am definitely bigger than a size 10 and have lost out on several big  parts because I&#8217;ve been too fat to play the &#8220;fat woman&#8221;. Don&#8217;t get me  wrong, I am grateful. My career began because of my size (playing an  overweight student on <em>Boston Public</em>), and I&#8217;ve been able to play some amazing roles because I am a character actress. But I&#8217;ve also hit a lot of walls because compared to the average size of  an actress in Hollywood (size 0/2), I&#8217;m gigantic! It&#8217;s a double edge  sword and I think that networks/producers just don&#8217;t want to take the  chance on me. Like casting me as a love interest for example. Again,  they play it safe with an actress who is a size 10 or 12. It&#8217;s  frustrating because I don&#8217;t understand why they wouldn&#8217;t want to shake  it up a little bit. Make a statement. I think people would watch. And <em>love</em> it!</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Blubberella</strong> is definitely a statement, Lindsay. As is that hot corset number. I&#8217;m going to focus on that instead of the food jokes, m&#8217;kay?</p>
<p>But this brings about another question: Boll is claiming to have the first supersize superhero (which, <a href="http://comicbook.com/blog/2009/01/03/top-10-fat-superheroes/">no</a>). I somehow doubt that Blubberella will represent the hope of the fatosphere quite the same as the X-Men&#8217;s Storm or John Stewart from the Green Lantern are role models as black superheroes.  In fact, I think if I had to pick from the options offered, I&#8217;d exchange Blubberella for <a href="http://www.myspace.com/fatmommasuperhero">Fat Momma</a>, doughnuts and all.</p>

				<p>Remember back when Glamour had the <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2009/08/26/nina-garcia-youre-my-only-hope/">Girl on the Bottom of Page 194</a> Lizzie Miller? It seems that we take two steps forward and three steps back when it comes to the glossies. Witness this latest post on <a href="http://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/dating-blog/overweight-couples-on-television">Marie Claire&#8217;s sex and love blog</a>, straight (and apparently without being vetted by a sane editor) from the mouth of Maura Kelly, who objects to the new fat people tv shows like <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2010/05/05/new-show-mike-molly/">Mike and Molly</a> and <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2010/06/10/huge-new-show-starring-nikki-blonsky/">Huge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’d be grossed out if I had to watch two characters with rolls and rolls of fat kissing each other … because I’d be grossed out if I had to watch them doing anything. To be brutally honest, even in real life, I find it aesthetically displeasing to watch a very, very fat person simply walk across a room — just like I’d find it distressing if I saw a very drunk person stumbling across a bar or a heroine addict slumping in a chair.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, before you get upset about this, you should know that Kelly insists that she doesn&#8217;t hate fat people, and in fact, has some friends who are pudgy, so really, it&#8217;s because she cares so much about our health. Oh, ok then! She also offers the advice that if we exercised more and ate whole foods, we&#8217;d lose weight in a jiffy.  Fat people never do any of those things! <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/maurakellyblog">Maura Kelly </a>saves the day! As usual, my hardcore crush Lesley <a href="http://www.fatshionista.com/cms/index.php?option=com_mojo&amp;Itemid=69&amp;p=579">nails it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;you’re not required to find all fat people attractive, certainly, but Kelly’s comments above are dehumanizing and offensive and really have no place associated with a widely-read publication such as <em>Marie Claire</em>. This is not simply because their candor subverts the standard feel-good ladymag message of “Love yourself! (But not too much!)” but because sentiments like those expressed in Kelly’s post are bad for everyone: they make fat people feel terrible about themselves, and they make thin people terrified of becoming one of those disgusting fatties they so revile.</p></blockquote>
<p>After reading Ms. Kelly&#8217;s blurb on <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~csrc/students/careers/stories/kelly.html">her alumni website</a>, I was most struck by this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>She struggled with anorexia growing up and credits the psychologists who worked with her for helping her to overcome the disorder. She was so thankful to her psychologists that she decided to major in psychology at Dartmouth so she could one day help others in the same way. Upon graduation, Kelly reread <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> and decided that being a psychologist no longer appealed to her and what she really wanted to do was write a book that would &#8220;make people feel less alone in the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>After reading the comments on the Marie Claire blog (seriously, go read them and cheer), I feel bad for Kelly. Her sizist screed against fat has obviously more to do with her own eating disorder (which she wrote about and examined in depth in this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/books/chapter-going-hungry.html">NYTimes article</a>) and<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder"> body dysmorphia</a> than any actual concern for the health and welfare of her common man.  Check out <a href="http://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/advice/tips/lies-men-should-tell">her anecdote </a>where  man told her that she looked &#8220;athletic&#8221; and she mentally twisted it into being called fat. Also, I&#8217;m absolutely betting that the next time she bumps into <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2009/11/23/marie-claires-got-a-pet-plus-size-columnist/">Marie Claire&#8217;s pet plus-sized columnist Ashley Falcon</a> in the elevator, it&#8217;s going to be awwwwkward!</p>
<p>Good luck with that making &#8220;people feel less alone in the world&#8221; thing, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Maura-Kelly/191007784117">Maura</a>! You certainly have bonded the fatosphere in outrage and disbelief.</p>

				<p>A Sunday morning ritual at Casa Bix involves a cup of coffee, the New York Times and a pug in my lap and Food Network on the TV, where Esteban and I provide a running MST3K commentary on <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2008/05/11/guess-what-995-out-of-100-beautiful-people-have-in-common/">Sandra Lee</a> and <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2007/10/12/is-rachael-ray-evil/">Rachael Ray</a>. We love Ina the most, mostly because unlike several TV chefs, her recipes actually taste good whereas recipes from Rachael Ray and <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2008/02/14/if-you-have-a-crush-on-alton-brown-avert-your-eyes/">Alton Brown</a> are hit or miss. And I freely admit that I have some fat girl bias, but I am pretty sure that my preference for Ina has to do with her recipes turning out well in my own kitchen versus any contention that the only good cook is a fat cook. Check out the fat bias in <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/ct-met-kass-1022-20101022,0,417263.column">this editorial</a> from Matt Kass at the Chicago Tribune:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cooks require heft,  to prove they eat their own creations&#8230;.It&#8217;s not just the skinny women chefs. I don&#8217;t trust skinny male chefs  either, especially if they&#8217;re dressed like teenage vampires in  <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2008/07/02/how-do-girls-develop-body-image/">&#8220;Twilight&#8221;</a> with their skinny black jeans and tight T-shirts and ample  hair product. When I think of a chef I can trust, I think of cooks with gravitas, some  weight on their bones, women who clearly are no strangers to the knife  and fork.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before you start thinking about this being a win for fat acceptance, think again: I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s disregarding <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2010/10/04/beth-ditto-on-the-runway/">Beth Ditto</a> on the <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2010/09/03/fatshion-on-last-nights-project-runway/">runway</a> because she&#8217;s over size 12 or disregarding <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2009/10/07/celebrity-fat-club/">Padma Lakshmi</a> because she&#8217;s <em>under</em> size 12, it&#8217;s still sizism no matter how you slice it.  Sure, fats are getting the positive assumption that  they are more competent when it comes to food, but it&#8217;s just as damaging as assuming an athlete is stupid or a gay person is <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2010/09/20/tim-gunn-is-a-national-treasure/">good with fashion</a>. And the assumption that you&#8217;re such a good chef that you can&#8217;t stop eating your own creations is insulting at best, not to mention the bad reasoning that fat OR thin chefs are only eating their own food. Certainly, we can point to some anecdotal evidence to support the stereotype of a great chef at a higher BMI but we can just as easily point out situations to the opposite. For every <a href="../2009/04/23/gwyneths-only-fat-friend/">Mario Batali</a>, there&#8217;s a Grant Achatz who is amazing in the kitchen (trust me, the man&#8217;s food is perfection)!</p>
<p>What do you guys think? Do you distrust thin chefs? The comments are dying for some juicy morsels!</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/italykirstie.jpg"><img src="http://www.bfdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/italykirstie.jpg" alt="" title="italykirstie" width="412" height="306" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3421" /></a>1. Kirstie Alley&#8217;s new &#8220;weight loss program&#8221; <a href="http://www.nationalenquirer.com/kirstie_alley_weight_loss_lies/celebrity/69479">is probably based on lies</a>, according to the ever-reliable <em>National Enquirer. </em>(Hey, they were right about John Edwards.) (Note: the article uses slightly fat-phobic language.)</p>
<blockquote><p>[Alley] recently bragged on her Twitter site that she&#8217;s lost 50 pounds with exercise and her Organic Liaison weight-loss program.  But those close to her say she&#8217;s lost barely half that weight and that there&#8217;s no way she&#8217;s down to 180 pounds!</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, a photo taken on Sept. 29&#8230;shows that the plus-size actress hasn&#8217;t lost nearly as much as she claims&#8230; The struggling star &#8220;has been goosing her weight-loss numbers&#8221; &#8211; insisting she&#8217;s dropped 50 pounds, when it&#8217;s more like 25&#8230;</p>
<p>In September, while in Italy, she tweeted that she had lost 50 pounds, posting a photo of herself surrounded by handsome men.  But the picture appeared to be air-brushed to make Kirstie look thin, and she hid her lower body behind one of the hunky men. </p></blockquote>
<p>As if weight-loss programs aren&#8217;t enough of a scam, hers doesn&#8217;t even <em>temporarily </em>work! I hunted down that picture so you can see for yourself. She does look pretty airbrushed, no? </p>
<p>2. Ricky Gervais has lost weight recently, and now <a href="http://www.popeater.com/2010/10/04/ricky-gervais-weight-loss/">feels like jokes about fat people are off-limits</a>.  </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ve got to stop making jokes about fat people, which is annoying. When I was fat, it was okay,&#8221; the creator of &#8216;The Office&#8217; tells <em>People</em>. Gervais, 49, lost &#8220;20 or 22 pounds,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t so much about the weight. It was more that I was a fat, lazy, out of shape slob, to be honest.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ricky Gervais shutting up about fat people is probably <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2010/06/11/drop-dead-diva-fat-positive-television-and-ricky-gervais-again/">for the best</a>, then, isn&#8217;t it? Oh, <em>Ricky.</em></p>
<p>3. Kim Kardashian posed nude for <em>W Magazine</em> (<a href="http://tomandlorenzo2.blogspot.com/2010/10/kim-kardashian-for-w-magazine-nsfw.html">photos at this link are NSFW</a>) and the pictures are everywhere. There have been a lot of ugly comments that I&#8217;m sure you can find if you search for about ten seconds, but I liked this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m 5&#8217;1 and I love the way I look, and it&#8217;s nice to see more women with hourglass figures in the media lately, being unafraid to [bare] it all, like Christina Hendricks and Ms. Kardashian here. I&#8217;m not going to stop loving myself just because I have the figure of a cartoon character.</p>
<p>Stop the hate, people! There&#8217;s so much hate in the world, do we really have to tear each other down over how we perceive each others&#8217; bodies?</p></blockquote>
<p>4. Crystal Renn is a size 10, and <a href="http://manolobig.com/2010/10/18/retiring-crystal-renn/">Manolo for the Big Girl is over it</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s nothing wrong with being a size 10. She’s had a tough row to hoe body-image wise and if that’s where her body is happy then far be it from me to complain.</p>
<p>But she’s a size 10.</p>
<p>That’s not plus-sized, that’s not <em>close </em>to plus-sized and even though I am the biggest fashion industry apologist on the planet, I just can’t pretend that she counts as a plus-sized model in any meaningful sense and therefore she deserves no more and no less press or attention than any other model who doesn’t wear plus-size clothes.</p>
<p>I’m a big proponent for variety and I’d rather see a size 10 model as a staple than a size 20 as a gimmick every few years, but the days of breathlessly reporting on her every move as a victory for fat girl kind –inasmuch as I ever have– are over.</p></blockquote>
<p>5. Via <a href="http://the-f-word.org/blog/index.php/2010/09/18/celebs-come-out-of-the-ed-closet/">The F Word</a>, <a href="http://www.okmagazine.com/2010/09/thin-is-not-always-in-celebs-whove-struggled-with-eating-disorders">celebrities who have struggled with eating disorders</a> include Felicity Huffman, Elton John, Kate Winslet, Victoria Beckham, and Snooki. </p>
<blockquote><p>For years she denied the rumors that she had an eating disorder, but Calista Flockhart finally admitted to her problem with anorexia. &#8220;I started under-eating, over-exercising, pushing myself too hard and brutalizing my immune system. I guess I just didn&#8217;t find time to eat.&#8221; Even though the actress hasn&#8217;t gained much noticeable weight she ensures, &#8220;I am much more healthy these days.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I <a href="http://piebooks.blogspot.com/2010/10/four-books-cabot-rebello-krakauer.html">recently read</a> Kathy Griffin&#8217;s <em>Official Book Club Selection</em>, where she talked frankly about her binge eating, her husband&#8217;s binge eating, and going to Overeaters Anonymous&#8212;as well as the botched liposuction that nearly killed her. </p>

				<p>As you may or may not have noticed, it&#8217;s been a while! This is probably the longest unplanned hiatus since this blog began. But if you follow me <a href="http://twitter.com/bigfatdeal">on Twitter</a> or various other types of social media, you know that <a href="http://www.popeater.com/2010/10/06/burning-dan-gordon-levitt-dead/">a dear friend of mine</a> recently passed away. Between traveling for the funeral, grieving, illness, and schoolwork, I had to put BFD on the back burner for a bit. </p>
<p>Thanks to the snowball effect, I also haven&#8217;t been reading or answering my email as diligently as usual. If you&#8217;ve sent me something that requires a response, and it&#8217;s not too late for that response, it would be great if you would re-send it! It may take me a while to dig through my email and catch up, and I&#8217;d hate to miss anything urgent. </p>
<p>I also went through and screened something like 200 backlogged comments a couple of days ago. If you had a comment held in moderation, it should be up now. And if I deleted your comment by mistake, or approved something trolly or spammy, please let me know! I did speed through them pretty quickly. You can find the newest comments on the <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/comments/feed/">comments RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>I am also faced with the daunting task of catching up on everything I missed in the world of Fat News. I haven&#8217;t been reading the Fatosphere or anything like that, so if there is a Big Huge Topic that needs to be discussed, please assume I don&#8217;t know anything about it and shoot me a Tweet, an email, or a comment letting me know! </p>
<p>I was actually going to segue this into a real post, but this got longer than I thought it would. (That&#8217;s what she said.)  I missed you, my blog friends! Look for more posts soon. </p>

<p>Gaultier is, of course, the <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2007/06/10/oh-lamour/">same designer</a> who used Velvet D&#8217;Amour in a previous runway show. More pictures <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/03/beth-ditto-jean-paul-gaultier-spring-summer-2011_n_748335.html#s149256">at HuffPo</a>, where they pair the slideshow with this recent quote from Ditto:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really interesting to me that people will look at a thin person and go, &#8216;That&#8217;s a healthy person&#8217;. I want to go, &#8216;Come open my refrigerator and look and then let&#8217;s talk about what you think is so bad&#8217;. To be thin and to stay really thin, sometimes&#8230;some people literally do coke all the time. Some people smoke cigarettes instead of eating. That&#8217;s crazy. But that&#8217;s &#8216;okay&#8217; because you look healthier.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to Christina for the link! And thanks to Beth, and Jean Paul Gaultier, for being awesome.</p>

				<p>The other day, I got an email that touched me deeply. Mel was kind enough to allow me to repost it here. In our email conversation, we both agreed that a huge part of why BFD means so much to so many people is the community that has been created here. So this is a thank you from Mel to us, and a thank you from me to you: thank you so much for helping make this blog what it is.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Well.  I&#8217;m not entirely sure how to start this, so I suppose I&#8217;ll begin at (what&#8217;s more or less) the beginning.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, I was . . . down.  Not for any particular reason; nothing especially momentous or even noteworthy had happened, I hadn&#8217;t been the victim of any fat-based insults or disgusted/pitying/mocking looks.  When it comes right down to it, I just felt fat.  That&#8217;s all.  I felt fat and ugly and basically worthless.  While I&#8217;d love to say that this is something unusual, it&#8217;s really not.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been heavy my entire life.  Yes, heavy.  No, not fat.  Because looking back now, with a sense of perspective that you can really only achieve years after the fact, I wasn&#8217;t fat.  Actually, I was pretty damn cute.  I never felt that way, despite the fact that my family (and family friends) continually told me that I was.  I knew the truth, though&#8211;when I went to school I got teased for being fat, and I didn&#8217;t look like the other girls there or the girls and women on TV, and surely society as a whole wouldn&#8217;t be constantly telling me I was fat if it wasn&#8217;t actually true, right?  And the people who loved me, the very ones who told me that I was cute, wouldn&#8217;t all echo that sentiment if it wasn&#8217;t true.  Would they?  Of course not.  They loved me, they were concerned, and I was Fat.  I had no reason to doubt all those well-intentioned voices.</p>
<p>As it turns out (as I&#8217;m sure you know), living your entire life Fat doesn&#8217;t mean that it gets easier to deal with.  I keep capitalizing the word because that&#8217;s always how it sounded when I heard it.  I was Big, Overweight, Fat.  (I have the most insane urge right now to start calling myself a Person of Weight.  Apparently emotional vulnerability brings out my snark?  Not terribly surprising, I guess.)  The gist of all this being: most times I&#8217;m more or less fine, but sometimes twenty-seven years of insecurities and self-esteem issues all seem to hit me at once, and things are bad for a while.  It&#8217;s nothing new, but it sucks just as much every time.</p>
<p>So, yes.  I was having one of those days, and for reasons now lost to me in the whirl of whatever the hell was going on in my head at the time, I decided for the first time that I would look online to see if there was somewhere out there where people understood.  People who had lived with being Fat, and who knew all the millions of tiny ways that you were constantly reminded of it and the damage&#8211;mental, emotional, even physical&#8211;that it could cause.  Surely, I thought, there had to be something out there.  The internet is so huge!  So many tubes!  Some of them must be big enough for us.</p>
<p>My initial results were less than encouraging.  It seemed like every blog I found about Being Fat was, well, not.  They were about Not Being Fat, about struggles to lose weight and look good and let me tell you it wasn&#8217;t helping my mood any.  I&#8217;ve dieted and exercised and lost weight, but I can never seem to keep it off.  I always &#8220;backslide&#8221; at some point into poor eating habits and inactivity, always pack what I&#8217;ve shed right back on again.  So no, I&#8217;m sorry Random Internet Ladies, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re lovely but I didn&#8217;t want to read about your struggles against your own weight.  What I wanted was someone talking about still being Fat, and how they dealt with that.  I wanted someone to tell me that maybe, just maybe, it was still okay.  I was beginning to think I&#8217;d never find it, though, when suddenly I followed a link and found your blog and . . . oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p><strong>It was like a light being turned on.  Here were these women&#8211;clearly intelligent, definitely funny, quite attractive women&#8211;who were telling me things I&#8217;d always secretly hoped but never really believed.  That not only was it possible to be bigger than the &#8220;ideal&#8221; we&#8217;re fed and still be healthy, you can be healthy when you&#8217;re bigger than &#8220;average&#8221;, as well.  That I didn&#8217;t have to be ashamed just because of my weight.  That I was deserving and worthy and beautiful, and anyone who tried to tell me otherwise could fuck right off.  I read posts about self-confidence, about the media&#8217;s acceptance of &#8220;fatism&#8221;, about fashion, about women I had always thought were beautiful &#8220;even though&#8221; they weren&#8217;t as thin as society apparently thinks we all should be.  (Crystal Renn.  Seriously.  There are just no words.)  There were posts about being conflicted, torn between irritation/outrage at the continued exploitation of Fatness for the sake of a punchline, and wondering if that was just taking things too seriously.  There were some posts that I could&#8217;ve written, and some that I could&#8217;ve written if I were smarter and better informed.  Insight and humor and acceptance from people who didn&#8217;t think I was less worthy just because of how I look.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading back through the entries pretty much nonstop for the past two days (excepting tedious breaks for things like &#8220;work&#8221; and &#8220;sleep&#8221;).  I&#8217;m at the beginning of 2009 now, and I plan to keep going.  Because you took a girl who really believed that she was less because she was more, and made her think . . . maybe that&#8217;s not true.  Maybe I don&#8217;t have to wait to be thin to feel pretty.  Maybe I don&#8217;t have to look in the mirror before going out and think, &#8220;Good enough.&#8221;  Maybe I am already beautiful, already sexy.  And wouldn&#8217;t that be something?</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t pretend that everything is fixed now.  It will still be hard; I know it will.  I&#8217;ll still have moments, or hours, or days when other people&#8217;s disapproval will outweigh (pun not intended, but not really regretted, either) my own hard-won self-acceptance.  But tonight I put on some pretty clothes and some girly shoes and some sexy red lipstick; I went out with my friends, and looked at art, and had fun.  I ate and drank without stressing over what other people were thinking when they saw me.  I felt good, and confident, and yes, pretty.  Desirable.</p>
<p>Tonight I wasn&#8217;t Fat; I was fat.  And that was okay.</p>
<p>So . . . thanks.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,<br />
Mel</p></blockquote>

				<p>Over at The Rotund, Marianne recently posted a piece about <a href="http://www.therotund.com/?p=979">the normalizing power of shoe shopping.</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>Because they are never JUST shoes. They’re what I was, for a long time, allowed – when you’re fat and your options are limited, sometimes shoes become the thing you use to express yourself&#8230;</p>
<p>It’s one of the only areas in which I’ve ever had just as much choice as any other person on the street when it comes to things required for getting dressed. And that’s a powerful thing. It’s one reason I have what feels like so many shoes. It’s one reason I have so many DISTINCTIVE shoes – it matters less that my fashion options are limited if I can make a statement with my shoes.</p></blockquote>
<p>In her post, Marianne acknowledges that this is only possible for those who wear a readily available size shoe. And this reminded me I&#8217;ve been meaning to do a post for those of us who, like me, <i>don&#8217;t</i> wear a common shoe size. </p>
<p>I have always been tall and had large feet&#8212;I was wearing a size 9 shoe when I was 13. And of course, Persons of Size also sometimes have wider than average feet. All of this means we can&#8217;t walk into a shoe store and expect to find something that fits. Except Payless which, god bless em, goes up to a 12 and has wide widths, to boot. (HA! <em>TO BOOT!) </em> But, you know, Payless shoes do tend to fall apart sometimes.</p>
<p>So, what are our options? <a href="http://www.drag-queen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&#038;Store_Code=D&#038;Product_Code=PL-Seduce2020Patent&#038;Category_Code=Women%27s+Size">We can search Zappos by size or width</a>, paying close attention to the customer notes in the comments (some brands tend to run large or small) which allows us to hit shoes at a variety of price points. </p>
<p>As for specific designers, <a href="http://www.fluevog.com/code/?w[0]=size%3Awomen13&#038;pp=1">Fluevogs go up to size 13</a>, and they have some &#8220;unisex&#8221; styles as well. I know Weetabix has gotten Stuart Weitzmans and Guccis in <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/C/womens-shoes-view-all/boots?campaign=0927hpstory1&#038;origin=hp#category=b60128263|f8000792&#038;type=category&#038;page=1&#038;sort=featured&#038;sortreverse=0&#038;size=12&#038;width=&#038;color=&#038;price=&#038;brand=&#038;lastfilter=size">size 12 at Nordstrom</a> (which is currently having a &#8220;free shipping on shoes&#8221; sale). She&#8217;s the fancy Nordstrom shoe shopper, whereas I am the Payless shoe shopper. </p>
<p>And in <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2007/07/31/lets-go-to-the-malltoday/#comment-146410">this comment</a>, Lisa mentioned that drag queen shops usually have women&#8217;s shoes in generous sizes. (Well, they would.) So if you need a red leather stiletto boot in a size 15, <a href="http://www.drag-queen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&#038;Store_Code=D&#038;Product_Code=PL-Seduce2020Patent&#038;Category_Code=Women%27s+Size">this is your lucky day</a>.  </p>
<p>So, how about it? Ladies with Feet of Size, which brands work for you, and where do you buy them?</p>

		<div class="postdate">September 29th, 2010</div>

			<div class="entry">

				<p>With a special shout-out to Brianna, here are some links that popped up in Google Reader this week! </p>
<p>1. From Feed Me: <a href="http://harrietbrown.blogspot.com/2010/09/can-you-say-disconnect.html">Fat women are paid less than men in the workplace. So obviously, we should lose weight. Wait, what?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Fat women are paid less than women who aren&#8217;t fat; fat men, on average, earn comparable salaries to men who aren&#8217;t fat. So women are penalized by employers for being fat&#8230; All the young women who don&#8217;t identify as feminists because they don&#8217;t have to fly that flag anymore should take note of studies like this one. Gender discrimination is alive and well in 21st-century America.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not where the writer of this story went. No, her conclusion was quite different. She wrote, &#8220;It&#8217;s bad news, but maybe it will help fund better prevention strategies and new treatment methods for this growing scourge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Excuse me? Did I hear you right? The answer to discrimination is getting rid of the quality that&#8217;s being discriminated against?</p></blockquote>
<p>2. From Already Pretty: <a href="http://www.alreadypretty.com/2010/09/shouldnt-wear-that.html">the problem with &#8220;she shouldn&#8217;t wear that.&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote><p>[S]tylistic shoulds and shouldn&#8217;ts reinforce the idea that there are absolute rights and wrongs in clothing choices, tastes, and body shapes. Saying a woman “shouldn’t” wear something because of her figure supports the idea that there is one way to look good. And there isn’t. In fact, women who push social comfort levels with their stylistic choices may gradually force the observing public to accept that. Although some may prefer that women with cellulite conceal it, women with bony clavicles mask them, and women with zits apply cover-up, each woman is entitled to make her own choices.</p></blockquote>
<p>3. The theme of the comp class I&#8217;m teaching this semester is feminism (actually, I told them it was unofficially called &#8220;F the Patriarchy&#8221;&#8212;it&#8217;s led to some terrific debate and discussion) and I shared <a href="http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2010/09/well-gee-i-hope-hes-okay.html">this tidbit from Shakesville</a> with them the other day. A headline reads &#8220;<a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/103202934.html">Man badly burned when girlfriend&#8217;s house set on fire</a>&#8221; when, in actuality, he was her ex-boyfriend and stalker. And oh yeah, he set the fire.</p>
<blockquote><p>[A]n amazing example of how violence against women is minimized in news reporting&#8230; the violent stalker is badly burned. His intended victims, who merely were doused with gasoline and terrorized, are OK.</p></blockquote>
<p>4. From Womanist Musings: <a href="http://www.womanist-musings.com/2010/09/gabriel-sidibe-as-mammy.html">Gabourey Sidibe as &#8220;Mammy.&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote><p>There can be no denial that there are some people who will look at Gabourey and see mammy smiling back at them both consciously and unconsciously, yet that is not a function of her, but a function of Whiteness. When we use fat hatred to claim that her success is obscuring the talents of other Black women, we are only playing into the divisive strategy that Whiteness has long used to control people of colour. Even the Black women that some believe are deserving of greater accolades, are still perceived by Whiteness as fitting into either the jezebel or sapphire trope, and therefore; the way to divest ourselves of these horrible caricatures, is not to further demean another Black woman, but to defeat the idea that any of these labels are representative of Black womanhood. The entity that needs to disappear is mammy and not Gabourey. </p></blockquote>
<p>5. Terrific satirical essay from Lesley about <a href="http://www.fatshionista.com/cms/index.php?option=com_mojo&#038;Itemid=69&#038;p=554">the importance of the &#8220;suffering ween.&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The sight of fat women is a heavy cross said men must bear every moment they step out into the public spaces where people congregate, be they city streets or shopping malls or public transportation or the dentist’s office. Their eyes burning as though filled with a raging fire, their inability to control their speech — the inescapable, uncontrollable <em>need </em>to instruct the offending woman on the pain she is selfishly causing them — this is hardly their fault! They <em>must </em>say something, in the hope that their words will drive the fat woman back into the shadows and thereby cause the unthinkable torture being imposed upon their enfeebled weens to finally relent. They cannot be responsible for the things they say and do while in such agony. We cannot rightly blame them when it is men, and the relative rigidity of their supremely important peckers, who are being attacked here, attacked by fat women who dare to allow themselves to be seen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pretty awesome collection of links, am I right? Let&#8217;s discuss in the comments!</p>

				<p>Apparently I&#8217;m on a movie kick, but I couldn&#8217;t resist sharing this great article in Newsweek exploring <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/22/why-family-films-are-so-sexist.html">the subtle sexism in recent kid movies</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;One in four female characters was depicted in “sexy, tight, or alluring  attire,” compared with one in 25 male characters. The female characters  were also more likely than men to be beautiful, and one in five were  “portrayed with some exposed skin between the mid-chest and upper thigh  regions.” Because you wouldn’t want to take on the world without baring  your midriff—girl power! (Another study found, troublingly, that women  in G-rated films wear the same amount of skimpy clothing as women in  R-rated films.) One in four women was shown with a waist so small that,  the authors concluded, it left “little room for a womb or any other  internal organs.” Maybe we could carry them in our purses?</p></blockquote>
<p>No wonder <a href="../2009/02/04/old-timey-clothing-ad-for-chubby-kids/">young girls</a> are reporting body image issues <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2009/11/26/5-things-you-may-have-missed/">earlier and earlier</a>.  Not only are fat  females treated by the filmmakers as lesser or non-sexual grandmothers,  but the girls we&#8217;re supposed to emulate are hyper-sexualized with giant  Hentai eyes and Angelina Jolie pouts. And to think we all blamed <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2008/05/13/i-believe-the-bratz-dolls-are-our-future/">Bratz dolls</a>!</p>
<p>You know, I honestly cannot think of a sympathetic fat female human character in an animated kid&#8217;s movie.  There were fat people in <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2008/02/12/funny-or-offensive/">Wall-E</a>, of course, but it was pretty offensive stereotyping.  I think Mrs. Potts eventually turns into a fat human, but for the majority of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, she&#8217;s tableware.  Arguably, one of Sleeping Beauty&#8217;s fairy friends is a plus-sized fairy, but that movie is old than my grandmother. Likewise, <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2008/03/04/hyacinth-hippo/">Hyacinth the Hippo</a>. Dora the Explorer isn&#8217;t a svelte lass, but she&#8217;s also like <em>six</em>. And there are never <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2009/06/18/i-dont-care-for-your-fairytales/">fat princesses</a>.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s Ursula the Sea Witch. <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2007/10/08/poor-unfortunate-souls/">Love her. </a></p>
<blockquote><p>You  know, she’s the first fat villian who really has some power. The  other  fat girls in Disney movies are either fairy godmothers (who  twitter a  lot) or singing teapots. Up until Ursula, the female villians  were all  tall, angular women with pinched faces (Cruella DeVille; the  Wicked  StepMother in Snow White; the aunt with the Siamese cats in Lady  and  the Tramp;  Maleficient, who is also awesome for rocking that head   gear) and she ends up embodying ultimate power (and, you know, getting   stabbed by a boat, but whatevs).</p></blockquote>
<p>But the fact remains that Ursula is still evil, and definitely not sympathetic. In fact, the only plus-sized female main character in recent memory is Princess Fiona, who is introduced to us first as being thin and Cameron Diaz-y and then her plus-size state is explained by her having been cursed. Seriously. Cursed! And the only reason she ends up being ok with her state is the fact that her man loves her best when she&#8217;s all green and belchy.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s discuss in the comments!</p>

				<p>We&#8217;ve talked about how much we love Mindy Kaling here <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2008/09/29/thats-what-she-said/">before</a>. In this <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/09/watch_youve_got_mail_with_mind.html?mid=twitter_vulture">great interview</a>, she talks about the problem with writing realistic women characters and the rom-com she&#8217;s writing and how much she loves <em>You&#8217;ve Got Mail</em> (me TOO! OMG Mindy Kaling, let&#8217;s be bffs!) She touches upon this interesting trope of the fictionalized woman, something that bugs me too:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>How did you feel about <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>? Did it bug you that the main character walked away from a good job at the end, to go back to her boyfriend — like that was the only way she could be happy?</strong><br />
I felt like they tried to buy it back by saying what she <em>really</em> wanted was to write political pieces at her temp job. That was a hokey part of the story. At least she wasn’t a klutz. So many comedies and TV shows make pretty, skinny women klutzes — they have no discernible flaws, so let’s make them a klutz!</p>
<p><strong>Like Liz Lemon.</strong><br />
Debra Messing was always doing that on <em>Will &amp; Grace</em>. <em>(Ed note&#8211;Also, basically any character played by Michelle Pfeiffer, J.Lo and more recently, Kristen Bell)</em></p>
<p><strong>It’s such an old trope. </strong><br />
The other one is actresses who clearly starve themselves playing characters who get picked on by the guy for eating too much.</p>
<p><strong>In <em>Valentine’s Day</em>, the Jessica Biel character does that. When she gets nervous she shoves food into her mouth. Of course, it’s okay for Biel to do that because she’s in the best shape of any woman alive, so shoving food in her mouth isn’t offensive. </strong><br />
It would be so funny if an actual fat woman shoved food in her mouth. People would be horrified! They’d want to kill her! Is that an Onion headline? <em>Actual Fat Woman Shoves Food in her Mouth in Romantic Comedy</em>!</p></blockquote>
<p>She&#8217;s right! When did you last see a fat woman eating in a movie when it wasn&#8217;t a fat joke? Even in <a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/2007/09/27/dear-farrelly-brothers-you-can-derilique-my-balls/"><em>Shallow Hal</em></a> (which I watched recently&#8230; so close and yet, so fucking far) when they show the fat character eating, it&#8217;s Gwyneth Paltrow not Gwyneth-In-A-Fat-Suit-Paltrow. How are we ever supposed to get over the idea of body shame when the very idea of us nourishing our bodies is clearly revolting to the rest of the world?</p>
<p>This is too depressing, so instead, I&#8217;ll just <strong></strong> leave the rest to you guys in the comments.</p>
<p>PS. Marry me, Mindy Kaling?</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.bfdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/gabbycover1.jpg"><img src="http://www.bfdblog.com/wp-content/uploads/gabbycover1-e1284843653655.jpg" alt="" title="gabbycover" width="147" height="200" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3346" /></a>1.  Gabby Sidibe was on one of four covers of <em>Elle Magazine</em> featuring young Hollywood stars. But she was the only one whose body was cropped out. Oh, <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2010/09/16/elle-magazine-tries-to-show-us-gabourey-sidibes-lighter-side/?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Racialicious+%28Racialicious+-+the+intersection+of+race+and+pop+culture%29">and her skin was lightened, too</a>.</p>
<p>2. Levi&#8217;s has come out with <a href="http://fatchic.net/2010/09/09/levi-steps-in-on-the-jeans-fit-dilemma/">new &#8220;Curve ID&#8221; jeans</a>, with different cuts similar to the Lane Bryant Right Fit concept. They go up to a size 24.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://disabledfeminists.com/2010/09/11/conversations-about-body-image-a-place-at-the-table-for-me/">Making space for all kinds of bodies when we talk about body image</a>, from Disabled Feminists. The post also addresses the idea of making space for those who don&#8217;t love their bodies at all. A thought-provoking read.</p>
<p>4.  <a href="http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-obese-teen-house-fire,0,6041158.story">500-pound teen dies in a fire</a> when fire crews are unable to lift her. Heather, who sent in the article, pointed out how hateful the comments are in response to this tragedy, with references to her &#8220;eating herself to death.&#8221; Ugh.</p>
<p>5. Shapely Prose <a href="http://kateharding.net/2010/09/15/welcome-to-the-shapely-prose-archive/">officially shuts its doors</a>, and Kate Harding <a href="http://kateharding.info/2010/09/15/in-which-i-finally-explain-where-ive-been-and-finally-decide-where-ill-be/">talks about her plans for the future</a>. The end of an era!</p>
<p>Want to talk about any of this stuff? I know I do! Let&#8217;s take it to the comments!</p>
