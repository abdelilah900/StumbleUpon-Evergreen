<p>A few weeks ago, a reader left a comment that made me think about the things we wear every day and why we wear them. She was asking for advice on what to do when people ask &#8220;why are YOU so dressed up?&#8221; As if wearing something cute that makes you feel good is a &#8220;strange&#8221; thing to do!</p>
<p>That comment got me thinking about dressing up and what that means.</p>
<p>Since when did it become an unusual thing to put effort into what you wear and have fun with fashion? Since when is anyone not wearing sweatpants and a hoodie breaking unwritten social rules? <b>Why should &#8220;dressing up&#8221; be reserved for special occasions only?</b></p>
<p>I was immediately inspired to create this list. I firmly believe in &#8220;dressing up&#8221; every day of your life, and I think you should too!</p>
<h3>So why dress up? Here are 25 good reasons.</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because life&#8217;s too short to blend in. Don&#8217;t settle for average.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because you&#8217;re only young once. You&#8217;re way more gorgeous than you know &amp; have a fabulous body you&#8217;ll one day look back on and wish you had! Take advantage now and show off how fabulous you can be.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because fashion is a method of self expression. What are you trying to say?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because you never know who you&#8217;ll run into. Brad Pitt at the grocery store? Hey, stranger things have happened.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because it obviously annoys some people (like the guy who asks why YOU are so dressed up). The fact that it annoys them so much is all the more reason to keep doing it.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because you never know, there&#8217;s always a chance you could get snapped by <a href="http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Sartorialist</a> (or maybe the girls over at <a href="http://www.street-spotted.com/" target="_blank">Street Spotted</a>)!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because you deserve to look your best at all times.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because you&#8217;ll never improve your sense of style if your default look is &#8220;I give up&#8221;. Yes, that was a Seinfeld reference. But it&#8217;s true!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because dressing up helps you weed out friends who don&#8217;t love you for you. If they have a problem with the way you dress, they&#8217;re not the kind of friends you want around.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because cute clothes and accessories are a great conversation starter. Wear something fabulous and people will ask you where you got it.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because parties aren&#8217;t the only time to celebrate.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because that fabulous party dress in your closet cost too much to only be worn once. Remember <a href="http://www.collegefashion.net/shopping/how-to-splurge/">cost per wear</a>?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because it&#8217;s fun!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because even if you live in an &#8220;unstylish&#8221; city &amp; are scared to dress up, cities don&#8217;t become stylish without someone going first. I know it sounds cheesy, but be the change you want to see in the world. Everyone else can follow your fabulous lead.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because dressing up helps you make fashion mistakes and get past them. Mistakes happen to everyone and that&#8217;s how you learn what not to do &#8211; get them out of the way now!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because it&#8217;s a test of your confidence. Dressing unconventionally forces you to develop the self-assurance necessary to stand out from everyone else.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because fashion is one of the rare instances where art comes alive. What artistic statement do you want to make?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because if you&#8217;ve got it (great style, killer confidence, amazing legs), it&#8217;s just wrong not to flaunt it.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because someday when you have a 9-5 corporate job and are required to wear business suits, you&#8217;re going to miss the freedom of dress you had in college. Experiment now! There&#8217;s no better time.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because glamour isn&#8217;t only reserved for the rich and famous, even though maybe they&#8217;d like you to believe it is.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because if conspiracy theorists are to be believed, the world might end on 12/31/2012 &#8211; that&#8217;s only 1211 days from now! Even though we all worried about Y2K too, why not be on the safe side? Don&#8217;t spend the theoretical 1211 days you have left in sweats.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because Carrie Bradshaw would not approve of your sweatpants and UGG boots. You can do better than that. And deep down, you know I&#8217;m right.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because dressing well means you don&#8217;t have to do your hair at all &#8211; you&#8217;ll have that ultra fabulous, slightly disheveled Kate Moss look.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because nothing beats the rush you feel when you look in the mirror and LOVE what you see.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.collegefashion.net/wp-content/themes/cftheme/images/pink-star.png" alt="*" /> Because you want to. That&#8217;s the only reason that matters.</p>

<p>Wow I know exactly what you mean. I dress up a lot more then most teens in my city (i love my high waisted skirts, blazers, etc) and I always get asked if I&#8217;m going somewhere special or what the occasion is. I wish people would take more fashion risks and not worry about what others think :)</p>

<p>FANTASTIC post! I know that both me and my roommate (slash one of my best friends) LOVE to dress up for no reason at all and this just gives me even more motivation to get my style-on!</p>

<p class="byline"><strong>awkward grinnellian</strong></p>
<p>If I could just offer another perspective&#8211; at my college, pretty much everyone wears jeans and a college hoodie and sneakers pretty much every day.  The two advantages to this, as I see it, are that it gets rid of the class distinction between those who can afford designer labels and those who have to make do with only two pairs of pants (almost everyone here is on scholarship and a lot of us have to work our way through college and/or have major loans), and it also makes us look to our classmates for their brilliant minds and not for what they&#8217;re wearing.  Would you really rather be known for your legs than for your ideas?  Aren&#8217;t we going to college to develop our minds, not our wardrobes?  There are so many people in the world who don&#8217;t even have enough food to eat or clean water to drink that it seems wasteful to spend so much money on clothes just to follow the whims of fashion.  Maybe we should focus less on what people wear and more on the people inside the clothes.</p>
<p>(Yes, I realize this is a fashion blog and I don&#8217;t mean to insult anyone.  I&#8217;m simply an awkward academic trying to understand the appeal of fashion.)</p>

<p>I love this! i love to dress up and for those of you who watch Gossip Girl, Blair Waldorf also loves to dress up (she&#8217;s my fave character). By the way Zephyr, when are you going to write the article on accessories? I really need a great bag for back to school and i&#8217;m having trouble! Thanks :)</p>

<p>@awkward grinnellian:</p>
<p>You can develop your mind and sense of style at the same time. In fact, you could argue that using your wardrobe as an outlet for creativity is in a way developing your mind. You also don&#8217;t need to spend a lot of money on clothes &#8211; sure, many do, but having loads of money certainly isn&#8217;t a prerequisite to dress in a way that makes you happy (which isn&#8217;t necessarily what is on the &#8220;whims of fashion&#8221;). I see where you&#8217;re coming from, but I don&#8217;t think that dressing in a way that is exciting to you and being an academic have to be mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m an awkward academic. An English major. And broke. I own no designer label items. I don&#8217;t spend a ton of money on clothes. I just put them together in unique ways. And the money I save not succumbing to fads I donate to charities that provide clean water for children in third world countries. And I look great while doing it. I have the best of both worlds. Everyone can.</p>

<p>This is a brilliant post!!</p>
<p>I get asked that too, because I am only 14 and live in a small town in Canada. Everyone wears skinny jeans/sweatpants, uggs/sneakers, and a hoodie. Therefore, I really stand out and people always say they want to make me over so I look &#8220;In.&#8221; I hate that! Next time someone says that to me, I am going to come right back with one of these remarks. HA</p>
<p>I love high waisted skirts, wrap dresses, wide leg trousers, high heeled boots, waistcoats, rich purples, blues, greens, and red, classy book bags, and red lipstick. This is who I am and I am NOT changing it!</p>

<p>Thank you so much, Zephyr!<br />
I was handling this problem all this week. My response was, &#8220;Because I can wear anything that pleases me.&#8221;<br />
Dressing up makes me feel fabulous, and powerful. I like feeling that way.<br />
And (not knocking it) I&#8217;m tired of all the girls with pin straight hair, neon skinny jeans, and band tees from hot topic. I love all of those things, but not together EVERY DAY. I like to be different and stand out.<br />
So THREE CHEERS for fashion and being different!</p>

<p>I recently started dressing up, wearing skirts and boots [gifts I had received last xmas and finally started wearing], flowy tops from salvation army and ballet flats over skater shoes. People keep asking me if I&#8217;m going to party/bar/fancy restaurant or why I dress up, I just smile and say I do it for me. To which they usually stare at me like I sprouted a second head, and I move on. I&#8217;ve had a lot more confidence, standing straighter, and being more outgoing since changing from sweats/yoga pants/hoodies/sneakers to dresses/leggings/skinny jeans and prettier tops. I didn&#8217;t think clothes would affect my attitude so much, I even find it easier to do presentations.</p>

<p>I second the opinions of both Britteny and Julie. I scour vintage shops, charity shops, and the sale racks in my favourite stores. I am also part of a group that donated 24 goats to help widows in Rwanda. Yes, throwing away tons of money on designer clothing in the latest fads is really wasteful. So is having a wardrobe full of clothes that you don&#8217;t wear. But I think what Zephyr is talking about is looking GOOD and being proud of the fact that you take pride in your appearence, not having tons of designer clothing and a wardrobe bursting at the seams.</p>
<p>Hope this helped to explain!</p>

<p>awkward grinnellian,</p>
<p>I can totally see your point. As a pre-med student with blonde hair, I&#8217;m constantly fighting to be taken seriously because of the way I look. But at the same time, I am also on a scholarship and I can&#8217;t afford designer stuff. Instead I shop at Ross, TJ Maxx, Target, thrift stores and scour sale racks for good deals. Plus a college hoodie is around $30-40. I can get three shirts for that same amount. It really depends on your personality and the way you look at it. I consider myself pretty fashion forward, but I&#8217;m also a geek at heart. It&#8217;s really not about what others think. It&#8217;s all about what you choose to wear and how you present yourself to others. If you project confidence because you feel good about yourself, then others will show confidence in you too. But if you don&#8217;t take care of yourself, it&#8217;s going to be harder for others to take you seriously. Looking put together gives you the confidence to express your thoughts and work towards bettering the world for the good of everyone. But that&#8217;s just my opinion. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m one of those people who would rather spend the money on feeding hungry children than buying a louis v. bag, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t also be interested in fashion, too.</p>

<p>Zephyr, I totally agree with you that dressing up is so much fun! It can brighten up my day when I feel I look exceptionally good that day.</p>
<p>But the annoying thing is that people around me usually look very sloppy. So it makes me feel rather odd that I am all dressed up. I tried to ignore them most of the time because what&#8217;s important is I am feeling good about myself. And yes, I do get comments like &#8211; why are you so dressed up / glamorous today? It is kinda out of place!</p>
<p>I have to admit it does make me feel a little demoralizing.</p>

<p>Great post! I am going back to school in a few days and I have vowed to myself to make an effort to dress up everyday and not just for going out. I used to dress up in high school everyday and I loved it. I don&#8217;t know what happened when I went to college but I am changing my ways for my second year. What would Carrie Bradshaw do? That is my new motto haha. Do you have any suggestions for a stylish alternative to a Northface or fabulous yet practical winter/snow boots that aren&#8217;t UGGs? Love your blog :)</p>

<p>I LOVE this post! I have been thinking about this topic for a while now. I have so many clothes/accessories that I don&#8217;t use because I&#8217;m &#8220;saving&#8221; them, for what I don&#8217;t know. I just have convinced myself that some days deserve cool outfits while others don&#8217;t and I have a lot of days when I dress &#8220;blah&#8221;. I feel if I wear an awesome outfit on a day that might be lame (which is ridic because like you indicated ya never know what will happen) then the outfit would have been wasted. Well that is silly and I&#8217;m going to change and take advantage of everything I own and how creative/colorful/expressive I am/can be. This post gave me the push to finally make up my mind and live life to my trendiest (which aids living life to the fullest). I always feel way better when I&#8217;m dressed cute anyway. Thank you! = )<br />

<p>what do you mean by dressed up?<br />
sure i understand not ugg boots and sweatpantgs, but does jeans and a cute t-shirt qualify.<br />
i know its not like dressing up,but sometimes i&#8217;m the most confident in that laid back yet stylish vibe.<br />
i feel like dressing up can mean so many different things to different people, and maybe some girl took 30 mins to find the perfect leggings, ugg boot and sweatshirt combo.</p>

<p>Zephyr, you just made my day! I&#8217;ve been thinking about this topic today and really wanted some inspirational answers. How do you do it?! I love this article.<br />
In fact, these type of articles are my favorite from you. It&#8217;s the reason why I go to this site. </p>
<p>I do stand out from what most people wear at college here. I just can&#8217;t wear jeans everyday. Especially not in the summer and fall when there are these gorgeous fall skirts and attire. I don&#8217;t like to be boring so I always change things up. It gives me loads of confidence and makes me happy! =D</p>
<p>My favorite reason is the one about how everyday is a celebration. that fits my philosophy and I&#8217;m going to mention it whenever someone comments on my dress.</p>
<p>Can you do an article on age-appropriate dressing? I know that one can pull off anything with fit and confidence, but I&#8217;m still curious to read your views on the subject. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been thinking about&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks! &lt;3</p>

<p>Zephyr, this has to be my favorite article ever! </p>
<p>I absolutely hate when people ask why you dressed up (esp. for class or whatever) and my confidence always takes a stab when they ask such a question but you answered it so so well! </p>
<p>I really am going to take what you wrote to heart because it is so true and we should never feel ashamed for &#8220;dressing up&#8221; or taking time to look great! </p>
<p>Thank you so much! :)</p>

<p>Great post! I absolutely agree 100% with everything you said. I always make the effort to dress up no matter where it is I&#8217;m going. I do sometimes get asked why I&#8217;m all dressed up with nowhere to go though. I also love playing with make-up and wearing bright colored eyeshadow and nail polish. I often get looked at for not wearing the same natural eyeshadow colors and red or pink nails that all the other girls are sporting. But the way I see it is, if people are actually looking at me and talking about my style (even if there comments aren&#8217;t necessarily positive) then I must be doing something right for them to notice me over everyone else. I like to be different and stand out from the crowd. I&#8217;m also an artist and love express my creativity in any way that I can.</p>
<p>Another reason I put so much effort into my look is because one career option I&#8217;m considering is becoming a stylist. If I&#8217;m going to be trusted to style other people, I need to start with myself. And who&#8217;s going to hire a stylist that wears nothing but sweats and sneakers everyday?</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m a fashion student and I feel I need to look the part (and yes, even many girls in my fashion classes sport the typical &#8220;sweats and sneakers uniform&#8221; of a college student). Even when I&#8217;m not in school, if I meet someone new and tell them about my major, I want them to see that I truly am passionate about it. The person I&#8217;m talking to could end up being a future employer or client of mine. Hey, you never know. As you said, stranger things have happened.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to insult anyone who does wear sweats and sneakers often though. Just wanted to state why I prefer not to.</p>

<p>&#8230;because it&#8217;s a creative challenge: how good can you look by wearing affordable pieces? </p>
<p>This is one of my reasons (the one that you didn&#8217;t mention). I was never interested in fashion prior to college, but now it&#8217;s what I do on my breaks (e.g. peruse affordable shopping sites, peruse blogs such as this one, etc.). I&#8217;m a girl who loves a deal and as goofy as it sounds, coming up with creative outfits that are budget-friendly is a source of inspiration to me.</p>

<p>Zephyr, somewhere long ago we must be related. I agree with this post wholeheartedly, and I get the &#8220;dressed up&#8221; question a lot, especially about my (extensive) high-heeled-shoe collection that I parade all over campus in, no matter the season, and only occasionally stymied by the weather. I used to be a supporter of an &#8220;off day&#8221; every now and then, but, while I would never criticize another person for taking a day off from style, I have tried my best to give it up and always look as put-together as I can. Even a simple swipe of foundation and mascara, a cute pair of flats, and a cardi look better than no makeup, flip-flops, and a swetashirt. Z, rock on!!</p>

<p>Well I dress up every once in a while simply because when I was younger I was not a t-shirt kind of girl (I&#8217;m talking middle school and high school) &#8211; I just thought they were too casual and it kind of always stuck with me. I own tons of t-shirts now, especially a bunch that I got over the years in college, but I still manage to look nice even when I wear them (go accessories!) Plus I know I&#8217;m more on the plus-size so it&#8217;s nice to get complimented a lot of the time on still looking nice.</p>
<p>And I remember reading your cost-per-wear thing when you wrote it (that was over a year ago, wasn&#8217;t it?) and it *still* comes to mind every single time I think about buying clothes (or anything for that matter). Thanks!</p>

<p>The timing of this post could not have been more perfect! I dress up because it gives me confidence, because I KNOW I have style&#8230;and so I can show the world (ok, my peers) that even a nerdy science student (we have a bad rep) can look and feel fabulous at all times.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t get why people think you need designers or a ton of clothes to be fashionable&#8230; fashion is expression and expression requires creativity. Also, you can get creative if you can&#8217;t afford many clothes. Buy things you can wear in a lot of different ways, go to vintage/flee markets (I&#8217;ve found so many pieces I love at my local vintage stores). </p>
<p>Also, whenever I clean out my closet to add my new pieces, I donate almost all my clothes (some dresses I do sell to consignments) to those who need them. </p>
<p>Also consider the fact when you look for jobs and go to interviews, your potential employer judges you the moment you walk in based on what you are wearing. They are gonna be more impressed with someone who took the time to dress up over someone who wears jeans and a hoodie.</p>

<p>This is such a great, refreshing post! Makes you really ponder how non-shallow fashion can be. I agree with Julie in that everyone&#8217;s definition of &#8220;dressing up&#8221; is a little different, but as long as it makes you feel good, and helps you express your inner creativity, you&#8217;ll always look good! :)</p>

<p>Thank you, Zephyr!  This article is probably my favorite out of all the ones that you&#8217;ve written so far.  You give us gals the inspiration to keep dressing the way we want to regardless of insensitive comments from others.  =D</p>

<p>I love getting dressed up because it gives me confidence. I&#8217;ve had people come up to me saying &#8220;Oh! I love that dress!&#8221; And you&#8217;ll look back and be amazed how great of a body you had.</p>
<p>I think there should be a post about what kind of accesories are in.</p>

<p>dressing up is reserved for a time when the way i look holds some kind of importance&#8230;i.e. like a job interview, or when i need to make a good impression, but most of the time i have other things of importance on my mind. </p>
<p>appearance isn&#8217;t everything.</p>

<p>i totally agree.  its so annoying when people ask why i always dress up!  thats why every time i see someone wearing something out of the ordinary or &#8220;dressed up&#8221;, i go out of my way to compliment them, and tell them specific things that i like about his or her outfit&#8230;because they probably get more questions than compliments</p>

<p>Because fashion is a method of self expression.!!!!<br />
My style is fitness chic that indicates the sublimation of a a person&#8217;s attitude towards sports coupled with the care for fashion detail in different contexts from relaxed to glamour. My mind is fitness  and my heart is fitness chic.</p>

<p>i don&#8217;t get why people think that just because you dress up and care about how you look means you&#8217;re shallow. reserving dressing up for only job interviews and presentations doesn&#8217;t give you the practice of building a style. also the point of you never know who you&#8217;re going to meet, you never know when you will meet someone you want to impress. job offers can come from anywhere, and who wants to hire someone in yoga/sweats. dressing up is not only for bubble brains, it   makes you memorable and gives you confidence, and it can be the straw that makes people choose you over someone else.</p>
<p>this post is awesome, and the point about living in a small town super applies to me, but i made a promise to myself that no matter what i will stick to my heart and show off my killer style :).</p>

<p>i have this quote saved on my computer and it def fits here:</p>
<p>There is a story I recall that brings some of this home — It is about the death of a mate, where the husband shares with his brother-in-law, a tissue wrapped package.  “This, he said, is not a slip.  It is lingerie.”  He discarded the tissue and handed the slip to his brother-in-law.  It was exquisite; silk, hand made, trimmed in lace.  The price tag with an astronomical figure on it, was still attached.  The husband then tells how his wife had bought the slip on a trip 8 or 9 years before, and she never wore it.  She was saving it for a “special occasion”.   Then he said, “I guess this is the occasion.”  He took the slip and placed it on the bed with the other clothes they were taking to the mortician.  After a pause, the husband turned and said, “Don’t ever save anything for a special occasion.  Every day you are alive is a special occasion.”</p>

<p>I absolutely loveeee this post! I get dressed up everyday for class, and have always been asked since high school why I get dressed up. Personally, I dont feel ready for the day if I&#8217;m not dressed (i.e not sweats) so why not look fabulous when I do? I&#8217;m a huge shopper, and I hate saving things for a &#8220;special occasion&#8221;.<br />
The other reason I get dressed up is for the boost of confidence I get from all the compliments. People frequently come up to me and tell me how nice it is to see someone nicely dressed on a college campus instead of just wearing a t-shirt and jeans, and those type of compliments make my day. Just yesterday, someone I barely know came up to me in the dining hall and told me how awesome and pulled together I looked. The compliment was so genuine and heartfelt rather than the usual &#8220;you look cute!&#8221;, that it completely made my day.</p>

<p>Wow! What a great post, definetely inspired. In fact, i have just gone and put on the dress i have worn once to a party a while back. It&#8217;s gorgeous, and I always said, &#8216;Oh, i&#8217;ll save it for a special occasion, it&#8217;s too expensive and dressy to wear in the day.&#8217; But i&#8217;m wearing it now, and to christen it, i&#8217;m going to go out into town now and wait to see Brad Pitt, and laugh at all the girls in there sweats and hoodies, while he invites me to his next movie premiere. :)</p>
<p>Thank you Zephyr!</p>

<p>Aw, reading all your comments is making me so happy! I&#8217;m so glad you guys like the post, and it&#8217;s rad to hear that you guys enjoy dressing up on a daily basis too.</p>
<p>One thing I wanna clarify is that dressing up doesn&#8217;t mean any one thing &#8211; it could be different for everyone. Really it&#8217;s just about putting some effort in and wearing something you LOVE and that makes you feel fabulous! Whether that&#8217;s just a cute shirt and some skinny jeans or a pretty dress or something totally out there and unique, that&#8217;s what dressing up is in the context of this article. Doesn&#8217;t have to mean designer clothes or spending lots of money at all!!</p>

<p>Wow great post, i&#8217;m so glad I stumbled upon it, as I was just thinking about this. I love trying out new outfits and combos :) especially when I find things in charity shops and vintage shops no one else will have ^__^!<br />
It just makes me feel better when I know i&#8217;ve made an effort, not necessarily because I care what other people might think. Dressing up everyday is very fun, I wore my new favorite outfit to go to the bank and starbucks this morning and it was awesome XD</p>
<p>I do love hanging around the house in my pj bottoms and old baggy jumper though!</p>

<p>I love this list!! So much of it is very true. I try my best to be as true to myself every day, and part of the way I do that is through how I dress. I feel life is too short, and I want to be able to look back when I&#8217;m older and feel I really did everything I wanted to do, especially through my apperance, while I was young and able to!</p>
<p>Good job for writing such an inspiring article! :)</p>

<p>I love this article! It makes me want to show it to my friends! Just yesterday I was hanging out with 2 of them and they commented on how I was so dressed up when we went out to dinner and then over to one of their houses. Of course they were both wearing t-shirts and jeans but I wear scrubs and t-shirts to work so when I get the chance to wear something nicer, I grab the opportunity! Plus, it always makes you feel so much better about yourself when you wear something you love! Thanks for this article!!</p>

<p>This post is incredible. I remember one day last semester i wore a pair of slouchy boots to school. i swear the heel was an inch and a half at most, but of course my friend (who wears sweats to school daily) said to me &#8220;how come youre so dressed up today?&#8221; i kind of just blew off her question because i knew i looked great that day and i was feeling totally confident.<br />
literally months later, i was hanging out with some girls, including sweatpants girl, and she made a comment about how stylish she thought i was and even told everyone about my great pair of boots that she adored. she also said she wished she had the confidence to wear those kinds of things to school. WOO!</p>
<p>so the moral is, i dress up because i feel better about myself, and because i know haters are usually just non-haters who are a little rude sometimes :)</p>
<p>ps as someone mentioned: one college hoodie=about 8 cute t&#8217;s from forever 21</p>

<p>I dress up every day because I feel more professional when I do. If I feel put together in the way I look, chances are I&#8217;ll feel put together in my classes &amp; feel like I&#8217;m being taken more seriously when I meet with professors.</p>

<p>Awkward grinnellian posed the question &#8220;Would you really rather be known for your legs than for your ideas?&#8221; but who says you can&#8217;t be known for both? I have a ton of respect for well rounded people, who balance their academics, arts, and social activities, and when they dress well on top of that, it shows that they&#8217;re really in control of their life. I have a friend who is an athlete, deans list student, president of her sorority, and a public service scholar, and she&#8217;s always well dressed. We all wonder how she does it. I think the way she dresses has a lot to do with our respect for her, as a uniform of sweats would give off the impression that she&#8217;s frazzled and that her activities have left her with little sleep or energy.</p>

<p>What are your tips to look dressy? I&#8217;m mostly a girl who wears a pair of jeans and t-shirt. How can I break the mold to start looking better or look good in just that?</p>

<p>This post is absolutely fabulous! I adore dressing up, I love wearing high waisted skirts, ruffles tops, blazers, dresses, studs, fabulous boots, cute coats e.t.c. Even on my worst days I vow not to wear sweats to school. I&#8217;ve had some extremely rude comments and things like &#8220;Where&#8217;s SHE going all dressed up like THAT?!&#8221; &#8220;Oh, got a funeral or a wedding after this?&#8221; in snipy voices. But when I wear those clothes I KNOW I look good, and when I see people giving me looks as if they want my clothes it feels good. I wish all my friends would read this post! People came up to me an complimented me on what I was wearing, it just feels good. I remember I wore these fabulous pair of brown leather boots to class one day and all day I got compliments the entire day. :P During the morning announcements my teacher kept flicking her eyes to me and when it was over she looked at me and said I looked really good :P Where everyone thinks t-shirts, hoodies and sweats are what makes you &#8216;cool&#8217; it&#8217;s awesome to be different, and this post really  gave me a boost of confidence!</p>
<p>Luinae &#8211; I understand exactly how you feel!</p>

<p>I love dressing up for anything and everything, because it makes me feel pretty and confident.</p>

<p>Absolutely fabulous post!</p>
<p>I live in an area full of your standard country people. Pretty much everywhere I go I can find someone in pajamas or sweatpants. Rarely do I see people dressed nicely and wearing heels in the grocery store.</p>
<p>Fashion is a great way to express yourself. So many people seem to hold back because they&#8217;re afraid of what others might think. It&#8217;s quite unfortunate. Everyone needs to let go and stop worrying. Just wear what you like, no matter what anyone thinks.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s extremely important to put thought into the way you dress. You never know who you are going to meet. You could meet a potential employer and that person might decide not to hire you because you&#8217;re out and about wearing sweatpants, looking like a hot mess. It&#8217;s always better to look presentable.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for posting this!! My friend and i love to talk about fashion and her style is very classic cool and casual (lots of plaid!) and mine is much more girly (lots of skirts!) so when i shop with her i&#8217;ll pick up a skirt and she&#8217;ll say something like, &#8220;that&#8217;s cute, but i&#8217;d never  wear it cuz its too dressy for school&#8221; It makes me angry because usually i really want it. It doesnt bother me enough that i don&#8217;t try it on but its still annoying :(</p>

<p>This is something I always struggle with; I like pretty clothes, but I feel guilty for spending so much time or effort with how I look. I feel that fashion is shallow and superficial or at least not as beneficial as many other activities (one reason why I decided early on not to be a fashion designer). Even your listed reasons did not really help the matter (sorry). </p>
<p>The only non-self-absorbed and practical reasons I can think of are:</p>
<p>1. Making a good impression on university staff and potential employers (and who knows when you&#8217;ll bump into them). </p>
<p>2. Fairly representing yourself to others. Others make assumptions from how you dress so why misrepresent yourself with wearing bland or stereotypical clothing?</p>
<p>3. It takes around the same amount of effort finding pretty clothes as run-of-the-mill clothes. </p>
<p>4. It might make an easier transition between wearing clothes only because of their comfort no matter the appearance and dressing in business casual as many of us will have to. </p>
<p>5. I personally sew much of my own clothing, and I&#8217;d rather sew clothes that are pretty, not boring. </p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t want to be the sort of person who takes pictures of their outfits to see how photogenic they are or who keeps a clothing calender to make sure people don&#8217;t see them in the same dress twice. I feel my energy is better spent elsewhere. Will the fact that a certain person saw me wearing the same dress twice be so important to me thirty years later? I hope not.</p>

<p>Zephyr said:  &#8220;Because someday when you have a 9-5 corporate job and are required to wear business suits, you’re going to miss the freedom of dress you had in college. Experiment now! There’s no better time.&#8221;</p>
<p>YES.  I live in the 9-5 corporate world and let me tell you &#8211; it&#8217;s frickin&#8217; boring.  I&#8217;m not required to wear suits, and it actually makes it even more difficult to dress professionally AND be happy with what I&#8217;m wearing.  For 8 hours a day, when I sit in a cubicle and feel like my life is run by the corporate overlords, I like to do whatever it takes to feel like my own person.  Let&#8217;s face it: we present ourselves to the world in a variety of ways, one of which is our appearance.  I celebrate beauty in everything from flowers to a child&#8217;s smile to the generosity of a friend.  ***There&#8217;s no reason to feel guilt or shame for wanting to look as beautiful as you know you are on the inside.***  Coworkers have looked at me askance for wearing overly trendy things to the office.  My direct supervisor is a beautiful intelligent woman who is unfortunately somewhat of a fashion hater.  Everything around me tells me to blend in and toe the line, but the more pressure I feel to conform, the more I feel like doing the opposite.</p>
<p>I do dress within the business casual rules set out by our HR, but each day I also dress to make myself happy and present a confident persona to the world that tells me to be just average.  I don&#8217;t resist that with looks alone, but knowing that I look as competent and confident as I feel definitely helps.</p>
<p>Being a part-time college student, I also have to resist the urge to change into jeans and sweatshirts after work to feel like part of the crowd on campus, but THAT is just too much work (unless I&#8217;m dying to try out my new skinny jeans!) and now I just attend the lectures in my office attire and let everyone stare away.</p>
<p>End of story: know yourself, be happy with who you are, and represent THAT, whether it&#8217;s in a fancy dress with heels or ripped jeans with an AE tank.  If you don&#8217;t care about appearances, all the power to you, but don&#8217;t put down others who do.  Just never make any decisions that arise out of fear.</p>
<p>Rock on, sistas.</p>

<p>great post! I totally agree.. dressing up everyday gives you a little something more to look forward too.. so what if people stare right? what&#8217;s important is that you feel great about yourself :D</p>

<p>This is such a great article.  As a mother of four kids under ten, it&#8217;s all too easy to fall into the sweats and sweatshirt, pony tail and fast (if any) make up look that somehow becomes the entire day&#8217;s wear.  Sure, we plan to change into something nicer when we get done dropping off kids or doing that quick errand, but then once home, there&#8217;s reading the mail, returning calls, laundry, chores and somehow, that outfit without the waistband is still on.</p>
<p>I realized this was happening to me by my third child.  I was great at getting to the gym after each child to get back my body.  The work out was great for mind, body and spirit.  I realized, why do I have to look like I am in work out clothes all day every day even though I do work out?  I decided to make a change.</p>
<p>I went to TJ Max, Target, Kohl&#8217;s, and stores where I could find bargain slacks&#8211;yes, with a waist band and even belt at times, and started buying a few items here and there with&#8211;YES, button down shirts that were, get this, for no reason other than to add layer, color, depth and warmth.  I found other moms, even dads at times looking at me.  &#8220;Oh you look nice today,&#8221; I would be told.  &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;  In the beginning, I actually said, &#8220;Oh, meeting my Dad for lunch.&#8221;  Where and why that came out of my mouth, I don&#8217;t know.  It took two more years of doing this outfit deal, 75% of the time, before being straight and saying, &#8220;You know, I&#8217;m just sick of looking like a mom of four kids who owns no clothes with waist bands.  The habit of being pregnant, pre and post.&#8221;  I would tell other women, try it, and they did.  I found myself asking, &#8220;Are you going somewhere?  You look so nice.&#8221;  My best answer was &#8220;No, just doing what you gave me the guts to do.  Look good for myself.&#8221; Andrea</p>

<p>This was a really good article. I love to dress up, I dress up almost every school day. It feels really good when you dress up and someone is not wearing the same thing as you, It makes you feel diffrent but in the good way, It&#8217;s also a good way to get noticed. My younger sisters hate it when I dress up for school, but I LOVE IT!!</p>

<p>I think that Coco Chanel said it in such a cute way:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand how a woman can leave the house without fixing herself up a little &#8211; if only out of politeness. And then, you never know, maybe that&#8217;s the day she has a date with destiny. And it&#8217;s best to be as pretty as possible for destiny.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are others, but:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they remember the woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Omg, people ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS ask me why I&#8217;m so &#8220;dressed up&#8221; and sometimes i just &#8220;answer&#8221; with a polite smile and a thank you&#8230; even though the way they say it isn&#8217;t meant as a compliment, at all. Other times when I&#8217;m not in such a good mood i just say.. &#8220;umm, i&#8217;m not dressed up&#8221; cause half the time i honestly don&#8217;t think i am! I mean maybe my definition of casual and other people&#8217;s is just completely different&#8230; For example when I&#8217;m dressed really casual i usually wear a simple cute jersey dress, one that i can just throw on and pair with some sandals or flats and go. Every time i wear stuff like that people think I&#8217;m dressed up&#8230; however, i don&#8217;t think i am.<br />
I guess it&#8217;s cause i refuse to walk around in sweats and t-shirts so my replacement for that are my &#8220;lazy dresses&#8221; the same one&#8217;s that other people wear when they are &#8220;dressed up&#8221;.<br />
When i do dress up, i wear nice fancy dresses and even if they are completely appropriate for the occasion people always tell me i look &#8220;so dressed up&#8221;.</p>
<p>Whatever. I like to look nice and i will continue to &#8220;dress up&#8221; EVERYDAY!</p>

<p>i agree with the first poster~!! i&#8217;m only 18 and i&#8217;m STILL getting asked &#8220;where you going?&#8221; , &#8220;whats the occasion?&#8221; &#8220;date tonight?&#8221; but once you&#8217;ve seen the person a few times, they get the drift. its just you. i like clothes, and to me, its not dressed up. blouses, blazers, dresses, coats, these aren&#8217;t fancy. they&#8217;re everyday wear ^^ i can rock a tee and jeans too, im just not a slave to it.<br />
whats wrong with high heels and boots? i LIKE leather, i don&#8217;t need a reason to dress nice.<br />
and frankly, since i&#8217;m not a mall-rat, EVERY ONE thinks im much older &gt;;3<br />
I was 15 being mistaken for 20-sumthin. hehe so i snagged all the handsome older men while everyone i knew where peddling the teeny-boppers.<br />
hmmmmm delicious~!!! now i&#8217;m legal, i can say my real age, but i still masquerade as a 26 year old waitress lolol just anouthre plus, girls~</p>

I loved it, and I&#8217;m gonna dress up for college now, and I don&#8217;t care about the weird looks I get. I love getting ready for nights out, so why can&#8217;t I enjoy getting ready for college?!?</p>

<p>I love this post! my mom always encourages me to dress up. (to be honest I only own two T-shirts, the rest is blouses and dresses). I love to look different, to &#8216;pop&#8217; out of the usual grayness. Beside, dressing up for yourself means you love being yourself; expressing your own unique style with confidence to the world. And like Coco Chanel said, &#8216;it&#8217;s only polite&#8217;. Celebrate everyday! :D</p>

<p>the way I see it, I dress up for parties, for dates, obviously for boys I´m interested in, so why not dress up for me. I dress up for church, because if I can do it for a guy I can do it for God too. If you start doing it for yourself and what matters to you, you won´t care what people think, and people will notice the confidence. It´s not hard, its been said, it only takes one item to do it, make a statement!</p>
<p> So I´m REALLY looking forward to dressing up for University this September haha!</p>

<p>Ah Zephyr, you are really too wonderful! Thank you for the mention :)</p>
<p>I love the reason about &#8220;trying out looks&#8221; so you can make fashion faux-pas. It&#8217;s not about getting it right every time. It&#8217;s about being fearless.</p>
<p>And, of course, it&#8217;s about looking good juuuust in case you see that someone you&#8217;d want to impress. Why dress normally when you can always dress fabulously?</p>

<p>Great post :)</p>
<p>Another reason: this is kind of shallow, but think about which girl the guys are going to notice. Is it the girl who looks exactly like everyone else? Or the girl whose outfit makes her stand out visually because of its different colors and styles, and shows off her, ahem, &#8220;assets&#8221; in a way that sweats never will? </p>
<p>And that attention could lead to more confidence, which leads to more fabulous outfits &#8211; everybody wins!</p>

<p>Wonderful post :D </p>
<p>I dress up because I LOVE to be unique (and to be honest, I also love the attention I get).<br />
Where I live, everyone dresses in  tanktops, shorts and flip flops. Its really plain and more importantly its not me.<br />
I love to wear bright colours, tutus, Doc Martens, high-waisted skirts and other things ppl here don&#8217;t usually wear on a &#8220;normal&#8221; day.  And when I dress in simple clothing such as Tees and skinny jeans, I usually dress it up with bright heels or a sparkly hat.</p>

<p>Fashion is social! Sometimes your friends want permission to relax and not worry about how they look, but if you look fabulous, it&#8217;s pressure for other women to try harder. The list above includes &#8220;life is too short&#8221; but my life is too short to spend extra time and money searching for unusual clothes and time every day putting them together. Find some cute cheap tops, jeans or slacks, done! If you feel you don&#8217;t have money for [vacation, great gift for mom, student loans, charity] try skipping all unnecessary clothes/accessories purchases for a couple of months. You won&#8217;t care about those fabulous earings when you&#8217;re on a beach [or when your mom is, or someone has food who otherwise wouldnt, etc].</p>

<p>I&#8217;m heading from an all-girls high school with a uniform to a co-ed college where I can wear whatever I want, so I&#8217;m just starting to get into fashion. I haven&#8217;t been asked why I&#8217;m dressed up (yet), but I have been worried about feeling self-conscious about what I&#8217;m wearing. Thanks for the article, and your whole blog really. It&#8217;s been a great help in developing my college style!</p>

<p>OK LADIES and you boys out there,</p>
<p>firstly, dressing up doesn&#8217;t have to be for any one but YOU. I LOVE dressing up, not because i like to SHOW people i am dressing up, but because, hell, as cliche as it sounds it makes me feel good. Taking as little as 30 mintues after a good shower every morning just to &#8220;prim&#8221; myself, wear good clothes makes me leave that front door feeling like a million bucks, and that translates into how my day begins and how I feel.</p>
<p>So, with me feeling fabulous, I am consequently more confident, do a better job, and I KNOOOOW people are gona probably squirm at the idea of this, but its true &#8221; Good looking people are treated better&#8221; ok it doesn&#8217;t even have to do with good looks, but the fact that some one takes care of themseves reflects a lot on the person. </p>
<p>and hey, like the article mentions, you never know if Prince charming may bump into you on your way back from class.!</p>
<p>Call me an idealist/romantic, ITS TRUE!</p>

<p>I completely agree! I dress up anytime I leave the house. For me, it gives me the energy to get out and do things instead of being sluggish all day long. Plus, it really doesn&#8217;t take much longer to throw on a dress and some accessories than it does to put on sweats and a sweatshirt. There&#8217;s no excuse!</p>

<p>I think many of the trouble between fashion lovers and people who don&#8217;t think of it is a great misunderstanding. I think the question &#8220;why to dress up&#8221; is not that offencive, i think of it as genuene interest. It is like two different worlds, i try to convert to the fashion love site, and therefore i find it hard when you think of it as a question that was ment to provoke. How about saying &#8220;because i like to look my best&#8221;, that is the often the trouth, so why try to justify with all these reasons</p>

<p>BTW i really understand awkward grinnellian, i read somewhere ( i do not reamember where:( ) a statement saying that noone should buy a 10.000 $ bag, when a third of the world population is starving.<br />
I am not saying that grinnellian is starving, but since i have gone to private school without being rich. I know, its totally the Jenny Humpfrey story, except in my case it broke my self confidence.</p>
<p>However i LOVE dressing up and it can be done at a reallatively low budget, but it is not worth waisted self confidence, money problems or any of that sort.</p>
<p>And I understand that most fashion lovers are really smart, it is a buisness always changing, but i have also read that more young people in America wants to be beautiful than being smart. Have we gone too far, when we all want to be dumb blonds? ( no offense, Marilyn Monroe was actually very smart)</p>

<p>Um, last time I checked you do not have to spend a lot of money on clothes to look good.<br />
Also, you ARE going to college to expand your mind and not your wardrobe but I would hope that you have a hobby on the side! Some people like to play sports in their free time, others like to draw. Well, some people like me care about fashion.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really not that hard to comprehend&#8230;</p>

<p>This makes me soooooo mad.  I get asked this almost every day.  Especailly when I was still in college.  Now that I work a full-time corporate job, my co-workers count down the days till casual Friday.  It just makes me laugh.</p>
<p>I grew up in Chicago where people usually dress up for the most part.  Now I live in Minnesota where everyone wears jeans and a sweatshirt.  It bothers me so much! Errrr! Good to see others have the smae feelings!</p>

<p>Hey !<br />
This post was so great ! I&#8217;m really happy to see that i&#8217;m not the only one who get asked that same boring question about my look when i go to school. </p>
<p>But I was wondering, I know you were talking a lot about college and everything but I wanted to know how you feel about dressing up in High School (I&#8217;m a Sophomore). I love wearing heels and dresses and blazers but sometimes i really feel out of place ! In your opinion Zephyr, is it too much to dress up in high school ?</p>

<p>Great reasons &#8211; I strongly believe in that. Every girl should dress up every day, no matter the occasion. Every girl should try to look her best. No matter how we feel &#8211; if we are sad, hurt or bored &#8211; women should look beautiful every minute!</p>

<p>I go to a 90% woman&#8217;s university, and me and my friend flaunt ourselves in dresses and heels every day. We&#8217;re both health science majors, so even the days we have labs, we wear nice jeans and cute tops. The girls envy us. The girls love us. The guys love us even more. We feel confident, and everyone knows who we are. :]</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe dressing up is that important. Jobs don&#8217;t require you to wear the bussiness suit. But I&#8217;m very capable expressing myself through how I dress. I&#8217;d rather wear band shirts and hoodies than skirts and dresses. That&#8217;s just me though.</p>

<p>Ever heard of being sick or having your period? Ever just not want to pour all of your conscious attention of your physical appearance? I think its vein, you should be able to feel good about yourself no matter how you look.</p>

<p>&#8220;dressed up&#8221; is not synonymous with &#8220;looking good&#8221;.  You can look cute and fabulous without wearing clothes that are inappropriate to a situation.  I don&#8217;t dress up for school, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t put effort into my appearance.  It&#8217;s not called dressing up when you&#8217;re wearing your favorite boots, dark wash jeans, a blazer with a pretty cami and a scarf, which is a perfectly non dressed up yet cute option for school.</p>

<p>so true, i also get the &#8220;why are you so dressed up question&#8221; all the time, i do it because i like to, i enjoy it, and it in general makes me feel better for the day ahead.  To the people that say it gets rid of the class distinction between those who can afford designer labels and those who can&#8217;t, i say designer labels aren&#8217;t the only thing that can look good, i will openly say i buy most of my things second hand or from walmart or other lower priced places and always come out looking good or as good as anyone who purchases a similar item from a brand name or designer store.</p>

<p>I totally agree with you guys, you dont have to buy expensive clothing in order to look good, its how you dress the clothes up and wear them! The dress i get most complimented on was $4 from the salvation army. Pretty much all my clothes are, but i&#8217;m pretty picky so i only get the good pieces. Its all in the way you put the clothes together. A guy i know commented that he&#8217;s never seen me wearing the same thing. I wear the same thing all the time, i just dress it up differently! A good outfit makes a whole day better! And dressing up is so much fun that its a waste of a good time not to!<br />
Thanks for this post!</p>

<p>Bandit a la mode. I completely understand what you mean by being sick and worst of all being on your period. Cuz when that time of the month comes around I bloat up like a balloon lol and i never feel like doing anything, but i have to. I just put on a cute basic top with some jeans and some nice looking flats and that&#8217;s it (and pop a midol lol) but being sick or on your period shouldn&#8217;t really be an excuse to not look nice. And trying to look nice isn&#8217;t vain at all (if you just name drop and act snobby and don&#8217;t care about anyone else) and get most of my clothes from goodwill.</p>

<p>&#8211;I read somewhere that fashion allows us to be monogamous while still experiencing variety<br />
&#8211;I dress up to amuse myself, give others something nice to look at, express myself, and to be creative<br />
&#8211;There are a lot of people in here, and they all want their own wardrobe!</p>

<p>Wow &#8211; this post is soo awesome! I may send it on to my friends to read :) </p>
<p>Ever since I went to university I&#8217;ve been more daring in what I wear and really make an effort most days &#8211; it makes me feel so pretty and confident! I remember one of my flatmates (who is a boy) told me that I should &#8216;just dress comfy&#8217; &#8211; but looking good doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m not comfy! (boys &#8211; tsk!) </p>
<p>Anyway, this post has really encouraged me to keep looking pretty! Thanks &#8211; I stumbled across this website through Google and even though this is an American website (I&#8217;m from Scotland), I definitely shall return! Keep up the fabulous work!</p>

<p>LOVE this post (as always)! Maybe &#8220;dress up&#8221; was misleading for some of you, so replace that &#8220;give a darn about how you look&#8221;. Also, another really great reason &#8230; &#8220;Because I wanted to!&#8221; That&#8217;ll shut them down rather immediately. </p>

<p>I dress up because it makes me feel pretty, feminine, girlish, soft and sweet and it instills in me a wholeness, peace and contentment that I could never get from being a boy. I always wear a dress or skirt and heels or cute boots, take all the time I need to ensure my makeup is flawless and my outfit and accessories all work together beyond any doubt for the simple reason: it is what I live for; my total Zen nirvana; the core of my being and the seat of my soul. I would not even consider settling for less because if I am going to wear pants and sneakers I may as well be a boy and I&#8217;m sorry, but to me being a boy is the most dull, boring, and lifeless existence there is. I was blessed with feminine facial features so I pass as a natal/anatomical girl extremely well and do so more and more as time and my estrogen and anti-androgen regimen continues so in a skirt or dress I&#8217;m almost always the most well dressed and dressed up &#8216;girl&#8217; wherever I go. When I look my female best I always get compliments about what I&#8217;m wearing and how I look and there is nothing more powerful than sincere compliments to infuse me with girlish delight, reinforce my femininity and confirm that my true gender is and has always been female. What else rocks my world?: having a natal/anatomical female address me as &#8220;Sweetie&#8221; and treat me as &#8216;just&#8217; one of the girls; being hit on by a straight guy.</p>

<p>This article is amazing! I love it. Me and my friends just love to dress up and look good. I go to Target/Walmart/ Safeway pretty much any grocery store looking like I could easily end up at a concert!<br />
Makes me feel good about myself ( and yes also the attention from other people, c&#8217;mon nobody can deny that everyone craves a lil bit of fashion attention!)<br />
Awkward Grinnellian- I understand what you are saying about going to college, being on scholarships and working hard to get through college. Believe me I am in college! But fashion isn&#8217;t always about going to Bebe or DKNY or anything like that. Its about showing/displaying who you are and what you are about. The way a person dresses up actually says a lot about their personality and their behaviour in general. You don&#8217;t have to have $500 jeans to be able to fit into the fashion group. Mix and match and pair up whatever you have. That is exactly how you are showcasing yourself. And put that fashion statement with a brilliant mind and you&#8217;ve got a winner!</p>

<p>Plus, it seems that it&#8217;s mainly in the monetarily &#8220;richer&#8221; countries that people dress very casually/sloppily.  It is not classist or vain/decadent to try to express onself or look nice.  In most countries around the world this is a normal thing to do, and it is polite.  It has nothing to do with money.  </p>
<p>Anyhow, generic mall-brand clothing is much more expensive than recycled secondhand clothes, and of course the mall/chain store clothes are not as well-made as anything sewn yourself.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons I started dressing up. Other reasons were Gossip Girl and What Not to Wear. My friends totally have that mentality of &#8220;maybe we should focus less on what people wear and more on the people inside the clothes&#8221;. I was like that too. I thought, &#8220;School&#8217;s wayyy more important than clothes and makeup. I want to be comfortable.&#8221;  Then my dad asked me one time whether I liked myself. </p>
<p>That was about 3 years ago, and it was just now that I realized&#8211; people have eyes. We &#8220;should&#8221; focus on the inside, but how can someone know the inside if the outside sends the wrong message and drives people away? Dressing up (not like wearing a fancy cocktail dress, but merely looking neat and polished) shows you care and love yourself and you know that you deserve to feel beautiful and happy. Who DOESN&#8217;T feel happy when they feel beautiful? And what is that but CONFIDENCE? That&#8217;s what people- esp. potential employers- look for. And just because everyone else decides to give up and grudgingly walk to class feeling tired and full of self-pity, doesn&#8217;t mean I have to. </p>
<p>Dressing up shouldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Oh world, look at my fancy clothes, look at my designer logos (SO tacky), look at all the glitz and glamour&#8230;.&#8221; </p>
<p>It&#8217;s supposed to say, &#8220;Look at ME.&#8221;</p>

<p>Class distinction&#8211; why would anyone stress over comparing themselves to someone else? Who cares what THEY&#8217;RE wearing? I don&#8217;t let that intimidate me anymore.</p>
<p>Those who show off designer labels truly have low self-esteem. It&#8217;s a different kind of low self-esteem. They need to show off to feel rich and fabulous. Why would I buy $100 dollar dresses when I could get them (if I get creative) for $10? I save $90, and that&#8217;s being SMART. And no offense to Coach lovers but the brown Coach bags with the Cs all over them are DISGUSTING. </p>
<p>I hate the &#8220;I&#8217;m too poor&#8221; excuse because that&#8217;s what it is&#8211; an excuse. And a very good friend of mine uses that excuse all the time. Those in America (me included) are blessed that compared to other countries, staples like food and clothes are relatively affordable, even if you have to go to secondhand stores. My uncle and guy cousin had to share ONE leather jacket&#8211; and it&#8217;s freezing in the UK, where they live. They had to wait until they could buy from the US last year. Because of the euro everything there is double what it is here. </p>
<p>How would anyone in class or even your professor know your brilliance if you don&#8217;t have the confidence to speak up? Feeling good about yourself because you know you&#8217;re beautiful and smart gives that confidence.</p>
<p>We also go to college to develop ourselves as individuals, and as people ready to take on the world, not just our minds. </p>
<p>Yes there are people who don&#8217;t have as much resources. That doesn&#8217;t stop them from trying to look their best, from getting up at 2am just to pump water so they can bathe themselves and be clean. If someone is blessed with what resources they have and doesn&#8217;t look their best, THAT&#8217;s a waste of money. It&#8217;s what my parents had been trying to teach me all along.</p>

<p>@ rachel (#80):<br />
&#8220;Fashion is social! Sometimes your friends want permission to relax and not worry about how they look, but if you look fabulous, it’s pressure for other women to try harder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Behavior is social! Try applying that to college education or etiquette. If everyone in college had permission to relax (in terms of education), who would bother trying? Who would excel? Pressure shouldn&#8217;t necessarily be a bad thing. It can show us what we&#8217;re capable of achieving. </p>
<p>Who would argue that life is too short to spend extra time and money for a good university? Go to the cheapest community college, done! How far would the easy route take you? Please note that I have the highest respect for community colleges and a lot of my friends attend them. I&#8217;m just saying that trying harder enables us to grow.</p>

<p>It need not be empirically proven that dressing up makes you FEEL GOOD!</p>
<p>I revel in fashion, and savour every fibre, seam, and split! It doesn&#8217;t make sense to me that you should &#8220;save an item for later&#8221;. I wear what I want because I can &#8211; it makes me feel confident and powerful. If you stash away the goodies &#8211; you&#8217;ll never have time to enjoy them, and there&#8217;s no fun in that. I live for the moment!</p>
<p>Fashion is an art. Its an expression of self &#8211; defining WHO you are and the person you KNOW you can be! People naturally &#8220;project&#8221; an image of themselves and you&#8217;re only kidding yourself if you think &#8220;first impressions&#8221; factor none of this in.</p>
<p>I should note however that I&#8217;m also not one of those people that just wakes up and &#8220;throws shit together&#8221;. It takes time and experimentation to achieve the look in my head. And as a science student (defying our bad fashion rep)&#8230; lab simply does not permit the wearing of nicer clothes. Well technically you could, but it would be stupid to do so! So on some days &#8211; I won&#8217;t dress up. And it&#8217;s a different kind of sexy. I&#8217;m comfortable and unashamedly &#8220;regular&#8221;.</p>
<p>It saddens me to think that anyone would shame someone else into thinking they are any lesser for daring to be different.  And as in most life circumstances, this is probably due to a misunderstanding. It is good to be different and as you get older, you begin to appreciate this more. People will naturally gravitate to people that stimulate them &#8211; be it brilliant minds, creative skills or unwavering diligence.</p>
<p>Just remember that being criticised is bad &#8211; but succumbing to convention for the sake of fear is much worse. Its a righteous justification and always pervades my thoughts. Do not be sheep &#8211; and if you must &#8211; be the red one!</p>
<p>I have come to the conclusion, that really&#8230;</p>
<p>I AM just a bit fancy. And you probably are too! =)</p>

<p>I almost shed a tear when I read this wonderful post! It&#8217;s so totally true! </p>
<p>I used to dress up a lot and put a lot of effort in my outift, because it&#8217;s true that feeling confident about your look is a great feeling. But then we moved, from a fairly big and &#8216;fashion-aware&#8217; city (Antwerp) to a small province town where I get stared down for wearing anyhting else than jeans and a tee&#8230; But no more! I&#8217;m going to stop caring what everyone in this hick town thinks and start wearing all those beautiful clothes again!</p>

<p>hi there! i belong to dehradun, india and right now pursuing my b.tech. it makes me really sad that i am still not able to decide that what actually should i wear for my college. i am about to become 19 and my height is 5.7, average built. obviously mostly rather all the girls here wear suits(you must hav seen most of the indian girls wearing it), jeans and a t-shirt or top and i am tired wearing all this stuff. please suggest me what should i wear for my college which would b cool. remind you that we cant wear stuff which goes shorter than even our knee. it would be perfectly very kind of you if would tell something which will go ausum with jeans only but will give a smart look and dont forget to suggest some suitable accesssories also. nw a days monsoon is waiting to come over here but suggest some stuff for summers also. i really really want to know this. please answer as soon as possible. i will be highly greatful.</p>

<p>i save this post in my favorites so i can always refer back to it for reassurance &amp; to remember why i continue to love fashion.</p>
<p>i cant stand the boys who criticize fashionable girls or the girls who are too scared to try something new who criticize the girls who aren&#8217;t. so many people are intimidated by a woman with confidence. i gain my confidence from trying new looks, expressing who i am, and making fashion mistakes! </p>
<p>i dress the way i do because i love how it feels. i love feeling classy and chic. i love walking into a room and feeling bright. i seriously just love how fashion makes me feel!</p>
<p>and i don&#8217;t care what anyone thinks!!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so late on this but, I not only love the article but the comments as well. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ever save anything for a special occasion, every day you are alive is a special occasion&#8221; I marvel at the simple and deep truth of that statement. Also, &#8220;Because I can wear anything that pleases me&#8221; is delicious, in fact, I think I&#8217;ll say that to the people who pose that annoying question at school, but since I&#8217;m from Texas and fifteen years old I&#8217;ll probably say &#8220;Porque me puedo poner lo que me den las ganas&#8221; or &#8221; Because I can wear whatever the hell I feel like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hi! I just found your site a few weeks ago and I am in love with this stuff!!<br />
Great job, this is the best one I&#8217;ve seen yet&#8230;anyway, this article is really meaningful to me, because my husband is always irritated about what he calls my &#8221;vanity&#8221;&#8230;.so now I finally have some powerful statements on my side! </p>
<p>I&#8217;m 22, with a 2 year old son, and for my whole life I was a tomboy. My first year in college, I would do my hair and makeup&#8230;and then put on jeans. Then, during late pregnancy [summertime], all I could fit into were dresses, and I built up quite a collection. </p>
<p>So, once I lost my baby weight [except in the boobs and hips for whatever reason...awesome!], I decided that, hey, I look really great, and since I&#8217;ve always thought women had this feminine, beauty-power type advantage over men&#8230;I realized I should be living proof of that!! </p>
<p>Now I try super hard to only wear dresses out&#8230;or skirts with leggings, plus I&#8217;m building my heels collection&#8230;I got myself some white leather wedges with a lacy cutout this summer, and it was worth it even more for each compliment! I love it!<br />
Some people do make rude comments or stare, but I just ignore&#8230;I mean, I knew I was challenging people when I got dressed this morning, where were you, in rude-sloppylop land? Must have been&#8230;<br />
[At least, I never say, why are you so NOT dressed up? Because it's rude right? Ok... &gt;.&lt; ]</p>
<p>And as further proof, I can think of at least 1 pair of pants and 1 skirt that get compliments EVERY time I wear them&#8230;and I&#039;ve had them both since high school!</p>
<p>I struggle with guilt for this &#039;&#039;vanity&#039;&#039;, but hell, it just makes the whole day better, from the moment you step out the door!!</p>
<p>My father always said mockingly of &#039;&#039;impractical fashion&#039;&#039; [i.e. flipflops/mini skirts in december etc.], that to those girls it&#039;s not how you feel, but how you look&#8230;which to some extent I agree with&#8230;<br />
but now, I also know that it&#039;s actually ALL about how I feel!! Which, if I can help it, will be &#039;&#039;Fabulous yet Functional&#039;&#039;, as often as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks so much and keep up the good work!</p>

<p>In the words of Dita Von Teese (who is a personal inspiration, with her gorgeous vintage style): &#8220;It&#8217;s actually a compliment to be mocked for being different. They never pick on the mediocre&#8221;. Dare to be different! Don&#8217;t blend in into the crowd. Wear what makes you feel fabulous, and to hell with the naysayers.</p>

<p>Great article!  I really enjoyed reading these &#8220;reasons to dress up&#8221;.  I couldn&#8217;t agree more!</p>
<p>I think deciding on whether to dress up or not is like deciding on whether or not you want to have a good day or a bad day.  :-)  </p>
<p>Oh yeah, and dont think you have to wear boring business suits when you get a 9-5 job!  Think of Elle Woods in Legally Blonde as an example. :-)  When I worked corporate, I wore the cutest clothes!  I work for myself now, so my wardrobe has dramatically changed.  Your wardrobe should always reflect your lifestyle though.  I am glad I got to experiment with &#8220;9-5&#8243; clothes, and now i&#8217;m glad I am evolving and experimenting with new styles.</p>
<p>Soon, i&#8217;ll be travelling around the country for a year.  I&#8217;m sure my style will evolve again.  That&#8217;s the fabulous thing about style; you get to experiment and change it up all the time b/c its a living breathing thing b/c its a reflection of you!</p>
<p>Kudos!  Good post!</p>

<p>I actually agree with some of your reasons.<br />
I disagree that I had my best body when I was younger.<br />
And I don&#8217;t dress up because I am a muralist and an interior painter.<br />
It sucks to get paint and drywall compound on silk.<br />
And you will not find me climbing any ladders in a skirt.</p>

<p>My hobby: visit NY Lookbook every time I am with my computer. I love to get inspired from others&#8217; fashion. </p>
<p>This article and comments make my day bright. I am a college student in PA. I am an international student. My first impression on American college kids is &#8220;Why are those girls so lazy to dress up everyday?&#8221; Dressing up every day is my passion. You meet new people everyday and  you want to show a good impression by dressing good clothes. I got SO SHOCKED by girls wearing pajamas and not matching tops w/ bottoms. It is mysterious why they do not care people watching them. </p>
<p>I feel sometimes left out and weird because I am the only one who dresses up everyday. I am pretty sure it depends on what school you go to. I go to a huge public university though. But I got the idea that the school is not in the fashion-friendly atmosphere. (Not NYC). </p>
<p>My bottom quote: &#8220;Fashion is what you are offered four times a year. Style is what you pick out of that fashion. It is what you make of it once you have learned what to accept and ignore based on what looks good on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I love this article, period.</p>

<p>Finally somebody pointed this out =] Great posts! At my school the majority of the people look the same. When I first wore heels to school I felt nervous because everybody there wore converse. It felt good though because I knew my outfit looked better with heels then trainers. A girl said to me in break &#8220;I like your shoes but I&#8217;d never wear heels to school because it&#8217;s so dressed up&#8221; To be honest I felt a little put on the spot but just went away. Now a year later, last day of school before the christmas holiday, about 4 people wore heels for the first time to school &#8211; including that girl. Sometimes you&#8217;ve just got to put yourself out there and just get confidence. Just because you&#8217;re worried about people&#8217;s opinion, why don&#8217;t you wear that one thing you want to?! I was always worried but in the end if you&#8217;re worried like I was and sometimes still are it stops you from leading a proper life and just fills you up with fear.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just glad to say that I over most of my fear of dressing up. I don&#8217;t own uggs &#8211; great for people who do, but I can&#8217;t justify myself on spending so much money on them, good for you if you can :)  I love the sales just as much as normal shopping! To me it doesn&#8217;t matter what it cost even though I don&#8217;t have lots of money to spend. I don&#8217;t own designer label clothes, I just buy clothes which make me happy. I&#8217;m glad my mum raised me to see the worth and value in things. I don&#8217;t think that fashion should be ruled by expensive prices and big names. I know everyone has their own opinion on fashion and so do I but some things which cost 200$ I wouldn&#8217;t buy for 30$..just my opinion!</p>
<p>Love the post =] x</p>

<p>oh yeah forgot to mention, I don&#8217;t have heaps of confidence. I&#8217;m quite a shy and quiet girl but still I like dressing up! I&#8217;m not model size, good for you if you are, but I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re body should rule your confidence. I have this horrible thing where I turn bright red in presentations or even when someone cute talks to me or even when I&#8217;m doing running in pe. I&#8217;ve had it since I was born and have nothing to do about it. It&#8217;s just the way I am, I can&#8217;t change it! I&#8217;ve never been a confident public speaker but that&#8217;s okay with clothes at least I can find some confidence. As my pe teacher one told me years ago &#8220;Red is a healthy colour!&#8221; I think we should just live with what you have, nobody is perfect even though it seems as they are.</p>

<p>I dress up because I&#8217;m cute and deserve to be clothe in things that are cute too. I have the brain and creativity to put an outfit together nicely, so there&#8217;s no reason for me not to dress up. Plus, when I dress up&#8211;which I do everyday&#8211;it gives me a confident booster which gives me an advantage of those who don&#8217;t try. That&#8217;s why I dress up. There&#8217;s no reason not to.</p>

<p>I googled &#8220;Why dress up&#8221;, this list came up, and it really made my day. I came back from a deployment in Afghanistan a month ago and I just wanted to feel like a girl again! So I bought a bunch of cute clothes and accessories and OMG shoes!!! Lol! But yesterday I got upset shopping at a local thrift store&#8230;everyone just stared and treated me like an outsider, asking if I was going on a date or a party. It made me feel like I should conform and wear sweats and sneakers everyday&#8230;why should I put effort into how I look if no one else in my town does? But then I read these wonderful reasons and it makes me feel much better! I&#8217;m printing them out and hanging them in my closet. I&#8217;m a soldier yes, but I&#8217;m a fashionista as well and these expensive accessories will NOT go to waste! Thanks!</p>

<p>A beautiful post. I agree with your 25 reasons for dress up. I used to think that I need a lot of money in order to have all the pretty clothes to wear and be pretty (so I keep myself low and be ugly) but now I believe dressing up everyday should be a woman&#8217;s priority (like you have mentioned life is too short and for that I am only going to live once and be young once why not embrace and celebrate my life the way I want it?) Now I&#8217;m just outing here searching for myself and I do think fashion is art-a way of expressing ourselves. Also believe that fashion does not have to be expensive but it is about creative&#8211;we could buy an expensive piece but if we do not know how to put it right to fit our body (it won&#8217;t look great too) and if we buy a cheap piece (and if we are creative enough the piece itself become rich)  </p>
<p>By the way, I&#8217;m just someone who just realizes about this and just start searching for her sense of style (I think it is going to take time to find what my style is and type of clothes for my body type)</p>
<p>Thanks for the great post.</p>

<p>I love this post so much! I have seriously looked through every comment because I&#8217;m about to go to college in a week and 1/2 and have heard that it is the norm to only wear sweats, baggy t-shirts, and even pajama bottoms! Since jr year of high school I had academic success but still remaining fashionable and I&#8217;m a girl and enjor dressing up! College should be no different and I&#8217;m seriously hanging up the post list in my college wardrobe! This reminds me of why I love fashion! thank you! and most of my clothing comes from thrift stores anyway and is still fashionable so being a fashionista is only vain and snobby if you let it; but so can other hobbies!</p>

<p>I love dressing up! Admittedly, sometimes I&#8217;ll have those days where I just feel like putting on sweats but I try to dress up every day. It makes me FEEL so much better:) I completely agree with you: I just don&#8217;t get why people think it&#8217;s weird to be dressed up. Sometimes it makes me feel uncomfortable but dressing up is SO worth it. Great post!<br />

<p>I love this! I currently go to a work program college where EVERYONE that goes is in dire need of the financial aid. Something cool that our school provides in every dorm is a &#8220;free box&#8221;. This box is for people in that specific dorm to put in clothing, shoes, things they don&#8217;t need or want, but will work for others well. I cannot tell you how much clothing we have coming in and out of those boxes-it feels like a shopping spree going from one dorms free box to the next. And it&#8217;s all FREE! Just makes sure you take whatever you know you don&#8217;t need anymore and put it in the box for others. I love it! </p>
<p>I definitely go to an all laid back type of school but really enjoy standing out by simply dressing up. Dressing up doesn&#8217;t even mean wearing heels and an expensive dress, it&#8217;s more about not dressing like everyone else-finding you&#8217;re style and working it. That&#8217;s what I consider dressing up! :)</p>

<p>LOVE this!! I totally agree. And it&#8217;s never too much of a hassle to throw on a super sute dress.</p>
<p>I dress up because of all these reasons. Also, I dress to inspire other people and to inspire myself. I find the way I dress can make people treat me differently. When you dress nice and not &#8220;I give up&#8221; people hold a certain, respect for you. I love dressing nicely. Occasionally I get the &#8220;You look out of place in that dress&#8221; etc. but I figure, &#8220;good, I stand out!&#8221;<br />
And there are some days when I don&#8217;t want to put a huge effort into wearing something other than jeans and a nice shirt, but thats when accessories (hello high heels!) come into play.<br />
Thanks for this article. Sharing it with everyong :P</p>

<p>I agree! Every time I go out, people are always like why are you wearing heels? Why are you wearing this? Why are you looking nice? I&#8217;m feed up with it. Not to sound arrogant, but is it really my fault I&#8217;m just good at picking out stylish clothes? What I wear is for myself, and I feel good when I wear nice things. So everyone else can can it. Thanks for posting this!</p>

<p>I get asked this like every single day. I&#8217;m from New York City, obviously a place known for its style, but have just started college in a small town in another state. In New York, I just wanted to leave the house looking nice. I&#8217;d throw on a skirt and kitten heels to go to the store. Nobody knew you had nowhere to go. Now I&#8217;ve kept my habits, but on an itty bitty campus, you&#8217;re obviously not going anywhere exciting. There are the people that ask me why I&#8217;m so dressed up (I commonly get the &#8220;you look like you&#8217;re going to work&#8221; comment, probably because the only jackets I have with me right now are blazers), but then there are the people that compliment me on consistently having such nice outfits, or even think I&#8217;m a model. One of my professors even said I&#8217;m their best dressed student.<br />
People say, don&#8217;t you just want to be comfy? But I can&#8217;t be comfortable in sweats and flip flops, because then I&#8217;m worried I look gross. I&#8217;m comfiest when I can rock a nice outfit and be confident.<br />
I&#8217;m not putting fashion before academics (in the honors program), I don&#8217;t spend hours getting ready (30 minutes tops), and it doesn&#8217;t cost a fortune. I own damn near zero designer clothes.</p>
<p>My common answer for &#8220;why are you so dressed up?&#8221; is &#8220;this is just how I dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Admittedly, I&#8217;m most afraid of people thinking I try too hard. But nobody seems to think that in New York.</p>

<p>I dress up because it feels good to look at yourself in the mirror. You are right! Life is too short so we have to enjoy it in a good way like dressing well. When you dress well , you look dignified. People respect you. I remember a friend of mine who went to one of the most popular skin store. He was just wearing slippers, shorts, and a T-shirt. He looks like a bystander. The salesperson was looking at him intently as if he&#8217;s going to steal something from the store not knowing that my friend was a manager of known restaurant. He can afford to buy their stuff. It&#8217;s not good to be judged by your looks but people are really judgmental.Lesson learned&#8230; dress a little bit better&#8230;^^</p>

<p>I like to dress up because I don&#8217;t want to look like everyone else in school; everyone wears Hollister Co. &amp; A &amp; F. I also dress up because you really don&#8217;t know who you may run into or what unexpected event may occur which may require you to dress a certain way. Dressing up also makes me feel good. I do feel overdressed at times but I like to stand out.</p>

<p>i began dressing up for school (sometimes!) when i read a quote spoken by Coco Chanel herself stating stating that she (Coco Chanel) cannot understand how women can leave the house without fixing herself a little even just out of politeness. i firmly believe and think that she is 100% right. how can you, as a girl, leave the house looking like you just got out of bed and didn&#8217;t even bother to wash your face and put on some decent clothes. and this is the main reason WHY i dress up for school. i mainly dress up for school because i want to look presentable and respectable in front of my professors.</p>

<p>I loved the point you made about cost per wear.</p>
<p>I have dresses that were for special occasions, but I dress them down with flat leather sandals so that I can wear them on the weekends during the day, too. I hate the fact that I spent, in some cases, over $200 for dresses that are only &#8220;dress up.&#8221; Forget it! Some sandals, a cardigan, or shawl and it&#8217;s casual.</p>
<p>When I lived in California, it wasn&#8217;t unusual that people would dress up. Now I live in Arkansas where, as you&#8217;ve described, everyone where&#8217;s sweat pants and hoodies. One woman, I know, is the epitome of frump. She&#8217;s been wearing the same sweatpants and hoodie for years, and sometimes everyday.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also like to add that when I lived in a bigger city, it was well known that if you go out and look like a bum, you&#8217;re not gonna get good service. In my experience, this is true. If you walk into a shop or a restaurant in sweats and a hoodie, in NYC, L.A., or any big city,  watch how fast people go out of their way to help you. </p>
<p>So, yeah, keep getting dressed up, even when you&#8217;re just going to the grocery store or laundry mat because, like the writer says, you never know who you&#8217;re gonna meet or where you&#8217;re gonna end up.</p>

<p>I know this is an old post, but I love it! Let&#8217;s add one more to this list, though?</p>
<p>Because it helps the economy.<br />
No, seriously. You know all those people talking about how demand creates jobs? This is especially true if you buy handmade goods.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just starting to get into this myself. I used to be/ still kinda am a person that asks &#8220;Why  in the heck are you all dressed up?&#8221; I attend an all woman&#8217;s college and that just seems to add to the list&#8230;. just no motivation. But agreeably you do feel better, and it IS a confidence builder. In a sea of sweats and hoodies you stand out, not only am I getting a top of the line education but im learning who I AM and what works for me. Which is the whole point of the whole college experience, right?</p>

<p>For the girl with the logo/graphic tee and Hollister issue (Kenadie, #159), try a blazer, some skinny jeans and knee high boots. Feeling a little more adventurous try out a body con skirt with a cardigan. All casual a cute outfits, a few accessories and anything came be made into a killer outfit. Work it and just be you whether its casual, girly, funky, classic, or chic.</p>

<p>I took Acting I, just so I would finally have a better excuse than &#8220;going to school&#8221; for dressing up (Ever heard of dress rehearsal?) So much fun! Seeing all the guys in suits? Priceless. We all looked amazing. I wish people did that a little more.</p>

<p>One more reason to dress up&#8230;you never know you may bump into your boyfren&#8217;s ex or your ex&#8217;s present&#8230;&#8230;so be ready gals&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Fashion for me if you say is formal business suit (I work in a corporate world-banking) and I seldom get to dress up. So i use it to the maximum possible but not always with designer clothes. My clothes range from designer brands to flea markets. It about mixing and matching, recycling your already owned clothes with accessories. So don&#8217;t fret&#8230;dress up gals&#8230;its really fun and confident booster. However great mind you have you will not be taken seriously if you dress laid back or shabby..its my personal experience in the corporate world.</p>

<p>I love this!!!! I&#8217;m only 13 and in elementary school i went from to tomboy,to girly,to blah. In middle school that&#8217;s when I got really into fashion,and honestly it&#8217;s the best choice I&#8217;ve ever made! In 6th grade I was more edgy, then in 7th I shifted from edgy with a few edgy pieces with a few girly pieces. Now I&#8217;ve definetley transformed into a more feminine style. EVERYONE here wears sweatpants,moccasins,and columbias. I do own a columbia and pair of moccasins but, then I accessorize and I definetley don&#8217;t do that everyday. Except for a few who wear a scarf or a&amp;f. At first, everyone judged me and still people look at me weirdly. I started to think a few mornings will people accept what I&#8217;m wearing? Then I realize I was letting people change me. And, I will never change for someone else. Noone has ever,ever worn high heels at my school and I was super nervous but it turned out I got lots of compliments and I felt confident. Also, I LOVE to wear bows its kind of my signature thing you&#8217;ll almost always see a bow incorperated with my outfit , which is always my fave part of the outfit. But, still there will be haters. In fact, there&#8217;s this one girl at my school who glares at me and hates me, because i&#8217;m too different. Which is kind of ironic because, she always wears the same outfits with the same accesories. But, the main message is be true to yourself. Do what makes YOU happy!</p>

<p>I agree with you! I love to dress up because it makes me different. Sure, I have those days where I look at &#8220;those&#8221; girls, wearing low-cut, tight-fitting Pink or Hollister shirts thinking how gorgeous they are, but then I remember how much more confidence I have, to go out there and be different! I&#8217;m surprised at all of the complete strangers that compliment my style, it feels great to have that!</p>
