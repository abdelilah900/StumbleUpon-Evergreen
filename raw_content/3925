<h2>Pomegranate Jam</h2>
<h4>November 25th, 2008&nbsp; | Category: <a href="http://cafefernando.com/fruit/" title="View all posts in Fruit" rel="category tag">Fruit</a>,  <a href="http://cafefernando.com/preserving/" title="View all posts in Preserving" rel="category tag">Preserving</a></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Pomegranate Jam" src="http://cafefernando.com/images/pomegranatejam5.jpg" alt="Pomegranate Jam" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>You really didn&#8217;t think I was done with <a title="Pomegranate Frozen Yogurt" href="http://cafefernando.com/pomegranate-frozen-yogurt/" target="_blank">pomegranates</a>, did you? I am amazed to hear how scarce this amazing fruit is in other parts of the world. A Turkish reader living in Germany said a pomegranate costs 2 Euros there!!! I am so lucky to be living in a city abundant with pomegranates. Did you know that pomegranates have more antioxidant power than cranberry juice or green tea?</p>
<p>Nowadays, I see pomegranates everywhere I turn. I juice two giant pomegranates every other day and drink it in the morning.  You already know I <a title="Pomegranate Frozen Yoghurt" href="http://cafefernando.com/pomegranate-frozen-yogurt/" target="_blank">fixed my ice cream craving</a> a couple of weeks ago. So, now what? Since pomegranates will not be around after a month or so, I preserved.</p>
<p><span id="more-266"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Pomegranate Jam 4" src="http://cafefernando.com/images/pomegranatejam2.jpg" alt="Pomegranate Jam 4" width="550" height="825" /></p>
<p>To tell you the truth, even tough Turkey is one of the native lands of this precious fruit, I have never heard of pomegranate jam or came across it in a jar in a supermarket aisle before. So I wondered, why don&#8217;t we choose to preserve pomegranates? Don&#8217;t they deserve to be bathed in sugar just like any other fruit? I still don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>But there is one thing I&#8217;m sure of: I will be preserving pomegranates for the rest of my life. The result was fantastic. So much so that I now claim this jam to be the most delicious jam that I&#8217;ve ever tasted. It is even better than the cherry jam my friend&#8217;s mom prepares that smells like chocolate (weird, but I swear it does).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Pomegranate Jam 3" src="http://cafefernando.com/images/pomegranatejam3.jpg" alt="Pomegranate Jam 2" width="550" height="825" /></p>
<p>I recommend using the seeds from one pomegranate and juicing the rest. The seeds are somewhat distracting to me and I certainly don&#8217;t want many of those on my buttered bread.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Pomegranate Jam 2" src="http://cafefernando.com/images/pomegranatejam1.jpg" alt="Pomegranate Jam 2" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only used freshly-squeezed pomegranate juice and sugar (with the addition of lemon juice at the end), so it takes a while for the jam to reach the desired consistency. At the end of an hour, you can do the plate test, which is basically dropping a spoonful of jam on a chilled plate and examining the consistency after you tilt the plate a bit. If the jam stays in a mound and not run, your jam is done. Enjoy.</p>
<div id="recipe">
<p><strong>POMEGRANATE JAM</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></p>
<p>Yields 3-4 cups</p>
<ul>
<li>3+1/2 cups freshly-squeezed pomegranate juice*</li>
<li>1 cup pomegranate seeds (from 1 large pomegranate)*</li>
<li>3 cups sugar</li>
<li>Juice of a lemon</li>
</ul>
<p>* You would need 5.5 pounds of pomegranates for 3+1/2 cups of juice and 1 cup of seeds.</p>
<p><em><strong>Method</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>Chill a small plate for testing the consistency of the jam later on.</li>
<li>Remove the seeds from one pomegranate and juice the rest. I advise not to use a juice press as the liquid from the seeds and membrane would result in a bitter taste. Here&#8217;s how I do it: Place a large bowl under the sink (for easy wash up), cut the pomegranates in half and while squeezing the pomegranate with one hand, press with your fingers inside the pomegranate with the other hand (the cut side will face the bowl) and extract as much juice as possible.</li>
<li>Combine pomegranate juice and sugar in a large pot over moderate heat. Stir frequently until the sugar dissolves, turn the heat to medium high and continue cooking for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Skim off the pink foam as necessary.</li>
<li>Add the pomegranate seeds and lemon juice and cook for another 10 minutes, then check for consistency by dropping a spoonful of jam on a chilled plate. When you tilt the plate, if it stays in a mound and not run, your jam is done. If it is still runny continue cooking and perform the test every 5 minutes (it always takes me an hour in total).</li>
<li>Fill your sterilized jars with the jam and store them in a dark, cool place.</li>
<li>Alternatively, cool the jam, uncovered, chill in an airtight glass container and store it in your refrigerator.</li>
</ol>

			<p>gorgeous! I would love to try this, but I also wonder as RecipeGirl about POM because pomegranates are so sinfully expensive, for no reason.  They are actually drying on the supermarket shelves.  What a waste.</p>

			<p>That looks great.  I had pomegranate once, but *if* you can find one here it&#8217;s at least $5 or $6.  And POM is ridiculous.  Definitely not something I can eat more than once every couple of years.</p>

<p>Thanks, Elise, for your site.</p>
<p>I really wish responders would withhold comments unless they try your recipes &#8211; don&#8217;t just share their stream of consciousness.  </p>

<p>Yes, the juice works and the recipe was great!</p>

			<p>Your photos are so striking and beautiful! We love pomegranates, but they&#8217;re pretty expensive here in NY (about $2.00 apiece on sale). Nevertheless, we indulge when they&#8217;re available, eating them through the Thanksgiving &#8211; Christmas season; they&#8217;re such a special fruit. You make them look like jewels here!</p>

			<p>Zoë François &#8211; Thank you!</p>
<p>RecipeGirl &#8211; I think it depends on the quality and type of the pomegranate juice. If it&#8217;s freshly squeezed and bottled, you might want to give it a try. If not, I&#8217;d recommend you to save your money and energy for another seasonal fruit.</p>
<p>Kristen &#8211; Drying on the shelves? Such a shame. Well, since they&#8217;re so expensive, I guess it would make more sense to eat them fresh rather than preparing a jam. Although, the latter lasts longer&#8230;</p>
<p>Jessie  &#8211; Thanks <img src='http://cafefernando.com/english/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Judith &#8211; $5 or $6? That&#8217;s a new record! </p>
<p>Ghille &#8211; They definitely add to the overall flavor, but seeds from one pomegranate is just enough. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend leaving any more seeds. </p>
<p>New York&#8217;s Delight &#8211; This one is a gift from a friend. She bought it from an antique shop in <a href="http://cafefernando.com/cukurcuma-a-hidden-treasure-for-antique-enthusiasts" rel="nofollow">Cukurcuma</a>, Istanbul. I guess your best bet would be ebay.</p>
<p>iwalk &#8211; Thank you!</p>
<p>Manggy &#8211; So true. It is almost impossible to get rid of pomegranate stain. </p>
<p>joey &#8211; Sorry! And thank you <img src='http://cafefernando.com/english/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Cynthia &#8211; Thank you. Hope you like it. </p>
<p>Sarah &#8211; Wish you could try.. Maybe you can halve the recipe and try a small batch? </p>
<p>Gera &#8211; Thank you! </p>
<p>Phyllis &#8211; Thanks for stopping by. Glad to read you liked the recipe!</p>
<p>Regarding your note about comments: I have nothing but space here. Isn&#8217;t that the beauty of blogging? Writing without any space constraints, sharing as many photographs as we like&#8230; I don&#8217;t think readers need to try the recipe before they comment on a post. Actually, for me, reading comments is half the fun! Some like to stop by and say hi, some compliment the bowl, some comment on the photos.. And I love reading them all!</p>
<p>juliette c. &#8211; I can&#8217;t agree more.</p>
<p>Lilly &#8211; Sure! I drink it every other day and will do so as long as they&#8217;re in season. </p>
<p>Gorkem Pacaci &#8211; Sorry to hear that!</p>
<p>Joy, Maya &#8211; Thank you.</p>
<p>Sandy S &#8211; Thank you. That&#8217;s exactly what my friend said yesterday: A bowl of rubies!</p>
<p>RC &#8211; Thanks for the information. I really need to learn more about canning. Do you have a favorite book on canning?</p>
<p>Esi &#8211; As I wrote above in response to Recipe Girl&#8217;s comment, I think it depends on the quality and type of the pomegranate juice. If it&#8217;s freshly squeezed and bottled, you might want to give it a try. If not, I&#8217;d recommend you to save your money and energy for another seasonal fruit. I am not sure about how long you can keep this in the refrigerator, but I&#8217;d assume it would be good or a month or two.</p>
<p>Si &#8211; Thank you!</p>

			<p>As always, very nice pictures. Never seen or tried pomegranate jam before. It&#8217;s a great idea. Pomegranates are $3 each at the markets around here in Houston. My dad tells me to schedule my vacation to Turkey in time for the pomegranate season since he has a few pomegranate trees. Not a bad idea.</p>

			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I name is Evelyne and I am from Montreal, Canada.<br />
I found your site while surfing the net and really enjoyed it. I love the articles and quality of your site. I linked your site to my food blog.</p>
<p>This coming March 2009 I will be celebrating my 2nd year of a dinner group I created. Its called Cheap Ethnic Eatz&#8230;well because we go to relatively cheap ethnic restaurants.<br />
Not long after its creation I started a blog to do reviews of places we have discovered and I also write the occasional article on food or cooking. I also built and am currently writing a website on World Ethnic Food DOT com.</p>
<p>I would very much like for you to consider adding my blog or website to you blog roll.<br />
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m curious, do you think heating the pomegranate causes it to lose some nutritional value? </p>

What a gorgeous photo of pomegranates and jam! I love everything pomegranate (and of course, being part Azeri, it must be in my blood, we use it in everything.) Actually, the only other time I heard of pomegranate jam was in the Arabian Nights, in the Story of the Two Viziers. &#8220;He prepared a pomegranate-seed dish, preserved in almonds and sweet julep and flavored with cardamom and rosewater&#8230;&#8221; </p>
<p>I also want to thank you for your post on Çiya. We went there when I was in Istanbul a couple of months ago, and we tried almost everything they had that day. I did save space for kerebic, which was amazing, especially the delicious mallow foam.</p>

I was wondering if you had a low sugar version, and I would like to try using sugar free pectin, after just 30 minutes of cooking the jam. What do you recommend on this.  Looking forward to your comment. d</p>

			<p>Doris &#8211; I have never tried a sugar free version of this pomegranate jam but as far as reducing the amount of sugar, feel free to do so if your pomegranates are extra sweet. Usually the ones with white or pink seeds are the sweetest.</p>

			<p>Easy local metghod for removing the arils.</p>
<p>I live out in Turkey on the Aegean coast in a place called Bodrum. I have a small tangerine grove with some beautiful, old pomegranate trees. I was recently show by an old village woman, how to remove the seeds or arils s they are called. After cutting open the fruit, you simply tap the outer skin with a large wodden spoon, whilst holding the half or quarter clump. The arils pop out with ease. Do this over a large bowel and in a short time you will have enough for juicing etc.</p>

			<p>hello<br />
I was fascinated by the idea of this jam so I tried it today. It stayed a lovely pink but did not jell when tested. By the time it jelled the color turned to a brownish color&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.not nice.<br />
what happened and why ?</p>

			<p>vrinda &#8211; I am not sure. Since you did the plate test, I can not think of a reason. Did you use the same amount of sugar (it helps with jelling)?</p>

			<p>Linda &#8211; I haven&#8217;t tried, so can&#8217;t say for sure, but pomegranate seeds are much harder than berries and I don&#8217;t see them releasing any juice unless you press with a wooden spoon. I think juicing them with your hands is the fastest and easiest way.</p>

			<p>dang it! the pics are such a tease that, when i ran across a huge bottle of POM at costco, i bought it. then made the frozen treats and hastily had a few friends over for a pomegranate frenzy. yeah, it&#8217;s pricey, but when you consider the cost of a few lattes at fourbucks&#8230;it&#8217;s totally worth the splurge. we feasted on frozen treats and jam&#8211;all made with POM and a few&#8211;three, to be exact&#8211;fresh pomegranates. thanks for the inspiration. next time i&#8217;m headed to istanbul i&#8217;ll be sure to time my trip with the apex pomegranate season.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve done a jelly w/o the seeds &#8212; gonna try your jam. thx.  Do you know the open-the-fruit-underwater technique? Fill deep bowl of warm water (so your hands don&#8217;t get cold.) Score the skin at the top. Plunge fruit underwater, rip apart and dig out the seeds. Seeds sink, the white stuff floats, easy to skim off. Plus any squirting happens underwater. No mess! And easy.</p>

			<p>I love pomegranates, as they are in season now in Spain I thought I would try. Just made a fig jam with anise seeds. I really like my jams to have a texture.<br />
Think I will try one plain one, one with a little hint of chili and the tunisian one looked good.<br />
Normally the jelly thing is a matter of time, with blueberries you normally add a bit of leafs as they have plenty of pectin.<br />
Will post back to tellyou how it went.</p>

			<p>I am definitely going to try this jam recipe and your ice-cream/sorbet recipies.. I am from South Africa and you rarely see pomegranates in the Fruit &amp; Veg shops and if you do they are also expensive.. I am very lucky to have my very own pom-tree in my yard. The tree is not that big but it sure yields a LOT of pomegranates. I searched the net for recipies and voila came upon your site!!</p>
