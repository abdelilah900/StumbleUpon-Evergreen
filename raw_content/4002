								<p>An Oreo Kiss, that is. So, if you have a chocolate lover on your hands, then try these tasty treats and their hands might just be all over you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bakerella/2261367115/" title="Oreo Kisses by Bakerella, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2171/2261367115_0ddd453742.jpg" width="425" height="280" alt="Oreo Kisses" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Oreo Kisses</span></p>
<p>1 package oreo cookies (divided… use cookie including the cream center)<br />1 8oz. package cream cheese (softened)<br />chocolate bark</p>
<p>1. Finely crush all but seven cookies in a food processor or place them in a ziploc bag and crush into a fine consistency. <br />2.  Stir in softened cream cheese. Use the back of a large spoon to help mash the two together.<br />3. Roll the mixture into 1&#8243; balls and place on wax paper covered cookie sheet.<br />4. Then, begin to form the shape of a kiss. Flattening the bottom and forming a point at the top. (Mine ended up about 1.5&#8243; tall) <br />5. It helps to put the uncoated balls in the freezer for a few minutes to keep the mixture from starting to fall apart when you drop into the melted chocolate.<br />6. Melt chocolate as directed on package and then dip &#8220;kisses&#8221; one at a time into chocolate, tap off extra and slide them off spoon onto wax paper covered cookie sheet to dry. <br />7. Once dry, refrigerate and enjoy! Oh yeah, just eat the extra seven cookies. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Decorate: </span><br />1. Handwrite your messages or create them on the computer. Cut out the strips (about 1/4&#8243; tall and however wide you need). <br />2. Cut up some square sheets of aluminum foil (about 5.5&#8243; square) <br />3. Place dry kiss in center and start wrapping the foil around the base. Insert message near top and secure it by pressing the foil together at top.</p>

				<p>ok, this is a very amateur-y question, but this is the funny part: I&#8217;M NOT AN AMATEUR!  i&#8217;ve tried to make oreo balls (and other things dipped in chocolate) like 45 times in my short life, and i don&#8217;t know how ANYONE does it.  i use candy melting chocolate.  i freeze the things to be dipped.  i&#8217;ve tried toothpicks, i&#8217;ve tried skewers, i&#8217;ve tried spons, etc, and every time, one of three things happen:</p>
<p>-the ball falls off the toothpick or falls apart<br />- it ALMOST falls off the toothpick, but after dipping, even if i tap off the excess, the chocolate pools EXCESSIVELY at the bottom (not just a few centimeters)<br />-one of the above 2 happens and i cry and sit under my desk and suck my thumb for 4 hours</p>
<p>can you help me?!  it would be MUCH appreciated.</p>
<p>love,</p>
<p>All Wrong in Austin<br />(Kelly)</p>

				<p>kelly &#8211; Don&#8217;t cry. Maybe this will help a little. I don&#8217;t use toothpicks and I use chocolate bark for the most part. I just drop the chilled ball (kiss) in a small bowl of melted chocolate one at a time. Then using a spoon, cover the top of the ball. Then I lift it out of the chocolate using the spoon. Next, tap it several times on the side of the bowl to allow excess to fall off the spoon. Then I let it slide off the spoon onto the wax paper. I also get some puddling sometimes, but I&#8217;ll just break that off when it dries if it is excessive. </p>
<p>Thanks a bunch clara!</p>

				<p>May I offer some suggestions. I am assuming that you are pretty new to this. I would work on how you list recipes as well as presentation. The food while cute, does not look as appetizing as it could. Keep trying and I am sure you will get the hang of it.</p>

				<p>I have another amateur-y question. Are you married?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because of the writer&#8217;s strike or because baseball season is still weeks away, but I find myself going back to your blog everyday anticipating the next creation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been holding out for a woman who can cook. Someone named Bakerella with an oven… you don&#8217;t have a big-screen do you? That would be the trifecta.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re desserts look amazing, but if you are ever in need a tastetester… I&#8217;m AVAILABLE.</p>

				<p>heya bakerella, is it meant to be a teeny sourish due to the cheese? and the chocolate that it&#8217;s coated with is a tad brittle right?</p>

				<p>Wow!!!!!! Thanks everyone for the really great comments! </p>
<p>kelly &#8211; I used the regular oreo package, not the double stuf. I went to the nabisco site. I think it&#8217;s the 18 oz. package that I used. (the whole package, minus about seven cookies.) I&#8217;ll count how many comes in the package next time.</p>
<p>megan &#8211; thanks for the tip.</p>
<p>hungry in hoboken – funny!</p>
<p>wyeinnazi &#8211; No, not sour…they&#8217;ll be sweet. And the chocolate does harden, but I wouldn&#8217;t call it brittle.</p>

				<p>Hi Bakerella, </p>
<p>I found you blog today by via NotMartha.com.  You ideas are brilliant and I cannot wait to make those little mini cupcakes on a stick!! I will be reading you blog now daily &#8212; yes, it&#8217;s that cool!</p>
<p>Your Ho! Ho! Ut Oh cupcakes made me want to share with you a treat I made last year (and this year) for Groundhog Day.  I use tootsie rolls for the groundhogs but I think using your candy-bark coated cake would be a better eating experience.  <a href="http://dozenflours.com/2007/02/groundhog-day-celebration-cupcakes_02.html" rel="nofollow">http://dozenflours.com/2007/02/groundhog-day-celebration-cupcakes_02.html</a>  (BTW I promise I picked this template a long, long time ago :-))</p>
<p>You rock!!<br />Julia</p>

				<p>I made these today for my girlfriend, and they came out to be pretty good! Except, I thought they were kinda a little sweet for me, but then again, I don&#8217;t have a high tolerance for sweets, and mine were a littleee bigger. And was it just mine or was the truffle filling really really oily? I didn&#8217;t use bark, but I used some Ghiradelli baking chocolate and it turned out okay. All in all, a pretty successful venture. Great recipe and idea, thanks!</p>

				<p>Bakerella,</p>
<p>I wanted to let you know that I made the dipped lollipops from your earlier posts.  I made it exactly like yours&#8230;red velvet w/pink coating.  The first several were tricky, but I certainly got it down to a science and they turned out beautifully.<br />I ened up with nearly 60 of them and my both my daughter&#8217;s classes are going to be thrilled when I bring them in for Valentine&#8217;s Day tomorrow!  My husband ate one and couldn&#8217;t get over how delicious and cute they were!  <br />Thank you for sharing your creativity and by doing so, making me feel pretty creative too!<br />P.S.  I found that freezing them in small groups on plastic plates allowed me to pull out 6-7 at a time.  I froze them for a few hours and they held up great in the warmed chocolate.  It also aided in the cooling/setting of the chocolate coating.<br />I am just tickled about them.  Can&#8217;t wait to try to oreo balls sometime soon!<br />I&#8217;m a BIG fan and thanks again!!!</p>

<p>Thanks for the camera info, you rock! I tried the kisses today however my hubby bought the mint double stuffed (he&#8217;s a little partial to those). So I had to work with it, here&#8217;s what I came up with.</p>
<p>38 pairs of oreo wafers<br />filling from 20 of the oreos/discard the rest<br />8 oz. cream cheese. </p>
<p>I then ground wafers, set aside<br />in a mixer mix cream cheese and filling to a smooth consistency, add wafer crumbs. </p>
<p>Shape and mold. I did one tray hand rolled and shaped and then I thought, hey maybe I could pipe these. Sure enough they worked GREAT piped and went a lot faster. By the time they were dipped I couldn&#8217;t even tell which were which (except that my hand-mades were a tad bigger. After they set with the regualr chocolate, I drizzled some melted ghiradelli mint chips on top and they look cute! All credit goes to you though, thanks for the great blog!</p>

				<p>adrienne &#8211; that sounds really great. I plan on making the mint ones soon and realized the ratios would be off, so thanks for the tip. </p>
<p>fyi &#8211; I&#8217;ve also seen off brand mint oreos that are the same size as the regular ones. But, so far I can&#8217;t find oreo brand mint ones that aren&#8217;t Double Stuf.</p>

				<p>hi bakerella,<br />i tried making kisses yesterday. Part 1 (which was mushing the cream cheese and oreos together) was successful ;). However part 2 is a different story altogether! I can&#8217;t get chocolate barks where I am so I naively substituted with baking chocolate. Wrong call huh&#8230;the choc won&#8217;t melt properly. Anyway after wasting one precious kisses, I decided to abort the project. So today I&#8217;m getting a pack of Hershey&#8217;s semi sweet choc chips and will try again. Any advise please? I have about 40 kisses sitting in the freezer waiting to be coated. :)</p>

				<p>I haven&#8217;t tried them with choc chips, so I don&#8217;t know if they are going to work out like you would want. </p>
<p>Can you get the candy melts/wafers/discs where you are. They are little round discs used for candy coating. That&#8217;s what I use if I don&#8217;t use the bark.</p>
<p>Wilton brand makes some. </p>
<p>But if the chips are all you have, go for it. Good Luck!</p>

				<p>hi bakerella, that was a quick reply, thanks! <br />I have not seen the products that you mentioned in stores here (I&#8217;m in KL), I guess I&#8217;ll have to keep my fingers crossed that the chop chips will work.<br />Thanks anyway, and keep up the fantastic work. You have no idea how inspired i am. :) If you ever teach a class and I can be there, I&#8217;ll be the 1st one to sign up ;) Cheers!</p>

				<p>dear bakerella, thanks to the link you sent I was able to find a local distributor for Wilton&#8217;s products. I was overjoyed ;) Got the candy melts BUT it didn&#8217;t work out. 1st batch that I melted in the microwave turned lumpy (i think i overheated it), 2nd batch I tried the double boiling method but it didn&#8217;t melt to the right consistency. It&#8217;s more to the &#8216;creamy&#8217; texture so I wasn&#8217;t able to dip the kisses properly. How do I achieve the choc fondue texture? Any recovery action that I can take? Thanks a lot!</p>

				<p>omaong &#8211; that&#8217;s great! Go back to the first method and retry. Just put in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time and stir in between until it is smooth and melted. The texture will probably be a creamy, not liquidy melted chocolate. You can put the kiss on a spoon and submerge in the chocolate, using the same spoon cover the top completely. Then take the spoon and lift the kiss out of the chocolate. Then you&#8217;ll want to tap it pretty good several times on the side of your bowl, so the excess falls off. Finally, let the kiss slide off the spoon so the flat side lands on the wax paper. (Tapping is the key)  Try not to get any pooling at the bottom. If you do, slide kiss across the wax paper, so when it dries, you can break off any thin remnant amounts of chocolate. I hope this helps some.</p>

				<p>Hi, I stumbled onto your site this week by looking for places to buy Nutter-Butters in bulk, and while here, discovered some yummy and cute things, including the Oreo Truffles.  My boss&#8217;s birthday is today, so I decided yesterday that I&#8217;d make them.  My son did my shopping and he didn&#8217;t get the white bark.  Instead he got Nestles&#8217; white morsels, and it didn&#8217;t work out right. I&#8217;m such a fumbler at coatings that usually I pipe them on, but didn&#8217;t try because of the lumps, etc., so I blobbed some on top, let it set just long enough to blob the tops of the rest, then turned each one over and blobbed the new top.  Because the bottom had spread, they almost looked like reversed oreos; if I&#8217;d been clever, I&#8217;d have flattened them before blobbing the second time, but in the middle of it all that didn&#8217;t occur to me.  They are a great hit despite not looking much like a truffle because of the things above, and what I just noticed that kelly said.  Before I try this again, I will fall back on something I KNOW will work for me: Dig out my candy molds and brush the coating into them, let it set up while I&#8217;m rolling the balls (making them small enough to fit inside), and then piping some more coating to cover them.  IF I want them on a stick (which is what I set out to do), I can stick them in either before or just after piping the final coating in.</p>

				<p>linsey-woolsey &#8211; I haven&#8217;t tried nestle morsels, but I can only imagine it was difficult to work with. You know now why the candy coating or bark works best. And, I think your idea of flattening them would have been great as reversed oreos. Very cute.</p>

				<p>Carla &#8211; you might be sticking them too far in. Only put it about the halfway point of the ball. Also, make sure the coating surrounds the ball at the base of the stick.</p>
<p>To thin chocolate, you can add a couple of drops of vegetable oil.</p>

<p>Stacey &#8211; you can definitely try it. You&#8217;ll have to experiment with the proportions, though.</p>

				<p>Hi Bakerella! I love your blog, your ideas are genious!</p>
<p>I have a few questions about the kisses; <br />1) Could I use regular chocolate cake mix? I ate out all the oreos&#8230; by accident of course. <br />2) Would it be possible to substitute the cream cheese with store bought frosting? <br />3) The most important question I have: how long can I keep these little things for? Would it be best to store them in the freezer or the fridge?</p>
<p>Thanks so much! I&#8217;ll definately be making a batch of these for my friends this Valentine&#8217;s Day. :) <br />Such a great idea!</p>

<p>SHARNA &#8211; blushing.</p>
<p>Anonymous &#8211; nope. it&#39;s chocolate or vanilla candy coating. </p>

				<p>I&#39;m considering making these &#8212; my girlfriend asked me out using a hershey kiss &#8212; but I don&#39;t want to make too many. What&#39;s the yield # of kisses on your 38 cookies:8oz cream cheese ratio?? Obviously halving would be pretty easy if necessary, or if it will only be a handful too many I can leave them out for family to devour.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for including these brilliant recipes with your delicious-looking concoctions!!</p>

				<p>Bakerella! You have such a cute site, I love all your creative recipes. For this one does regular hersheys chocolate bars work as a substitute for the chocolate bark? I just went to the market to get all the ingredients and really want to try it with hersheys&#8230; and maybe if I get it right this time i&#8217;ll try the &#8220;golden oreos&#8221;&#8230; also i love your red velvet cookie recipe. maybe show us how to make golden cakesters?? :) thanks!!!! &lt;3</p>

				<p>Hi Bakerella,</p>
<p>i have a question for you. I live in Europe and i have tried (well I did 2 years ago) making your brownie bites.  My problem is finding a chocolate equivalent.  I have not been able to find anything like chocolate bark, candy melts, candy coating, etc&#8230; nothing like this.  When I did the brownie bites before I just melted chocolate and butter&#8230;. but it hardened so quickly and it  took FOREVER&#8230; so any tips/idea would be so helpful, thanks!!!</p>

				<p>I just made the giant kisses tonight for our &#8220;Fun Friday&#8221; desert. With Valentine&#8217;s Day being a few days away, it was a perfect idea!! The kids were so impressed and loved them.  I love the recipie but my only complaint is I don&#8217;t know how to dip. It never looks smooth and proffesional. I usually use semi-sweet chocolat chips. Is that why?<br />
Tried the cake pops last Fun Friday&#8230;.. awsome!<br />
Love this website!!!</p>

				<p>I just made these today and to make the little happy valentines day paper coming out of the kiss&#8230;. i printed on white tissue paper. It looked identicle to the actually kisses! If anyone has any problems getting it through the printer&#8230; i taped the edges to a normal sheet of paper then just cut the messages out later! it worked out great!</p>
