<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/11/ganached-guinness-goodness/" title="chocolate stout cake"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/101/291485551_1c32467593.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="chocolate stout cake" /></a></p>
Because it&#8217;s fun for me, I&#8217;ve decided that today is the day that I will embarrass my former boss. You see, she and I are two of a very small group of girl-types in a very boy-dominated sector of publishing, and while I would normally argue that gender stereotypes are old, tiresome and played out, in our professional realm at least, they&#8217;re fairly rightly-placed. While the guys go on in great lengths about (pick one, or all of the below) the Red Sox, Giants, hockey, PlayStation, Borat, You The Man Now Dawg website, beer and where it doesn&#8217;t cost much and the Joy of Street Meat, she and I would spend an at least equal amount of time and devotion chattering about all aspects of food and cooking as, just my luck, she is as obsessed as I am. </p>
<p>Having excellent taste, she loves chocolate and Guinness in a near-equal ratio, thus when I happened upon <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/107105">this recipe</a> many, many months ago, I bookmarked it for the express purpose of making for her birthday. In the months since, she&#8217;s moved onto bigger better things &#8211; Full-time freelancing! Breaking even! Subverting the dominant paradigm! (fine, I added that) &#8211; this recipe has drilled such a hole in my bookmarks, I was unable to ignore it any longer, busting it out for the birthday of a friend who ended up stuck in the airport from LA and didn&#8217;t make back in time for Sunday night&#8217;s dinner party and a sampling of her cake, which as it turns out, we were more than capable of enjoying without her. [Is this sentence still on? Because, really, I feel no need to stop.]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/291485556/" title="chocolate stout cake"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/111/291485556_f6ad7753d0.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="chocolate stout cake" /></a></p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ve <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/10/and-then-i-went-shoe-shopping">explained before</a> that I&#8217;m not a huge fan of chocolate cakes as I think all that egg, flour and baking powder dilute the inherent charm of true chocolate, leaving you with things that taste &#8220;chocolatey&#8221; but are not that bite I crave, covet and occasionally dream about. But this cake is really fantastic. The beer gives it a richer, fuller, nuttier flavor while keeping it from leaning too heavily on the sweet side; the sour cream makes it an exceedingly moist cake that is neither mushy or unstructured, without requiring any additional basting, sealing or prayer to keep it on this side of the texture of stale cornbread; and the chocolate ganache on top with a hint of coffee is like the crowning third of the flavor trifecta. This cake kicks butt. </p>

<p><span id="more-79"></span></p>
<p>The original recipe, at least according to the numerous, amusing comments on Epicurious, makes a stunning amount of batter. I took several writers&#8217; advice and halved it to fit in a bundt pan, and decided to replace their sort of odd frosting suggestion with a basic, failure-free ganache, the same that I had used for the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/09/this-cake-has-a-hole-in-it">orange-chocolate chunk cake</a>. I reduced the recipe by one-quarter, remembering that it had made way too much, but even a 75 percent, it mostly puddled beneath the cooling rack, clearly begging for a swipe from our hungry fingers. </p>

<p><b>Chocolate Stout Cake</b><br />
Adapted from the Barrington Brewery in Great Barrington, MA via <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/107105">Bon Appetit</a></p>
<p>This recipe was originally intended to make a layer cake of 3 8-inch rounds. Upon many reviewers&#8217; suggestions, I halved it and it fit perfectly in a bundt pan. The halved amount is below, and the icing replaced with a simple ganache.</p>
<p>1 cup stout (such as Guinness)<br />
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter<br />
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch-process)<br />
2 cups all purpose flour<br />
2 cups sugar<br />
1 1/2  teaspoons baking soda<br />
3/4 teaspoon salt<br />
2 large eggs<br />
2/3 cup sour cream<br />
6 ounces good semisweet chocolate chips<br />
6 tablespoons heavy cream<br />
3/4 teaspoon instant coffee granules</p>
<p><u>Cake prep:</u><br />
Preheat oven to 350&#176;F. Butter or spray a bundt pan well; make sure you get in all of the nooks and crannies. (Some people even go so far as to brush the inside of their bundt pans with melted butter&#8211;you cannot be too careful!). Bring 1 cup stout and 1 cup butter to simmer in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add cocoa powder and whisk until mixture is smooth. Cool slightly. </p>
<p>Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in large bowl to blend. Using electric mixer, beat eggs and sour cream in another large bowl to blend. Add stout-chocolate mixture to egg mixture and beat just to combine. Add flour mixture and beat briefly on slow speed. Using rubber spatula, fold batter until completely combined. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Transfer cake to rack; cool completely in the pan, then turn cake out onto rack for drizzling ganache.* </p>
<p><u>Ganache: </u><br />
For the ganache, melt the chocolate, heavy cream, and coffee in the top of a double boiler over simmering water until smooth and warm, stirring occasionally. Drizzle over the top of cooled cake.</p>
<p>* Update 3/25/08: Previously, the instructions suggested that you cool the cake for only 10 minutes in the pan before flipping it out onto a cooling rack and cooling it the rest of the way. After several conversations with readers/test cooks who found that their cake stuck a little, awesome reader Susan tried to cool the cake completely in the pan before releasing it and nothing stuck. I agree that this might be a better way to go.</p>

				<p>This cake looks so yum! I&#8217;m adding it to about 6 other recipes that I&#8217;m dying to try, but have yet to find the time. Do you have any recipes for roasted red pepper soup? There are a million out there, but I&#8217;m sure you have a favorite. Also, if you say it&#8217;s good, it&#8217;s gotta be good!  Thanks</p>

				<p>You have the most amazing photographs on your site!!  I think I just drooled on my keyboard &#8211; but chocolate will do that.  I have to try this, the one time I made a chocolate cake recipe with stout as an ingredient it was ok, but not outstanding &#8211; this one looks great.</p>

				<p>LMB815 &#8211; Thank you.</p>
<p>Traci &#8211; Perhaps some lentil stew? Vegetable fritters? <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/10/unflinchingly-good-things" rel="nofollow">Squash with lime vinaigrette?</a> </p>
<p>Jessie &#8211; I just saw this collection of North African recipes on Food and Wine and immediately bookmarked half of them, so I know what you mean about the queue!</p>
<p>Suzette &#8211; I haven&#8217;t made roasted pepper soup, but I made a fresh red pepper soup last year that became a party favorite. It&#8217;s PERFECT. Recipe over <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/21/dining/211frex.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>
<p>Joanna &#8211; I hope you like this one better &#8211; the stout makes it deliciously bittersweet.</p>
<p>Tammi &#8211; Hooray! I love it when I end up testing out recipes people want to make, as much as I love it when others do the same for me. I think you&#8217;ll like this cake.</p>
<p>Ashley &#8211; Fresh Direct, for the third time now, has sent me white chocolate pastilles when I ordered 61% ones. They credit their mistake, but I&#8217;m still stuck with them, so I&#8217;ve taken to using them for decorations.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb-</p>
<p>The cake looks incredible&#8230;I was an avid reader of your blog on ivillage and absolutely love your new smitten kitchen blog. </p>
<p>I was the person who asked about your opinion on Ina Garten last week. I also have a slight obsession with her. I find nothing more relaxing than watching her show, listening to her (somewhat endearing) slight insecurities of Jeffrey finding another woman to cook for him and hearing her say &#8220;Now, how easy was THAT?&#8221;. I made her pecan squares and they were excellent- but definitely put a sheet of foil on a lower rack in your oven. I learned that lessons that hard way. I didn&#8217;t dip the ends in chocolate, as she suggests because &#8220;Why not? Ha.Ha.Ha.&#8221;. I figured that the 9 sticks of butter used in the recipe were enough in terms of indulgence. My co-workers loved them though and I think it would be a great dessert to bring to a Thanksgiving dinner party.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you still have the link to the oreo cookie recipe you had posted on ivillage? I can&#8217;t seem to find it on your new site. </p>

				<p>Oh MY! If I had known I might have gotten a piece of this cake, I might have postponed subverting the dominant paradigm for a few months! I think I&#8217;m going to have to bake one of these and bring it to the office (so the remaining folks can help me avoid eating all of it myself).</p>

				<p>I was making this cake (the 3-layer version) the night of the NYC blackout &#8212; luckily, i was in Boston and not New York, but I&#8217;ve never wished for a cake to cook faster in my life, for fear that the darkness might spread up our way. And, insult to injury, I decided not to serve it at my sweetie&#8217;s 30th bday the next day because the ganache was all lumpy and crumb-y (user error &#8212; too impatient to wait for the layers to cool!). But we somehow managed to dispatch of it pretty well in the weeks following! Only had to give a few chunks away to friends and strangers on the street (for self-preservation, of course).</p>

				<p>Jocelyn &#8211; Will you be in town? If so, put some lip gloss on, we need a party.</p>
<p>Michelle &#8211; I crack up about her relationship with her husband too, all Jeffrey-this and Jeffrey-that. Jeffrey, who is by the way, not exactly a nobody himself. Alas, those NINE STICKS OF BUTTER (how does she do that? I didn&#8217;t even know that amount was possible!) are what&#8217;s kept me from making those pecan bars, though I would also never cut them as large as she did &#8211; portion control! &#8211; or dip them in chocolate (somewhere, Alex is taking issue with this). I grabbed the Oreo recipe over <a href="http://nosheteria.com/2006/04/and-who-doesnt-love-sandwich-cookie.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Nikki &#8211; I was wondering the same myself and while I am certain it would be, the only factor to be considered is if it will easily come off a paper wrapper, and I haven&#8217;t tested that yet. My bread-baking teacher, also a pastry professor, by the way, who was, we joked, obsessed with Pam spray, said whether it sticks should be a non-issue, if you are worried, just spritz the papers lightly with Pam before you put the batter in. I haven&#8217;t tried this yet, but I have no doubt he knows what he&#8217;s talking about. Simply buttering the pans would work fine too, if you want a paper-free experience. </p>
<p>Kate &#8211; I will regret saying this, no doubt, but I&#8217;m not minding the daily thing either. Oddly, the most annoying day to post was not a busy weekday but Saturday, when I was too busy with other things to sit down for a while. I wonder how long I can keep it up!</p>
<p>Kirs &#8211; You&#8217;re welcome!</p>
<p>Peabody -Thank you.</p>
<p>MJF &#8211; Ha. Ha. Remaining folks, indeed. Just me and the tumbleweeds some days, it seems. That said, the boys loved the cake and would certainly be happy for more.</p>
<p>Ella &#8211; Prayer sometimes works. I actually have a non-stick bundt, which gives it a slippery start, but after many failed attempts at greasing it (I always miss some crevice), I just use Pam now. Still, this cake lost a chunk! but instead of panicking, I released the missing chunk as carefully as I could while the cake was still hot, and managed to pat it back into it&#8217;s exactly place so it merged a bit while it cooled. You couldn&#8217;t tell at all. (Of course, the ganache helped cover it, but really &#8211; slow and steady, it will come back together).</p>
<p>Alanna &#8211; Why trade? Besides, you&#8217;ll need some green salad and carrot sticks after a hunk of this!</p>
<p>Shuna &#8211; That&#8217;s beautiful. Yet another reason to expat myself!</p>
<p>Cupcakes &#8211; Yeah, no joke. I don&#8217;t buy the bulk of stuff there (not that our stores are much better), but it&#8217;s great when having a big party and the prospect of carrying ten bags home and up four flights of stairs seems not worth it at all. Great price on those Guittard baking pastilles, though, only $5/pound! Also? Those artichokes at $1.99 were cheaper than anywhere around here by DOLLARS. </p>
<p>woodwinkedithink &#8211; I don&#8217;t have conversions up on this site yet &#8211; another item for the endless site to-do list! &#8211;  but Clotilde does on Chocolate &#038; Zucchini. Link is <a href="http://chocolateandzucchini.com/archives/2006/09/conversions_equivalents.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>
<p>Jess &#8211; What a story! I only wish I had been closer, and not stuck on a roof with some frat boys drinking out the contents of their beer fridges.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t have a nonstick bundt pan but mine come out everytime. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how:<br />
Use a pastry brush and brush on softened butter or shortening.  It&#8217;s best to have a dark pan because you can see exactly where you missed. Be liberal with your brushing and go all the way up the sides and middle cone.  </p>
<p>Then dust once with flour over a larger tupperware or something like that. Once you&#8217;ve tapped out all the flour you&#8217;ll be able to see the holes you missed and go over them with the pastry brush again. Repeat the flour dusting.</p>
<p>TAHDAH! No more stuck bundts! Patience is the key &#8211; but if you enjoy baking you&#8217;ve already got plenty of that. </p>
<p>I made this one recently: <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/262/750/1600/pumpkincake.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/262/750/1600/pumpkincake.jpg</a></p>

				<p>I made this cake last night to take to Thanksgiving dinner and it is really incredible, the best chocolate cake I&#8217;ve ever had.  I&#8217;m thinking about refraining from guiling the lily too much and dressing it with powdered sugar only.  Thanks for posting about it!  Unfortunately (or fortunately?) I failed to heed your warning about the amount of batter and ended up making two cakes!  My guests this weekend will be the lucky beneficiaries.  : )</p>

				<p>Oh! I&#8217;ve had this cake &#8211; a really super baker chick made it for my boyfriend&#8217;s birthday (she was married to his best friend, so that was ok with me), and I decided to try making it myself and it ended up lighting on fire in the oven. Yes. On fire. In my electric oven. Durh. I will try your version, because I can DO bundt. Bundts are my friend. Ever done the Harvey Wallbanger cake? Super easy but not as fancy like all your gorgeous recipes &#8211; a pkg of yellow cake mix, a pkg of vanilla pudding mix, 4 eggs, however much oil the cake mix calls for, 1/4 c vodka, 1/4 c OJ, 1/4 c galliano, bake in a bundt at 350 for 45 mins, and you have squishy soft citrussy goodness. I bake it for my hot Irish neighbor, but I think he&#8217;s going to get a Guiness cake this time!! Thanks for a great site!</p>

				<p>I made this two days ago; it is crazy good and has an incredibly moist, satisfying crumb.  I spread my ganache all over it as it never &#8216;drizzles&#8217; for me so beautifully (as in Deb&#8217;s picture).  A MUST make.  Easy and amazing.  I looked for Guinness but ended up using Young&#8217;s Double Chocolate Stout.  Crazy.  Good.</p>

				<p>I love this cake&#8230;in fact, I&#8217;d be hard pressed to try another chocolate cake right now.  I can&#8217;t believe how moist it stays&#8230;even days later.  Unbelieveable.  And the best part?  Taste testing beers that pass muster.  Guiness is a little weak in flavor and the Young&#8217;s Double Chocolate Stout is&#8230;ICK!  I ended up using a hearty microbrew&#8230;Rogue&#8217;s Chocolate Stout.  It was delicious.  </p>
<p>Your photo is positively inspired.  Is that sliced almonds as a garnish?</p>

				<p>I made this recipe into cupcakes &#8211; I got 16 cupcakes out of it. Baked them at 350 for about 18 minutes.  They didn&#8217;t really dome up too much &#8211; they are sort of flat, but very light &#8211; so I think they raised as much as they were going to.</p>
<p>Used all the ganache on them &#8211; worked really well and was much less fiddly than frosting cupcakes usually is.    I agree with JennyL and Traca &#8211; even in cupcake form, this cake is staying wonderfully moist. I was inteding to post a picture on my blog &#8211; but they all got eaten before I thought to take a snap!</p>

				<p>Just made this cake with the last pint of Guinness left over from our St Patty&#8217;s Day revels.  And it&#8217;s delicious!</p>
<p>I did want to mention, however, that my cake took a full 50 minutes to bake.  Maybe our oven temps are different or maybe because I used my fancy Nordicware bundt pan that looks like cathedral arches, but at 35 minutes my cake was still mostly batter.  The extra bake time did the trick, though.  What a moist, yummy cake.  Definitely one that will make it into regular rotation at our house.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m delurking to say that this cake has officially set my role in family gatherings.  I brought it to a family dinner and now I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m allowed to show up to anything ever again without it or I might be disowned.   Two things about my baking experience, one is I used non-dutch process cocoa because it&#8217;s what I had and it was fine,  and second I used bittersweet chocolate for the frosting, also because it&#8217;s what I had in the pantry.  The bittersweet ganache was fantastic, I&#8217;ll do it again that way.  Paired with a good vanilla ice cream the sweetness wasn&#8217;t overpowering and the complex chocolate flavors really came through. yummy!  Also, flour those bundt pans!  I didn&#8217;t the first time and my trash can was the recipient of my hard work.  I floured the @&amp;%* out of it the next time and it slipped out and was still beautiful.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m a big beer geek and I made this recipe two nights ago with a considerably darker and more aggressive stout &#8211; Victory Storm King Imperial Stout.   The results were excellent &#8211; so much dark rich flavor and only 3/4 cup of cocoa!</p>

				<p>Seriously? Maybe the most delicious cake I have ever made. I made it for my husband&#8217;s birthday. He LOVES Guinness, chocolate and cherries. In order to make it cover all of those bases I added a cup of unsweetened, dried cherries while getting the butter and stout to simmer. Then I skimmed them out and added them to the ganache for a little sweet pop. My cake took 60 minutes before the tester came clean (I have an old gas stove). I greased my pan thoroughly with Pam and didn&#8217;t have any problems getting it out of my no-stick bunt pan. Thank you for the wonderful recipe! I&#8217;ll not only use this one over and over again, but I will be back for more!</p>

				<p>I made this last night, the first &#8220;from scratch&#8221; cake I&#8217;ve ever made.  It was AMAZING.  My mother said it was the best chocolate cake she&#8217;s ever tasted.  I loved that the flavor was so chocolate-y, but not in a sweet way.  Just really rich and delicious.  I had a bit of cake stick to the bundt pan, but I just stuck the pieces back in and covered it with the ganache.  Next time I&#8217;ll be a little more ruthless in my spraying.  I&#8217;ll definitely be making this again &#8211; THANK YOU!</p>

				<p>After the obligatory wait in the queue, I made this cake yesterday when I had some friends over, and they all raved (of course!).  Alas, I also had a problem getting it out of the pan in one piece &#8211; I am a putz and it ended up falling all apart.  BUT!  I saved the cake &#8211; I just broke it up intentionally and put it in a casserole dish and then drizzled it with the ganache.  It still looked pretty, and duh, it tastes the same.  Oh and mine also took about 45-50 minutes.  Worth every second of the wait!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve had this book marked for months and just made it for a party full of doctoral candidates and professors. It won RAVES and is my new go-to party/chocolate emergency cake. Can I ask, what are the white chocolate dots in the picture? Are they melted? Can you tell me so I can replicate them? They look divine. Thanks!</p>

				<p>Hi&#8230; this is a belated comment, but I am about the make this cake tonight. I am looking at your recipe and it says 6 tbsp sour cream. The original recipe called for 1 1/3 cup. 1 1/3 cup = 16 tbsp + (5 tbsp + 1 tsp) ~ 21 tbsp, right? Then in half that would be just over 10 tbsp. Maybe I&#8217;m making a really dumb mistake on the math &#8211; let me know!! Besides, I&#8217;m sure it would come out great either way</p>

				<p>Hi Rachel &#8212; The original recipe was intended to yield 3 8-inch layers. I halved it to make one bundt cake. 1 cup = 16 tablespoons, so 2/3 of a cup would be 10 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon and ohmygod you are absolutely right, the recipe is shorted a few tablespoons of sour cream! Evidently, from the reviewers comments above, this made little difference in the final product (can we say &#8220;phew!&#8221;),including mine, however it would be more accurate to use 10 tablespoons (I think we can safely leave off that teaspoon, eh?). I will update the recipe accordingly. Thanks for the sharp eye!</p>

				<p>I love this recipe x 1,000,000 &#8211; I found it on Epicurious back in early May, when I decided to bake cupcakes for my boyfriend&#8217;s birthday. The flavor of the cake is so much more complex than regular chocolate cake. In other words, I agree completely with your excellent assessment. </p>
<p>Unlike all the smart people, though, I made the whole recipe. Which produced 49 cupcakes. FORTY-NINE CUPCAKES. Almost all of which I filled with chocolate ganache (again, you are a smart person &#8211; I add coffee to almost every chocolate recipe and should have added it to that ganache) and topped with Bailey&#8217;s buttercream frosting. Irish Carbomb Cupcakes, minus the whiskey. Happy Birthday, baby, indeed. </p>
<p>(And finally, I love your writing and photography!)</p>

				<p>This sounds absolutely delicious.  I&#8217;m going to have to try it.  I have a question for you.  My husband loves Guinness and he has a birthday coming in December.  He emailed me a picture of a mug full of guinness beer shaped cake.  Does this make sense?  Anyway I want to make the cake for him but I truly have no idea where to even begin.  It needs to be tall and it looks like fondant was used but I&#8217;ve never used fondant.  I need a delicious cake that will stand up to whatever I&#8217;m going to put it through to make it look like a mug of guinness beer.  Any thoughts?</p>

				<p>Deb, I made this cake, not once, but twice (!) this past weekend for 2 different birthday celebrations.  It was so unbelievably good, it instantly made itself a place in my permanent file.  Thank you so much for your wonderful website, I love every inch of it, and have been completely spoiled by your daily postings for Naplahblahblah (I may have to check my spelling on that).</p>

				<p>OK!  I&#8217;ve had this one printed out for awhile, but finally had an excuse to make it for a family gathering this weekend.  I haven&#8217;t *tasted* it yet (officially, that is&#8211;unofficially, I had nibbles throughout the process), but it looks and smells fantastic.  Utterly fantastic.  I&#8217;ve got it in a cake-carrier now for transporting to Chicago tomorrow and I keep unlatching and lifting the lid to take a whiff.  It is delicious.</p>
<p>Thanks for (what appears to be) another winner, Deb!!!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,<br />
I just made this recipe for our super bowl party, and it was fabulous! Thanks so much for converting the recipe and recommending the ganache. Also, this is hands down, the best cake batter I&#8217;ve ever eaten from the bowl!</p>

				<p>Just found your site the other day and am amazed at the amount of recipes that you and I have both tried. Hubby loves this cake but it is true that when followed to the letter it makes on HUGE (but delicious) cake. Since so many people have liked the baking with booze, here is a great recipe from epicurious that is equally chocolaty and is already in cupcake form! <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/108594" rel="nofollow">http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/108594</a></p>

				<p>This was so good. The ganache topping was amazing!!! A co-worker is leaving here after a few years and going back to Ireland and she loves Guinness so when I found came across this site looking for Guinness recipes, I thought it would be perfect for her going away party. Of course, since I don&#8217;t bake often i had to test it first so I made it this week (the party is next week) and brought it in for some other co-workers. Everyone loved it!<br />
The only thing i ran into was after 30 minutes in the oven, it was still moving batter so i left it in for another 20, but I think I should have taken it 5 minutes earlier than I did. Thank you so much. I will be checking back here for great recipes, already pulled off a cookie recipe I must try.</p>

				<p>This recipe has reached Portugal!<br />
I made this cake yesterday, and it was a huge success!!! Not a single crumb was left :-)<br />
Today I tried it again, but used fresh orange juice instead of the beer. It comes out as moist as the first one, different taste off course, but with this sweet aroma!&#8230;<br />
Great recipe!!!<br />

				<p>I can&#8217;t wait to try this recipe.  Does anybody know why is there only one birthday for person in a year?  what a fool limitation&#8230;  ;-)  I think I&#8217;m going to start a new tradition in non-birthday celebrations or something.  As you imagine, I can only bake for a &#8220;big reason&#8221; as a birthday or similar but I have so many recipes to try&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, sorry for my english and thank your very much for this recipe, Anamado told be about it and I think it&#8217;s going to be a great succes when I finally bake it (hope sooner than later).</p>

				<p>I do NOT like chocolate cake, but this cake was delicious!!! However, I did not care for the ganache, as it was too chocolatey for my taste. The next time I make it, maybe I will do a white choclate cream cheese frosting. This cake gets my two thumbs up (says a lot from a non-chocolate cake eater!!) Thanks for the recipe.</p>

				<p>Oh yeah, I ran into the same problem as Crystal&#8230;30 minutes was not long enough, it was wiggly jiggly in the center. I left it in prob another 10-15 and it was perfect. I had a problem getting it out neatly from the pan also, but I think I tried to do it before it cooled enough. I&#8217;m making it for a thank you gift for my neighbors tomorrow. Thanks again for the recipe!!</p>

				<p>This cake has become a staple in my baking repertoire since I discovered it last year. It was how I first came to love and trust your blog. I recently tried some twists on the cake, like baking it in two round pans and using mascarpone frosting. But the twist I must share was discovered last night, St. Patrick&#8217;s Day. I made the cake bundt style and when preparing the ganache, I replaced 3 Tbps of heavy cream with a nip of Irish Cream. I also added some Irish Cream tinted whipped cream on the side to cut the chocolate intensity. It was a smash success!</p>

				<p>UPDATE..<br />
I made this last night for a small get together. It was even better than the first time! I let it cool completely and it came out of the bundt pan great (last time it did not) I baked for 45 min, it came out perfect and moist. As I said before I am not a huge chocolate fan so I did not care for the ganache, so this time I made a white chocolate cream cheese frosting. I cheated for time&#8217;s sake&#8230;I used about 3/4 container of a pre-made cream cheese frosting and about 1/2 bag of white chocolate chips. I melted the 2 together in a double boiler. Once it was smooth and hot, I poured it over the guiness chocolate yumminess and it cooled hard(not sure if that&#8217;s the right adjective..not hard like a rock), not runny. It was insanely good, I was complimented left and right for it!!! YEAH! Thanks again for an incredible recipe&#8230;.</p>

				<p>I have a great story behind the first time I made this cake:  My current boyfriend drinks good quality beer and so does his roommates. I made this cake thinking it would be a great &#8220;nice to meet you&#8221; gift to the 2 other fellows he lives with. That was a year ago, and I&#8217;m still getting requests to make this cake! It&#8217;s perfect, however I need to bake it a little longer with the 2/3 c. sour cream rather than the 6 tbsp. recipe.</p>
<p>Thanks for the great cake recipe!</p>

				<p>I made this cake last night for a party.  I made it with 2 cups whole wheat flour.  I used Lindt Choolate bar for top.  I used half bitter and half semi.  I also used a little bit more chocolate.   I topped the entire cake with crushed walnuts.   Everyone loved the cake.  Especially me who does not like chocolate cake.<br />
The only thing I did not like was I could taste the carbornation of the beer.  Not sure how to get rid of that.  Should I use less or simmer it a little bit more?</p>

				<p>oh my. i don&#8217;t have a bundt pan, so i used this same quantity and made two cake rounds with it. chocolate ganache and strawberries on top (and in between the layers, of course), drove everyone at our dinner party nuts! so moist, so delicious.</p>

				<p>This is by far the best cake I&#8217;ve ever made&#8230; and completely gorgeous with the ganache and a few shaved chocolate curls on top. My three-year-old daughter *liberally* buttered the bundt pan for me, and the cake slid right out after cooling. It was all so easy to make, I could hardly believe how perfect the texture and taste turned out. I&#8217;ll definitely be making this again!</p>

				<p>They are white chocolate discs for baking from Guittard. At the time, Fresh Direct kept sending me the wrong chocolate (white when I ordered dark) so I had a collection of them. As soon as you drape the ganache, while it is still warm, you can put the white chocolate pieces in and they&#8217;ll meld with the dark chocolate to become smooth.</p>

				<p>Hi Jeannette &#8212; There are a billion reason why a cake can sink&#8211;too much leavening, not enough flour, your baking soda could have expired, it could have been underbaked, you were at a higher altitude, something could have been measured wrong&#8211;as you can see, the possibilities are almost endless, and I can&#8217;t be sure of what happened in your kitchen. That said, I have had great success with this cake when made as directed above. Perhaps you&#8217;ll have better luck next time.</p>

I&#8217;ve been drooling over your site for a while now (your pictures are fabulous) and this is the first thing that I&#8217;ve actually made. It didn&#8217;t live to see the next day, and there were only four of us eating it. I&#8217;ve got another one in the oven right now actually that I&#8217;m bringing to a luncheon.

thanks for this recipe &#8211; it&#8217;s awesome. i was looking at your recent pumpkin pie recipe with only vague interest as i&#8217;m not much of a pumpkin pie person and i spied this, which you had made 2 years ago on that day. what luck! i just made it and it&#8217;s amazingly good. i used st peter cream stout and we drank the rest of the bottle with the cake. yum. oh, and we ate the cake with il laboratorio malt gelato on the side. it was still warm, so didn&#8217;t do the ganache thing. will ice the rest with the ganache in the morning!</p>

				<p>oh, also, i don&#8217;t have a bunt pan so used a normal 9&#8243; cake pan and it took a while to cook &#8211; an hour exactly.</p>

				<p>This is a fantastic recipe. I made it last night, but used a mini-bundt pan instead of a full size. It took 20 minutes on the dot, and the little cakes are fantastic &#8211; perfect single servings. I used powdered sugar instead of ganache. It&#8217;s great for the flavor, though I imagine the ganache would moisten things up a bit. </p>
<p>Thanks so much! I&#8217;m sending people this recipe all over the place.</p>

				<p>I made this cake for my family at Christmas and it was a huge hit- so much so that my stepdaughter asked me to make it again this week for her birthday cake!</p>
<p>I used Shakespeare stout, which cost about $6 PER BOTTLE!!!! but Hubs says is the best thing ever. I tasted a spoonful while measuring it into the batter and made such a face that he and my FIL about died laughing&#8230; but then stout&#8217;s never been my thing. Sure was great in the cake, though.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ll be trying this cake!  Reminds me of great chocolate cake recipe from Judy Rosenberg&#8217;s &#8220;All-butter Fresh Cream Sugar-packed Baking Book&#8221; (one of those cook books you want to make every recipe) that uses coffee and sourcream.  Another good &#8212; and EASY &#8212; chocolate cake is Wacky Cake: old recipe from Depression Era that doen&#8217;t use eggs but is really moist and chocolatey.</p>

				<p>Yes, yes&#8230; this is one AMAZING cake! It is my most requested chocolate cake, and my personal favorite chocolate cake. I&#8217;ve made the full batter version which produces three cake layers and calls for whisking the ganache (I actually whip it).  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never used all of the layers in one cake, though.  I split each of the three cakes horizontally to make six layers, which I make into two three-layer cakes or one four-layer cake and then a &#8220;half cake&#8221; of the remaining layers. I make one full recipe of the whipped ganache recipe for each of the “two” cakes. Any leftover ganache is warmed up again (making it darker in color) and then drizzled down the sides of the chilled cake. It makes a fabulous presentation! If there’s still more ganache left you can pour it over ice cream, or find some other use for it – never, never let chocolate go to waste!!</p>
<p>BTW&#8230; If it happens to be that I don&#8217;t actually need two cakes I will still do the splitting of the cakes and freeze the unused cakes (unfrosted) to be used another time.  The frozen cakes, when eventually used, are still moist and delicious. If freezing the cakes, I recommend double-wrapping each layer individually.</p>

				<p>Wonderful!  This is so dang easy and quick, I can&#8217;t believe it.  Such amazing flavor, and texture.  I will TRY-TRY-TRY to wait until it cools in the pan next time&#8230;.I took it out too early and it crumbled.  OMG&#8230;.it was so good I couldn&#8217;t wait.  :)  Thank you very much for sharing great and easy recipes!!!</p>

A while back I ran across a Chocolate Sout recipe and found many many others as well.  I&#8217;ve tried 3 other Chocolate Stout recipes and this one is by far -THE-  best one!!!  (This is coming from me and various others who have tried this one after i made it the first time and I&#8217;ve since made it many many times!)  </p>

				<p>Just made this tonight for my knitting group (group theme is hardcore knitting plus dessert).  Wow. Wow. Wow.  It came out really well even at altitude, and plopped perfectly out of the bundt pan onto the plate which I&#8217;d buttered massively; everyone loved it.  I skipped the ganache because I&#8217;m lazy, and whipped the heavy cream to have on the side.  </p>
<p>PS &#8211; I think this counts as my three-year-old daughter&#8217;s first beer.</p>

				<p>I made this for my husband (really for myself and didn&#8217;t tell him) for Valentine&#8217;s Day this past weekend. It is so good, I find myself trying to swipe a piece of it even early in the morning before breakfast like yesterday and today. Just don&#8217;t tell. This is such a simple, delightful and fantastic recipe. I love it! Oh yes, so did my husband!</p>

				<p>A couple of my friends got together this weekend for dinner and I made this cake using Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. Good god, this cake is amazing- so moist and rich, with excellent chocolate flavor. I added a bunch of those white chocolate disks to the top (they are so pretty!). They ended up melting a bit because I added them before the chocolate ganache, but it actually created a pretty swirly effect at the top, and it tasted really delicious with the rich cake.<br />
Thank you Deb!!</p>

				<p>This is one of the best cakes I have ever made. I sort of improvised for the ganache and added some bourbon to make it more like the Irish car bomb cupcakes elsewhere on your site. I served it with vanilla ice cream. It was a fantastic birthday cake for my husband, thanks so much for the recipe!</p>

				<p>i made this recipe as cupcakes last night for a scrabble party.  i filled the cupcakes with the chocolate ganache (using the cut-out-a-cone method) and frosted them with a salted caramel buttercream frosting.</p>

				<p>I just made this cake today for my little brother&#8217;s 21st birthday. It worked out perfectly since we also decided to celebrate St. Paddy&#8217;s Day again, complete with corned beef, cabbage, mashed potatoes, and Guinness for drinking. This cake made an AMAZING ending to the meal. Thank you so much for the pictures, ganache and for halving the recipe. I followed it exactly as directed, and it was, for lack of a better word, perfect. I hate chocolate cakes that are too sweet; the rich chocolatey flavor of this cake is THE best. Thank you so much.</p>

				<p>This is my new favorite chocolate cake &#8230;and I&#8217;m not even that big of a chocolate fan! For the ganache, I used a mixture of semisweet chips and some creme de menthe chips I had left over in my cupboard &#8212; delicious! I didn&#8217;t have time to let it cool completely, but didn&#8217;t have too much problem removing it from the pan. Thanks!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb :) I just saw this recope at Jen&#8217;s &#8216;use real butter&#8217; website and would love to try it, but I am wondering whether if there is anything I could substitute for the stout? I know that&#8217;s a dumb question since the stout is the other important element of the cake aside from the chocolate, but I do not drink alcohol but I love a plain (no whipped cream, powdered sugar or ganache) chocolatey chocolate cake. I was thinking maybe using coffee instead of stout but I am worried that it will effect the texture of the cake. I was thinking the coffee will not evaporate as much as I am guessing the alcohol in the stout does when in the oven and if I sub in coffee i will get a soggier cake. I am tempted just to buy stout to use in this cake since everybody says this cake is so yummy! &#8211; but any suggestions for a substitute would be helpful. Thanks so much for sharing all you recipes and cooking experiences!</p>

				<p>I came across your blog a couple months ago, and I really enjoy it. This cake is not the first recipe of yours I&#8217;ve made, but this is my first comment. My husband recently discovered that today is his 10K day- he is 10,000 days old today. He wanted me to make him a cake he had never had before to celebrate, so I immediately starting searching your blog. I knew this cake was perfect because I had a Rogue mocha porter in the fridge that I just hadn&#8217;t been in the mood for lately. We whipped up the cake, and upon tasting the first finger-full of batter I knew it would be marvelous! It&#8217;s in the ove</p>

				<p>I made this for a friends birthday- it was a hit!  The combo of chocolate with the guiness is just right.  And the ganache is what makes this cake stand out.  To help keep my cake from sticking to the pan, I got out a pastry brush and buttered every inch of the thing, but it was definitely worth the effort.</p>

				<p>I made this cake last night and it was delicious. The prep was pretty easy too, but I did run into a couple problems. There was so much batter that I thought it was going to overflow in the oven, but fortunately it didn&#8217;t, although it came close. Despite brushing the entire pan with melted butter and waiting for the cake to cool completely before removing from the pan, I still had a problem with sticking. For the most part it was fine, but the tops of the decorative humps stuck, leaving the cake flat instead of with a pretty bundt top. I also apparently stink at drizzling. My drizzled ganache looked quite messy, so I ended up spreading it all over the cake like frosting. Then I made little stars of white icing in a circle like you did with the white chocolate. It ended up very pretty. Also, it took much longer in the oven than stated in the recipe, about 45-50 minutes (my oven doesn&#8217;t usually take extra long). But it came out perfectly. Very moist, rich, and chocolaty. I even noticed that my picky, dainty-eater friend finished her huge piece.</p>

				<p>There&#8217;s basically a small window in between the time ganache is too thin (just runs down and puddles) and too thick (must be spread). You can practice with a few spoonfuls to see if yours is ready yet as it cools. A cool cake can help combat a too-runny ganache, re-warming it <em>slightly</em> can help a ganache that doesn&#8217;t want to drip at all.</p>

				<p>I originally made this cake using the Epicurious layer cake recipe, which made way too much batter for me to work with. I decided to try this recipe as cupcakes so it could be shared at work more easily, and it turned out wonderfully! I just cooked the medium sized cupcakes for 20 minutes, rather than the 35 minutes suggested for the Bundt pan. They turned out just as moist, rich, and delicious as the cake, only in individual sized servings (&#8230;it was hard to eat just one, though).</p>

				<p>just made this one.  my bake time was around 50 minutes as others mentioned.  i also used the butter and flour method to prep the bundt pan, and it worked great.  it slid out of the pan with amazing ease.  i didn&#8217;t use guiness, and instead used a dark ale called black toad, which has a really nutty flavor.  next time ill let the ganache get a little more hot, because my ganache drip doesnt look as nice as yours!  great recipe!</p>

				<p>I just made this cake this morning and left it to cool for several hours. I only had He*she*s Cocoa and light sour cream. Also, my stout was Guinness Extra Stout. I baked it in a stoneware bundt pan which I liberally buttered and then dusted with cocoa (I don&#8217;t like the whiteness flour leaves on a chocolate cake). All but the very crest of the crown released perfectly from the pan. The tiny part that didn&#8217;t come out can quite easily be filled in with ganache or frosting, I have yet to decide for sure which way I will go. It is certainly a beautiful cake and very easy to make. And the crest part I sampled? Gracious goodness! Thanks for another keeper for the rotation!</p>

				<p>I just made this cake for my dad&#8217;s b-day.  Of course, in my rush to get it done before he went to bed, I didn&#8217;t read past the recipe to see just how much batter was made so I ended up making 2, 2 layer cakes!  It&#8217;s a LOT of cake, but I think he liked having a choice since I decorated them differently.  Thanks for the suggestion!  It&#8217;s a real hit for a chocolate lover!</p>

				<p>Just made this in honor of National Bundt Cake (Pan) Day!  About 50 minute baking time and waited for the cake to cool before flipping it- I didn&#8217;t have any problems getting it out in one piece.  Question:  My ganache turned out kind of grainy-looking, not pretty and shiny.  And it didn&#8217;t pour very well.   I didn&#8217;t make any substitutions and used good chocolate&#8230;thoughts?</p>

				<p>I just wanted to pipe in and say that I use a silicon bundt pan and this cakes cooks in 35 minutes and doesn&#8217;t stick at all (I still butter the pan) the silicone pan can feel a little unwieldy but it works great and in a tiny kitchen like mine a big ornate pan you can smush and fold to fit in a drawer is a real windfall.</p>
<p>Also I&#8217;ve used the Bailey&#8217;s frosting from your Chocolate Whiskey and Beer cupcakes and I love it for a contrast. It looks pretty too.</p>

				<p>Have recently made this cake for my father and father-in-law&#8217;s birthdays, but in traditional round cake form (it yielded 3 nine inch rounds). I used 2 of the rounds as a layered cake with the chocolate ganache as both filling and cover. The 3rd round made for an elegant single layer cake, using the rest of the same batch of ganache. I still had much more ganache leftover than I needed and &#8211; aside from all the ecstatic praise this cake received &#8211; the one issue was its heaviness. This is a deliriously decadent cake, which serves better as a bundt than a traditional (double layer) cake. The single layer was much more manageable&#8230; one could consume more than an 1/8th inch sliver!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m so glad to stumble on this in your archives &#8211; this is my FAVORITE cake ever, but I&#8217;ve always been too scared to halve it (fearing to mess with such a good thing). Whenever I make it I fill up three 6&#8243; rounds, all my cupcake tins, and usually some other random pan. I will say this, it freezes beautifully.  But it is dangerous to have cake that is THAT good lurking in your freezer &#8211; it never lasts long.  So glad to know that it CAN be done!  If anyone could do it &#8211; you can!</p>

				<p>OK, I made this over the holidays, for people who insisted on the original icing.  It was probably the best chocolate cake ever, except that it was a bit dry the next day.  The solution to that, of course, is to feed it to enough people so that it doesn&#8217;t have to wait around!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to try it again, now we&#8217;re back in Scotland (and can get Guinness NOT brewed in Canada!).  I&#8217;ll go for the ganache, because it sounds so much better.  And I&#8217;ll make it one morning before work, and they&#8217;ll simply gobble it down, I&#8217;m sure. :)</p>

				<p>For the &#8220;ganache&#8221;  &#8211; I prefer just to put some semi-sweet chocolate, or unsweetened chocolate in a double boiler &#8211; and simply add Bailey&#8217;s or Khalua until the consistency becomes smooth. Then simply drizzle that over the top. It also hardens a bit and give a nice texture. The Bailey&#8217;s/Khalua is a nice touch to compliment the Guinness. Enjoy!</p>

				<p>unbelievable!</p>
<p>Like many other readers, I have to preface the review by saying that I am NOT a chocolate cake fan. But this, this was out of this world. I loved the texture of the crumb &#8211; so rich and moist and sinful. </p>
<p>I followed the recipe exactly for this one addition:</p>
<p>Highly recommend &#8211; add rum (or beer) soaked raisins to the batter. They elevate this cake to a truly sublime level. </p>
<p>I soaked a cup of raisins in rum overnight. They become so soft and plump that they almost dissolve in the baked cake; but what they add is beyond magic. </p>
<p>My only gripe with the cake is the ganache: the 6 tablespoons of cream were not enough for me to dissolve the chocolate. But that was easily fixed by adding a couple of tablespoons more. What I do suggest, however, is a different method to add coffee flavor. This cake is so good, that it deserves real, not instant, coffee. Crush whole coffee beans, preferably mocha java, and soak them for 30 minutes in 1/3 cup scalded heavy cream. Drain the cream through a cheese cloth. Add the rest of the cream, bring to a boil; poor the cream over the finely chopped chocolate (oh, by the way, use good chocolate, not cheap chocolate chips); whisk vigorously, until chocolate is compeletely melted. </p>
<p>Thank you for this recipe. Definitely a keeper!</p>

				<p>Forgot to add:</p>
<p>I brushed the mold with melted butter; let the cake cool in it completely; had no problem getting it out &#8211; slid right out after about 3 hours.<br />
After 35 minutes of baking it was nowhere near done; took about 50 minutes to bake through, while remaining perfectly moist.<br />
I used Belgian double chocolate stout &#8211; worked fine. (Would have used regular Guinness, but they only sold it in 6-packs, and there are no stout drinkers in the household at present).</p>

				<p>This is the best freakin&#8217; cake on earth. The original Epicurious recipe makes a ridonculous amount of batter &#8211; enough for 48 cupcakes. I love this cake! I usually halve the recipe too, and fill two 6&#8243; round cake pans (lined with parchment) about 2/3 full, with some extra batter left over for several jumbo cupcakes.</p>

				<p>I used Guinness Extra Stout and the cake turned out beautifully.  I hate dry cakes, and am not big on oily ones, but this one was the perfect moistness.  It was a hit at the party to which I took it!  (Seriously, it&#8217;s a perfect 21st birthday cake.)</p>
<p>(Hint for college students who don&#8217;t have a double broiler: the ganache can be made in the microwave.  Start with 30 secs, then stir, and go on until it&#8217;s perfect.  Drizzling works best when it&#8217;s still HOT.)</p>

				<p>Hey Deb,</p>
<p>I discovered your website not too long ago, courtesy of a girlfriend who served some AMAZING food at a party and gave you all the credit. I&#8217;ve already made several recipes, and both my boyfriend and myself are big fans.</p>
<p>I made this recipe last weekend using a chocolate stout. I ended up using 3 times the amount of sour cream called for (I was making the Chocolate-chip sour cream cake at the same time and mixed them up&#8211;oops!) and it still turned out amazing. I&#8217;m looking forward to making it correctly.</p>
<p>As a law student, I&#8217;m stressed out a lot of the time, and your website has provided some much needed cooking relaxation, so THANKS!</p>

				<p>I made this cake for my birthday party last night and it is quite possibly the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted!  It was a huge hit at the party and I couldn&#8217;t resist but have a piece for breakfast this morning.  I think it tasted even better the next day!  Thanks so much for yet another wonderful recipe.  I will be making this cake often.</p>

				<p>I also made this cake for my birthday and I want to thank you for posting it because WOW!!! I&#8217;m a dark chocolate fiend, and I can say without a doubt that this is *the best* chocolate cake I&#8217;ve ever had (even tho I&#8217;m a lousy baker). If you like deep, dark chocolate flavors then this is the cake for you!!! My 5yo has asked that I make *this* cake for his next birthday. I didn&#8217;t make the ganache for my cake, I used homemade whipped cream instead. Perfection! I can&#8217;t wait to try making it with different stouts and different frostings. </p>
<p>NB: I was so glad to have read the comments too, my cake took longer to bake, 50mins vs. the 35mins in the recipe (gas oven, super low elevation). Also, my little trick &#8212; via America&#8217;s Test Kitchen &#8212; for greasing the pan is 1 Tbs melted butter + 1 Tbs Dutch Processed cocoa powder (we use Hershey&#8217;s Special Dark), blend into a paste then use a pastry brush to brush onto the pan, making sure to coat every nook and cranny. Perfect release and a nice crust on the cake.</p>
<p>There are so many great food blogs, I hadn&#8217;t gotten around to checking this one yet but now it&#8217;ll be part of the rotation, thank you!</p>

				<p>I made this for my husbands birthday, he is a real beer geek, so I thought it would be a fun surprise&#8230; and it is really great! I used Brooklyn Brewery Chocolate Stout. Very chocolatey and dense. My kids (ages 4 and 6) would not try it because they have never seen a Bundt cake before, and they didn&#8217;t like the shape&#8230;.haha, more fore the grown ups!</p>

				<p>This cake is devious!  I&#8217;ve baked it twice.  Once in bread pans (baking time &gt; 35 min.) and this past weekend in mini cupcake silicon baking liner (baking time 20 min.).</p>
<p>Thanks for the delicious (and easy) alternative to my usual cake-in-a-box.</p>

				<p>Yum!  I made it in a springform pan, then instead of the ganache I topped it with the Bailey&#8217;s frosting from your &#8220;beer and whiskey&#8221; cupcakes to look like the foam on top of a pint of Guiness.  Really good and very easy cake.  Surprisingly good chocolate flavor for a cocoa powder cake.</p>

				<p>I made this cake last night to bring to work today for St. Patrick&#8217;s Day/ a co-worker&#8217;s birthday.  I used Guinness and baked it in two 9-inch round pans and put a green butter cream frosting in between the two layers.  I still used the ganache on the top and sides- it really spread well and completely covered the cake.  Then I made a giant 4-leaf clover out of more of the green butter cream to decorate the top.  It was quite festive.  It took about 35 minutes to bake in two layers, and I am located at sea level.  The cake was delicious.  It was very moist, and I thought the low-sweetness of the ganache contrasted very nicely.</p>

				<p>I don&#8217;t know from beer (what is stout, exactly?) so I just used a can of Guinness draught that I found in my son&#8217;s room (he&#8217;s legal)   I don&#8217;t know that this is &#8216;the best chocolate cake I&#8217;ve ever eaten in my life&#8217;, but it was darn good.   Mine took 45 minutes in the bundt pan and I didn&#8217;t heed the cool completely warning and so lost the top on turning it out. Residual heat did help it heal itself nicely.  I didn&#8217;t frost the cake either, just left it plain and served it topped it with ice cream and drizzled some of your hot fudge sauce over it  Everyone was happy.   The piece I tried plain, had a sort of malty finish..very nice.   A nice compact, moist crumb, too.</p>

				<p>Didn&#8217;t frost it and it was just what I wanted&#8230;the kind of cake you cut a chunk from and eat out of hand while mozy-ing about.  Just right for me. Really moist &#8211; lasts for days. Not too chocolately and not too sweet. My new everyday go-to chocolate cake. Thanks for another winner!!!</p>

				<p>I found this via one of the many backlinks on a recent post&#8230; and can&#8217;t resist saying that I have loved this recipe from Epicurious for many, many years.  I don&#8217;t know anyone who doesn&#8217;t adore this cake after trying it&#8211;even those to whom I have talked it up ad nauseum beforehand, and who frankly expected that it could NOT possibly be as good as I claimed!</p>
<p>I use Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout, which I thought you might like to try next time since you&#8217;re from NYC.  (Right?)  I think it&#8217;s only out at Christmastime, so I buy enough to drink fresh AND horde in the fridge for this recipe.  (Yes, seriously.)  And I make a plain ganache for the top of mine, too.  One additional thing:  If you make the full recipe and do the 8in layers, it DOES make enough batter for those layers plus 4-6 cupcakes.  I highly suggest not cutting back on the recipe just so you can have some instant gratification for all of your hard baking work in the form of cupcakes that nobody else needs to know about.  Yum.</p>

				<p>I made this last night in an angel food cake pan, and it was fantastic! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe, so i&#8217;m referring them to your site, of course. :) Do you think I could use Bailey&#8217;s instead of heavy cream for the ganache? I thought it might make it a bit more &#8216;irish car bomb-ish&#8217;. Thoughts?</p>

				<p>I just made this tonight&#8230;.since I don&#8217;t have a bundt pan, i made it in two regular pans (one round and one square). I also improvised on the ganache: instead of a straight-up ganache, i used the leftover sauce from this: <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/04/lime-yogurt-cake-with-blackberry-sauce/" rel="nofollow">http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/04/lime-yogurt-cake-with-blackberry-sauce/</a> to make a blackberry ganache.

				<p>I found Smitten Kitchen while I was confined to bedrest due to a difficult pregnancy last summer. Can I say you were God sent?  I couldn&#8217;t cook, which I love to do so I looked forward to what you would create next.<br />
I made these as cupcakes tonight with baileys frosting from one of your other cupcake recipes.  My Dad and Mom are here visting the grandkids and no word of a lie, as soon as I put the cupcakes on the cooling rack my dad was trying to eat one.  He had to wait a couple more minutes, but said they were &#8220;excellent&#8221;.  As a non-chocolate person and a very harsh critic of my own cooking, I have to say the same.  So, thank you for entertaining and inspiring your followers.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made this cake a few times and I love how chocolatey it is!  I&#8217;m making it for a friend&#8217;s wedding this weekend&#8230; as her chocolate option.  I&#8217;m planning on doubling the recipe and using a hotel pan size (20&#8243;x 16&#8243;).  I&#8217;m going to line the pan with parchment paper so it doesn&#8217;t stick, but I&#8217;m a little concerned with the cake cooking all the way through in the middle, since I&#8217;m using such a large pan.  Any suggestions?<br />
Thanks for the delicious recipes!!  You rule!</p>

				<p>I made this cake the other day and it was TO.DIE.FOR. My mother-in-law even complemented me. For thank, my most sincere thanks. However, one question</p>
<p>What size pan did you use, the 6 cup or 12? My cake appeared much flatter. It doesn&#8217;t look as filled out as yours does.</p>

				<p>I just finished piping a batch of cupcakes that I made using this recipe, and they&#8217;re absolutely delicious. Absolutely&#8230;delicious. I used Young&#8217;s Double Chocolate Stout, eschewed the ganache and went straight for a Irish Cream buttercream. I&#8217;ve seen a whipped version floating around, but I used the butter/Irish Cream/powdered sugar variety. 2 sticks of butter (whipped for a few minutes), add 4 tbsp. Irish Cream, powdered sugar until desired consistency (Ehh, 6-ish cups or so), mixed on low speed. Phenomenal. Thank you :)</p>

				<p>Did this for the crew at work and it was enthusiastically received!  I had naturally processed cocoa in the pantry so I used that (now that the hot chocolate season is over) and half-n-half for the heavy cream.  I took the license of titling it &#8220;Stout Boy&#8221; and that, along with a cartoon image of a roly-poly kid, garnered chuckles among the partakers!  I&#8217;ve got to get a new bundt pan, mine is one of those crazy-detailed castle molds (or whatever it is supped to be); even with the &#8220;brush melted butter&#8221; technique there was some sticking in the intricate mold.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s better to use softened but not melted butter to grease bundt pans. I believe I read this in one of Rose Levy Beranbaum&#8217;s cookbooks, but I don&#8217;t have my copies here right now. (The best way to grease them is with that spray stuff, but that&#8217;s not an options for my soy-allergic house. -_-)</p>

It does stick tho!  I tried two different ways oil spray and crisco rub and it still stuck.  But that doesn&#8217;t make any difference because dump on the ganache and no one will ever know!!!  I blogged about it and put a link to your blog for the recipe!  So goood!  Thanks for this post!  Oh and all the party guests thank you as well!</p>

				<p>We were really disappointed with this cake. Someone said in the reviews from Bon Appetit that it was ever better than the recipe on the back of the Hershey&#8217;s Cocoa box (don&#8217;t knock it until you try it!), and that&#8217;s why I decided to stray. I used Baileys for the cream in the ganache, and that improved it a little. It was okay, but just not what we were hoping for. Though I&#8217;m happy that all of the other commenters enjoyed it :)</p>

				<p>My boyfriend and I just made this cake and we LOVED it.  We used his homebrewed chocolate stout and it was just great.  It&#8217;s not an overly sweet cake, which is why we both decided that it tastes so good.  We are definitely going to make this again.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s in the oven right now, (still at 45 minutes) I&#8217;m wondering if the fact that I had a silicone bunt pan, and I had to put in on a baking sheet for the first 30 minutes (till it was solid enough to move without the pan folding in half!) is why it&#8217;s taking so darn long. I also didn&#8217;t use a hand mixer because something happened to mine and it started SMOKING when i plugged it in!! And it still mixed well.</p>
<p>My mom is the sour cream coffee cake extrodinare and she ALWAYS allows hers to cool COMPLETELY before removing, then she places a plate upside down on top of the bundt pan with her right hand while holding the cake underneath in her left and flips it very fast onto the plate in her right! Works like a charm. She also flours her pan in addition to butter.. Do you think that flouring the pan for this would be better?</p>

I am a recent reader and have read from present day back until June 2008 so far &#8211; I don&#8217;t close the window so it&#8217;s always there for me to read and I don&#8217;t lose my place!

				<p>This cake lives on! I made it last night for my boyfriend&#8217;s birthday. Looks amazing with the drizzled chocolate. I dusted it with some powdered sugar for some extra fun. I&#8217;d like to second (or third&#8230; or tenth) the extra cooking time. Mine took 55 minutes at 350 in a gas oven and an ancient bundt pan (probably 50 years old, enamel coated?). Thank you for the blog, I truly love it and am a devoted reader for as long as it lives!</p>

				<p>Last year my birthday was kind of a sad time. My mother had an unfortunate brain injury that has now left her about mentally and physically handicapped. I was so sad that I couldn&#8217;t go home and visit for my birthday and I couldn&#8217;t have my mother around to make me feel special. I know it gave her great joy to see her children grow up and to be there for every birthday. When my birthday came around last year I was dreading knowing that it wouldn&#8217;t feel the same.</p>
<p>My girlfriend surprised me with this cake. I am not a huge fan of typical birthday cakes but I do love beer. This cake was absolutely incredible and I could not stop sneaking a few extra pieces! My birthday is this weekend and she is using this same recipe again. I cannot wait! She uses a creme brulee chocolate stout for the beer and it is TO DIE FOR! Thank you for this recipe because it is now a special part of my birthday and it helps me to remember that my birthday is still special even without her here or having her speak the words &#8220;Happy Birthday.&#8221;</p>

				<p>i just baked those into  muffins, and this stuff is just amazing.<br />
such an unbelievably intensely deep chocolate flavor..</p>
<p>i need to distribute those asap so that i don&#8217;t end up eating them all haha.</p>
<p>* some minor changes i had to make : (1) no sourcream so used plain full-fat yoghurt (2) the german malt i used seemed a bit pale so i just used 2 cups and simmered longer till it was reduced to what looked like 1 cup (3) i mixed the cocoa in the egg/yoghurt mix because simmering the beer took so long</p>

				<p>Hi. I&#8217;ve been baking chocolate Guinness cakes in various sizes and guises of late since its so damn moist, complex and goood. The idea of a bundt cake makes me fancy giving your take a whirl, especially as this flavour combo&#8217;s biggest fan is an 11year-old: mature tastes maybe, but still young enough to be excited by anything with a hole in! Plus, it does look smashing :) so ill happily break out the extra strength Guinness once again IF I can clear up one query: I&#8217;m a brit, and my fluted pan isn&#8217;t helpful as regards its volume. Would its 25cm diameter (10&#8243;) equate to 12 cups? Heeelp, please!</p>

				<p>Intro: Love your blog, Deb!  I&#8217;ve recruited several other friends to become followers of SK by making dishes for them from your archives and telling them you are, in fact, my favorite food blogger.<br />
GGG comment: I just made this cake last night for a friend&#8217;s birthday and it was INCREDIBLE.  So moist, delicious and *easy* to make.  It is immediately going into heavy rotation in our house.  We didn&#8217;t have sour cream on hand, so I substituted greek yogurt &#8211; no one knew. Left the cake to cool completely before removing from pan &#8211; no problem (brushed the pan with melted butter prebaking).  If people want to flour the pan for extra insurance, I suggest using cocoa powder instead &#8211; works the same, but tastier and prettier.  I have half a can of Guinness left and I&#8217;m going to make cupcakes with the same recipe tonight.  Thank you for all the deliciousness you have added to our table!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;d like to bake this as a mini layer cake &#8211; two 5&#8243;x2&#8243; layers. I think the volume will work out if I halve your halved recipe. Any suggestion for baking time? Thanks!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made the three layer version a few times for friends&#8217; birthdays and was looking for a similar, smaller cake my young daughter and I could make for my husband&#8217;s birthday.  Thanks for developing this &#8212; can&#8217;t wait to try it with the ganache!  Glad to see it adapts well to cupcakes, too.</p>

				<p>I am obsessed with this site, regularly checking it when i cannot think of what to make for dinner, or even what to bake on a lazy afternoon&#8230; i believe my recent 2kg weight gain is likely to blame on smitten kitchen!!!<br />
however i am finally compelled to write a wee note on this recipe as im excited as pie (ha, pun) to bake this for my boyfriend&#8217;s birthday tommorow as i will be using his personal home brewed stout which he made the other week, just to give it that extra kick! so thank you for the inspiration and thank you in advance for my delicious cake!!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb. made the guinness cake today and must confess it was the first recipe in two years that was not an unqualified success.  All seemed well until it came out of the oven. (added a pinch of espresso powder to the batter, just couldn&#8217;t help myself)  waited for the cake to completely cool, inverted it over a cooling rack and waited patiently for the cake to drop.  half and hour later 1/3 of the cake dropped.  Took a deep breath flipped the pan back over and gave it another 30.  the remainder finally dropped down in about 4 chunks.  I made a double dose of ganache and cemented the cake back together with it.  It is now sitting in the freezer waiting for Xmas.  I am hoping that by dessert time everyone will be too distracted by it&#8217;s chocolatey decadence to notice the shape it&#8217;s in.  I&#8217;m not a baking rube I promised I used a non stick bundt pan and coated it with copious amounts of butter.   That sucker now weighs about 6 pounds.</p>

				<p>I just made this for my boyfriend&#8217;s birthday &#8211; he loves Guinness and I love chocolate. What a DELICIOUS cake! So moist and a wonderful chocolate flavor. I *ahem* am one of those people who brushes melted butter in bundt pans, and I had no trouble at all with the cake sticking. It came out looking like Martha Stewart had baked it.</p>
<p>The only changes I made were to add 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the flour mixture and serve with freshly made whipped cream, in addition to the chocolate ganache. I really liked the cinnamon in this. It didn&#8217;t detract from the chocolate, but added a little something extra.</p>
<p>Thanks for the wonderful recipe!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made this many times and I can never get it out of the pan.  I have a nonstick Bundt &#8211; this time I brushed with melted butter.  I have done Pam, non melted butter, butter and flour, all to no avail.  Is it possible that a different Bundt pan would work better?  Maybe my nonstick has lost it nostickiness?</p>

				<p>Hi Smitten Kitchen!  I love your recipes and I LOVE this cake.  We made it a few times and it was always delish, so I decided to make it into cupcakes for our annual Christmas Eve party (sometimes people are reticent to cut into a cake, so we thought cupcakes might be more inviting).  Anyway, the only thing I modified with making this into cupcakes was I only baked for 20 minutes and they were perfect.  I think any longer and they would have been overdone.  Instead of covering the whole top with the ganache, I put a beautiful and healthy dollop of the ganache on top of the cupcakes.  They were a hit!  Thanks for all the wonderful recipes and photos!</p>

				<p>I discovered your blog about 6 months ago and I LOVE it! This cake was delicious- I made it exactly as your recipe said, and while it took 50 minutes to cook, as many have said, it was perfect when it was done. I&#8217;ve not gotten the hang of ganache yet- mine was a bit thick and didn&#8217;t drizzle beautifully, but no one cared for sure. I&#8217;ll be making this again soon!</p>

				<p>Made this cake this weekend and seriously people, MAKE THIS CAKE!!!  I am not usually a huge fan of chocolate cake however I am a convert.  I used Rogue Double Chocolate Stout, which I enjoy much more than Guinness and I think it made the cake even better!  I have never been steered wrong with any of your recipes and you&#8217;re the first place I go to when I&#8217;m looking to bake/cook anything.</p>

				<p>I didn&#8217;t have a Bundt pan so I used two 8-inch round pans that were almost 2 inches tall. I put exactly 2 cups of the batter in each one and then used the remaining batter to make 11 perfect sized regular cupcakes. </p>
<p>Put the cakes in and after 15 minutes, put the cupcakes in and they both cooked perfectly for 35 and 20 minutes, respectively.</p>
<p>However, my cakes would not come out after I cooled them for ten minutes. I had brushed butter in the nonstick pans but not used parchment paper or floured them. Next time I will &#8220;flour&#8221; them with cocoa powder after greasing them. Awesome to make when you do need cupcakes b/c making the ganache and dipping the cupcake top straight into it is a lot quicker than traditional frosting method.</p>
<p>Love it!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb. I LOVE this cake. I make it for everyone. I love it so much and I am sure there is a way to make it into a cookie for a valentine&#8217;s day gift. I am not sure actually, which is why I&#8217;m requesting your help! Is there any way to make this a successful cookie? And would there be a good alternative to the ganache? Thank you thank you!</p>

				<p>I also doubled the recipe and used a 9 inch cake pan and a loaf pan. The 9 inch cake needed a lot more time (as a few others noted but I failed to notice until too late). I cooked the big cake for just over 50 minutes and got paranoid that i was burning it so I took it out. It sank in the middle and could probably have used another 10 minutes. The loaf pan one came out lovely after 35 minutes.</p>

				<p>I was thrilled to find triple-hedonism in this cake, made for the chocolate loving birthday gal of a joint birthday party duo (I&#8217;ll comment on your NY cheesecake recipe about the other one).<br />
I also reversed it back into the original recipe&#8217;s proportions- it doubled like a dream, making 3 9-inch layers &amp; 1 rectangle for snacking (maybe 8&#215;11?).<br />
Because apparently 4 sticks of butter, a bottle plus of beer, &amp; espresso ganache are NOT enough, I used the recipe off the bag of powdered sugar for chocolate icing &amp; my friend made a coffee bean/chocolate bark for decoration.<br />
Over-the-top? Yes!  Much-loved by all &amp; your recipe appreciate by the baker? Yes.  Thank you!</p>

				<p>I made this last night for Valentine&#8217;s Day.  I made it into 24 cupcakes and they baked in 18 minutes at 350F.</p>
<p>I stuck to the recipe like glue except that I spiced it up ala the Spiced Up Brownie also on Smitten Kitchen.  I added 3/4 teaspoon chipotle powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon cardamom.  I then did a simple cream cheese frosting that I piped on top.  Amazing!!  Very moist cake and the spices really added something to it.  I will make again, but probably halve it as 24 cupcakes is a lot for us.  I actually prefer it without the cream cheese frosting myself but my husband loves the frosting.</p>

				<p>So, as suggested, I greased THE CRAP out of the bunt pan, but the damn cake still stuck and came out in a delicious, moist pile.  I almost had a little meltdown, but I had an idea&#8230;  and so &#8220;Chocolate Stout Mistake Cake&#8221; was born.  To save this cake, I whipped up a batch of cream cheese frosting, mixed it with the cake pile, smooshed the mixture into a spring-form pan, chilled, and topped with the ganache.  It looked like a fancy torte, and tasted very yummy.</p>

				<p>Love the cake! I just made this for the third or fourth time in the past year. I use a stoneware bundt pan and it always takes 50-55 minutes for mine to cook through in my convection oven. I got overzealous this time and turned out the cake before it was completely cool. I lost one little &#8220;curve&#8221; at the bottom, but I can fix it and easily hide it. I&#8217;ll be smothering it in ganache tonight. Looking forward to celebrating with this beauty tomorrow!</p>

				<p>I made this cake for a friend&#8217;s St. Patrick&#8217;s Day party (which also involved a whole keg of guinness, and guinness stew). It came out really well, and everyone liked it.<br />
The only thing I would do differently next time is use less instant coffee powder in the chocolate. I used the Starbucks kind (Via Columbia) and maybe it&#8217;s stronger than regular instant coffee, because I thought the coffee flavor overpowered the chocolate. Not that it kept anyone from eating it, of course :)</p>

				<p>Our household is dairy-free, so I modified this using soy yogurt in place of the sour cream.  I also used coconut milk in place of the heavy cream in the ganache.  Both turned out great.</p>
