<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/12/grasshopper-brownies/" title="grasshopper squares"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3120/3121533320_342e72aa0d.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="grasshopper squares" /></a></p>
My grandmother was a pretty fly lady, though I am not sure anyone called her &#8220;fly&#8221; in her lifetime. She loved anything glamorous and I&#8217;m pretty sure she saw the point of doing a whole lot in moderation. She&#8217;d send my sister and I (beware, frightening New Jersey-in-the-80s references ahead) glittery and puff-painted jaw clips and manes from the flea markets in Florida, she never discouraged the splattered and acid-washed jeans and neon slouch socks I wish someone would have formed an intervention over (shudder) and I specifically remember her finding me a pair of silver moccasins that in my mind <i>couldn&#8217;t have been any cooler</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3121537382/" title="melted chocolate"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3221/3121537382_391987037e.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="melted chocolate" /></a></p>
<p>So, it should come as no surprise that when she made brownies, she didn&#8217;t just make any old brownies. Instead, they were three layer affairs; one chocolate, one mint and then a chocolate topping and she didn&#8217;t just stop there. Nope, Grandma took an <a href="http://www.tootsie.com/products.php?pid=105">Andes Candy</a>, divided it in half on the diagonal, and sank it like a shark fin into that chocolate and her &#8220;creme de menthe brownies&#8221; were possibly the most glamorous thing I had ever seen and my favorite brownie to eat.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3120696885/" title="mmm, eau de freshly baked brownie"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3106/3120696885_1e396ee4a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="mmm, eau de freshly baked brownie" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-1524"></span></p>
<p>I unearthed the recipe a few years ago &#8212; a thin brownie not heavy on the chocolate (which came from a can of <a href="http://www.hersheys.com/syrup/home.asp">Hersheys syrup</a>!), a quick butter/powdered sugar buttercream flavored with creme de menthe and a melted chocolate chip topping &#8212; and I am so ashamed to say this, but they just didn&#8217;t live up to the memory I had of them. I knew I could make tweak the recipe to make them better somehow, but it just seemed wrong.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3120693387/" title="brownie batter"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3119/3120693387_5b3905af1e_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="brownie batter" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3120691597/" title="light brown sugar"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3221/3120691597_0d7b8c2f28_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="light brown sugar" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3121525126/" title="in ye go!"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3093/3121525126_5d9c614516_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="in ye go!" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3121526744/" title="puddle o'mint white chocolate ganache"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3288/3121526744_682a8c8c74_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="puddle o'mint white chocolate ganache" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3120704361/" title="didn't lick the bowl, nope, not me"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3105/3120704361_c6254b77f4_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="didn't lick the bowl" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3120709589/" title="grasshopper squares"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3243/3120709589_fbdd054c51_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="grasshopper squares" /></a></p>
<p>But these&#8230; they&#8217;re richer. The chocolate flavor is more intense. They&#8217;re a bit neater and more compact and I would never call them &#8220;better&#8221;, I&#8217;ll just say that this is the way I had always remembered the others tasting. I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d complain one bit if I handed her one of these instead of her version; she&#8217;d enjoy them thoroughly. And then she&#8217;d tell me to stand up straight, and perhaps wear some colors once in a while.</p>

<p><b>Lady, you&#8217;re killing us with the sweets:</b> I know, I know. We&#8217;ve been desserts overboard this month, but I can&#8217;t let you all go into the biggest baking weekend of the year without one last totally gorgeous and indulgent confection. A fantastic dinner party dish is coming next (I mean, I hope it is as delicious as the last time I made it!) and then some moderation. Perhaps in the new year. How else will we find cause for resolutions?</p>
<p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/12/austrian-raspberry-shortbread/">Austrian Raspberry Shortbread</a> Surely, you still have time to make these, yes? I hope you do.<br />
<b>Two years ago:</b> <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/12/chocolate-concise/">Robert Linxe&#8217;s Chocolate Tart</a>
<p><b>Grasshopper Squares</b> [aka Creme de Menthe Brownies]<br />
Adapted from <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/holidays/christmas/christmascookieschocolatemintgrasshoppers/recipes/food/views/GRASSHOPPER-SQUARES-233300">Gourmet, December 2005</a></p>
<p>I have one gripe with these squares: The ganaches are too soft. I honestly don&#8217;t know why they require so much cream as they never really firm up, even in the freezer. It makes for a delicious bite but not a whole lot of stackability or transportability. What I would do next time is try to make the ganaches with half the cream and see if they firm up better &#8212; they should. If you feel comfortable doing so (you&#8217;ll want to chocolate <I>with</i> the cream, rather than pour it over) I have a feeling it will be a nicer consistency. But even if you use the full amounts, you won&#8217;t be disappointed in the taste.</p>
<p>Final note: With white chocolate, the quality is especially important. The original recipe&#8217;s comments on Epicurious are filled with complaint from people who used Ghirdelli and other white &#8220;chocolates&#8221; (filled with artificial ingredients) which split easily once heated and never came back together. This has happened to me before when I used Ghiradelli. Although pricier, both Valrhona and Callebaut make exceptional white chocolates; I used the latter.</p>
<p>Makes anywhere from 72 normal-sized brownies to 117 one-inch squares (I think the perfect size)</p>
<p><u>For brownie layer</u><br />
1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) unsalted butter<br />
10 1/2 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not extra-bitter or unsweetened and no more than 60% cacao if marked), finely chopped<br />
1 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar<br />
3 large eggs, lightly beaten<br />
1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla<br />
3/4 cup all-purpose flour<br />
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder<br />
3/4 teaspoon salt</p>
<p><u>For mint ganache</u><br />
1/2 cup heavy cream (see recipe notes)<br />
10 oz fine-quality white chocolate, chopped (see recipe notes)<br />
2 tablespoons green cr&#232;me de menthe (I skipped this and found the mint flavor strong enough; compensated for the tinting with a single drop of green color)<br />
1 teaspoon peppermint extract</p>
<p><u>For chocolate ganache</u><br />
1 cup heavy cream (see recipe notes)<br />
10 oz fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), finely chopped</p>
<p><u>Make brownie layer:</u><br />
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375&#176;F. Lightly butter a 13- by 9-inch baking pan and line with 2 crisscrossed sheets of foil, leaving a 2 inch overhang on all sides. Butter foil.</p>
<p>Melt butter and chocolate with brown sugar in a 3-quart heavy saucepan over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Remove from heat. Whisk in eggs and vanilla until combined. Whisk in flour, cocoa, and salt until just combined.</p>
<p>Spread batter evenly in baking pan and bake until set and a wooden pick inserted in center comes out with moist crumbs adhering, about 20 minutes. Cool completely in pan on a rack, about 1 1/2 hours.</p>
<p><u>Make mint ganache:</u><br />
Bring cream to a simmer in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan and remove from heat. Pour over white chocolate in a bowl. Let stand 1 minute, then whisk until smooth. Stir in cr&#232;me de menthe and extract and chill, covered, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 1 hour.</p>
<p><u>Make chocolate ganache:</u><br />
Bring cream to a simmer in a 2- to 3-quart saucepan and remove from heat. Pour over bittersweet chocolate in a bowl. Let stand 1 minute, then whisk until smooth. Chill, covered, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p><u>Assemble layers:</u><br />
Spread mint ganache over top of cooled brownie in a thin even layer using offset spatula, then chill until firm but still slightly sticky, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Spread chocolate ganache over mint and chill until firm, about 2 hours.</p>
<p>Lift dessert out of pan using foil overhang. Run a heavy knife under hot water and wipe dry, then trim edges of dessert (1/4 inch off each side). Cut dessert into squares and peel from foil.</p>

				<p>I have an original recipe of this brownie in a cookbook from the little neighborhood school my kids attended.  Yes..Hershey&#8217;s syrup and all.  I was not impressed then and since the advent of the artisian chocolates, I would be less so, now.  Your recipe looks much better.  Thanks, Deb.<br />
PS..I made the Rainbow or seven layer bars and your parmesan biscotti over the last two days&#8230;Excellent, both!</p>

				<p>They sounds <i>sort of</i> like Nanaimo bars.  I think those are a Canadian thing, though.</p>
<p>I made the apple pancakes with the addition of vanilla and cinnamon (perhaps half a teaspoon of each and they were so delicious.  Like apple fritters without all the grease.</p>

				<p>These look incredible but I loathe the combination of chocolate and mint with a passion. May therefore substitute almond essence for the peppermint.</p>

				<p>I make a similar recipe every year for my Sister&#8217;s Birthday. I use the Cooks Illustrated brownie, a buttercream with creme de menthe, and a chocolate glaze with butter, chocolate, and a bit of water.  Probably not as rich and creamy as yours, but they set up firm, but not hard.</p>

				<p>Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy </p>
<p>Stop it with the delicious desserts that I HAVE to make, seriously.<br />
You read my mind, I was going to bake brownies for a party tomorrow, and damn it, now I will probably make these instead. And I just made your seven-layer cookies (gluten free- <a href="http://www.heythattastesgood.com/2008/12/seven-layer-cookies.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.heythattastesgood.com/2008/12/seven-layer-cookies.html)</a> on top of the 15 different kinds of cookies I have been making to give people for Christmas, this is the last thing I need!!!!</p>

				<p>Hm, interesting.  I tried Cook Illustrated&#8217;s mint brownies recently, and I didn&#8217;t love them.  One of the problems, though, was that I accidentally bought mint extract and not peppermint extract.  It tastes like spearmint.  But also, the mint layer was too powdered sugary.  I wonder if using white chocolate instead would solve that.  It&#8217;s a good idea.</p>

				<p>I love these already.<br />
But, I want to ask you make something when you have the time.  Scallion Pancakes.  They are one of my favorite Chinese food appetizers and sometime in the future I plan to make them.  But, if you make them first and blog about it, I might get it right the first time when I make them!  Please forgive my laziness!  I moved to Florida a year and a half ago and can&#8217;t find one place that makes these.  I am in need of a fix, but with a very active baby, too tired to do this myself yet.</p>

				<p>Oh so pretty.  I&#8217;m full up for xmas on sweets (thank you very much &#8211; yeah, I was one of the ones moaning about all the sweets, but, ya know, it was all just for drama.  &#8220;Oh, another delicious recipe I have to try, poor pitiful me [swoon to floor, raising a knot on the forehead because each hand had a fresh cookie in it and couldn't be bothered to break the fall] &#8230;.&#8221;)  </p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m torn &#8211; someone mentioned almond essence instead of the mint &#8230; which to make? &#8230; maybe split the the filling and do both.  These little babies will look so pretty on a New Year&#8217;s Eve silver tray.  Oh &#8230; in the recipe, there&#8217;s a &#8220;note&#8221; about the heavy cream, but I don&#8217;t see the note.  Or was it the part about halving the cream?  I&#8217;m probably being an idiot [swoon knots cause such things, I'm sure] &#8211; if it&#8217;s there, just ignore me.  I&#8217;ll eventually find it and go, um, duhhhh.</p>

				<p>I have to make these this weekend.  Just one small clarification Deb??  In the paragraph where you griped about the ganache consistency, was the word &#8220;melt&#8221; supposed to be in the parentheses with the phrase &#8220;you’ll want to chocolate with the cream, rather than pour it over&#8221; and does that mean both the white and bittersweet?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

				<p>Deb, is it possible that my Southern gal brain and your New Yorker gal brain have somehow melded? I pulled these off the epicurious site Thursday night and made them for a little get together we hosted last night.<br />
They were a huge hit. Very rich. I&#8217;m with you on cutting them into 1 inch squares. It&#8217;s just the right amount of richness without being overwhelming. Plus, you can justify taking several tiny squares more easily than one huge one!<br />
I used the Ghiradeli white chocolate and had no problem with it. I picked it up because it was the one available and I didn&#8217;t have time to hunt up another brand. I would prefer Valrhona.<br />
I agree with your assessment of the ganache. Needs to be less soft.<br />
I also think that after they are chilled and set you should cut them into squares and then let them return to room temperature before serving in order to get the most out of the flavors.<br />
Happy Holidays.</p>

				<p>Back in the day I was so cool even my dressers were splatter painted!  These brownies look so good and I&#8217;m very interested in sticking an Andes mint in.

				<p>Leighann &#8212; Yes. When you have a larger amount of cream, just heating it to a simmer and pouring it over the chocolate is enough to melt the chocolate. Should you halve it, the heated cream will likely no longer be enough to alone melt the chocolate bits. Instead, you can melt the two together over a double boiler, or, if you feel comfortable doing so, in the microwave.

				<p>I love how food so accurately attaches itself to our memories. And I also love how foods from our childhood don&#8217;t always taste as good as we remember. Case in point? Those peanut butter cookies with the Hershey&#8217;s kiss in the middle. Those puppies are tough to eat! But thinking of them makes me think of Valentine&#8217;s Day in third grade when David Dunnick gave me my first Valentine that I thought was a legit proposal, along with one of those cookies. You can&#8217;t beat it.</p>

				<p>A great story!  Why is it that those nostalgic memories of a grandmother&#8217;s home baking are so hard to duplicate in the present?  My husband has a sweet tooth and associates baking with everything wonderful.  But when we recently discovered a parcel of recipes that had been his grandmother&#8217;s and his mother&#8217;s we were astonished at the number of &#8217;shortcut&#8217; items that they included&#8211;of very much the same calibre as the Hershey&#8217;s syrup your Grandmother used.  Your &#8216;tweaked&#8217; recipe looks wonderful.  I&#8217;m going to try it with less cream as you recommend.</p>

				<p>These look awesome!  Did you just stick with the 1 tsp peppermint extract while omitting the creme de menthe?  That&#8217;s what it sounds like you said.  But I read some reviews on epicurious and a few bakers increased the extract to compensate for omitting the creme de menthe.  Was there enough mint flavor with just 1 tsp extract?  Thanks so much!  I plan to bake these for my family this Christmas.</p>

				<p>David &#8212; Actually, I went up to 1 1/2 teaspoons, but I felt that the mint was too strong in mine. I was bummed because it was hard to taste the chocolate. At the one teaspoon level, the mint flavor was just strong enough.</p>

				<p>I used half as much cream, but it wasn&#8217;t quite enough. 3/4 the called for cream worked great.</p>
<p>Also, if your white chocolate ganache separates, reheat it and stir more thoroughly as it cools. That will help bring it back together. We did this, adding a bit more cream to make the result less firm, and it came together nicely.</p>
<p>I definitely agree that 1 teaspoon of mint was just right. More would have overwhelmed the chocolate.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been making these brownies since Gourmet published the recipe in 2005 and they&#8217;re great.  They&#8217;re also a great palate to try your favorite flavors on (besides just mint.)  I&#8217;ve tried orange, raspberry, coffee and most recently Mexican chocolate: <a href="http://elicooks.wordpress.com/2008/11/30/crack-brownies/" rel="nofollow">http://elicooks.wordpress.com/2008/11/30/crack-brownies/</a></p>

				<p>i used trader joes brand white chocolate chips to make peppermint bark this weekend and it worked very well. Melted easily, tasted great, and spread easily! It is also extremely affordable.  And since &#8220;cocoa butter&#8221; is an actual ingrediant in the chips, i was hoping for the best, and was not dissapointed.</p>

				<p>These totally remind me of your delicious dulce de leche cheesecake squares. Maybe you could use the chocolate glaze from that as the top layer here instead of the chocolate ganache? As I recall, it firmed up really nicely.</p>

				<p>These look delicious, and I agree with the others who said that they are reminiscent of the Canadian Nanaimo Bar, the mint version anyway. I still think the original custard filling cannot be surpassed.</p>
<p>I also like to see that you use Callebaut chocolate as I&#8217;m from the home of Bernard Callebaut and there really is a world of difference between it and store-brand. I suspect the Callebaut you get in the states is from a different chocolaterie but since they both descend from the same name I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s just as good.</p>

				<p>So glad to see this &#8211; I tried the gourmet version, and while good &#8211; it was frustrating to not set up.  Trying with some different chocolates (don&#8217;t have access to the ones you recommend) but hopefully will work out like yours&#8230; Also going to make them in the disposable cake pans for easy transport/sharing.

				<p>I made these and they were fantastic!  I thought the recipe was slightly funny because the ganache calls for 10 oz of chocolate and chips come in 11.5 oz bags, so I just used a whole bag.  For the ganache, since it seemed runny I whipped it and it turned out nice and light, yes it doubled in volume but that made these seem more like candies than brownies, esp since the brownie layer was so thin.    (I also omitted the creme de menthe and added a bit extra extract to compensate)</p>

Still, i topped the brownies with dark chocolate ganache and fresh blueberries and my family and boyfriend loved them, so thank you for the daily inspiration!!!</p>

				<p>I made these for my son&#8217;s bday party, and they were a big hit. Mmmm! Just thinking about them makes me want to go grab another one. I used about 2/3 the cream for the ganaches and it worked perfectly. They also firmed up alot quicker than the recipe notes. I used 1/2 tsp. creme de mente and 1/2 tsp. peppermint turned out good. I definitely wouldn&#8217;t want anymore mint though as it was pretty strong as it is.<br />
Thanks for another great recipe! (making the carbomb cupcakes for Saturday :)</p>

				<p>Oh. My. God.</p>
<p>I made these tonight for the first time for my ballroom dance team&#8217;s practice.  I had 48 brownies&#8230;two hours and 11 people later, there are four left.</p>
<p>They are AMAZING.  One person tried them, and all of a sudden I had a horde of people crowding the brownie pan.  I&#8217;ve been given offical title of &#8220;team mom&#8221;.  Oh, and the ganache set wonderfully with half the amount of cream.  I&#8217;ll be saving these for road trips to our competitions.</p>
<p>This and the cream scones were the first things I&#8217;ve tried off your website, and both came out beautifully.  I&#8217;ll definitely be trying more :-)</p>

				<p>Ok Deb&#8230;. I obviously need a tutorial on chocolate!! I come from the world of almond bark and choc. chips. I obviously can&#8217;t find the right types of chocolate for baking at my local grocery store&#8230; So do have suggestions as to where to find good chocolate for baking. I am close to the Twin Cities. Do specialty grocery stores like Kowalskis have these products? I also have a Trader Joes nearby. I need some HELP!! Please all comments are welcome.</p>

				<p>Incredible!  I only used 3/4 the amount of cream and the ganache turned out perfect&#8230; except the top layer started to seize while I was spreading it.  I had to bust out the hairdryer (don&#8217;t judge me).  So, I guess &#8220;perfect&#8221; is the wrong word.  It was my first time making ganache and I was very pleased with myself.  Everyone LOVED these brownies. They definitely need to be cut into small pieces.</p>
<p>Meridith &#8212; Trader Joe&#8217;s chocolate bars are very good quality (rumor has it that they are made by Callebaut).  You can pick them up near the registers.</p>

				<p>Can I send by wrapping each large square with parchment and plastic? Sending all my Christmas goodies from your posts. Everyone loves your homemade oreos. When is your book (or compilation) coming out? Because I will sleep in front of the bookstore to be the first to buy!</p>

				<p>Hands down, you had me at the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake.  Then the Toasted Coconut Shortbreads rocked my world.  And so one after another I fell hard time and time again.  Why would these be any different?  I made them today and they turned out great.  The 1&#8243; size is perfect I think.  The texture is a bit homogenous so small bites of chocolate minty goodness are just right.  Quite a few years ago a recipe for grasshoppers was going around that used Swiss Miss hot chocolate mix in the base &#8212; pretty weird, huh?  Anyway, I used Green &amp; Black&#8217;s white chocolate (my absolute favorite &#8212; I have dreams about it) and then their dark chocolate.  The dark ganache broke so I had to make it over using Trader Joe&#8217;s dark which did the trick (and was alot less expensive).  For me, the trick to making a smooth ganache is chopping the chocolate very fine so that it melts quickly in the cream.  Oh, and I did cut the cream down to 1/4 cup for the white ganache and 1/2 cup for the dark and it worked out just fine.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>

				<p>These sound absolutely divine&#8230;  I&#8217;ve recently started becoming a real fan of mint and chocolate together.  I must make these after I &#8220;dispose&#8221; of all the baked goods stashed in my freezer!  =)</p>

				<p>Didn&#8217;t check all of the comments so I may have missed it, but do you think using Half and Half would cause a big difference? I have a ton left over and would like to use it before it goes bad. Or could I possibly add something to correct the thickness? Or find a new recipe? I know you stick to a &#8216;I don&#8217;t know what I haven&#8217;t tried&#8217; policy, but I&#8217;m interested in your opinion.</p>

				<p>my mom made these when I was growing up, and I&#8217;ve been making them for the last 35 years or so&#8230; perfect, every time.  The top layer recipies are completely different, though.  for the mint layer: 6 Tbsp melted butter / blend with 3 cups powdered sugar (this will make a very thick paste) / add 3 Tbsp cream, 1/2 tsp peppermint extract, few drops of green food coloring.  spread over brownies while they are still warm. for the top chocolate layer: melt together 1.5 oz UNsweetened chocolate and 1.5 Tbsp butter. when mint layer is firm, pour over the top and spread gently &#8211; sometimes I double this, to ensure a thick enough coating.<br />
you&#8217;d think that the unsweetened chocolate would be too much, but with the sweet of the mint layer it works out just fine and adds an intense chocolate flavor. also: these slice up nicely, with clearly defined layers and no smudging!</p>

				<p>I was expecting REAL grasshoppers, and I&#8217;m now undecided if I&#8217;m relieved or disappointed!  All joking aside, it&#8217;s a great recipe just like most of your amazing food.  Can&#8217;t wait until the cookbook!</p>

				<p>Hi&#8211;</p>
<p>I bought peppermint extract, and I wasn&#8217;t sure if I have to buy mint extract as well.  I just don&#8217;t want to buy something I don&#8217;t have to and may not use again.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

				<p>I used Callebaut white chocolate, but I still had terrible separation. The ganache was a gloppy ball of greenish chocolate in a vat of oil. As per the suggestion by Michael L, i reheated it, added a touch more cream, and stirred the c**p out of it. That seems to have solved the problem. Yum!<br />
Definitely considering replacing the mint with hazelnut syrup next time.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,<br />
I made these brownies the other day at work and even though I thought the required amount of flour was less than it should have been, I followed your recipe exactly. The brownies tasted delicious, but it was the consisitency of &#8220;brownie batter&#8221; you&#8217;d find in ice cream. I was just wondering if 3/4 cup of flour was a possible typo?<br />
Also, the amount of batter I made from your recipe was only enough for a 10&#8243;x 6&#8243;x 4&#8243; pan (1/2 a 4&#8243; hotel pan) and the yield you gave read 72 normal brownies and 117 1&#8243; brownies; I got 12 brownies. I&#8217;m not complaining by any means, just making sure if I read the recipe right or not.<br />
Thanks!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb, </p>
<p>just to let you know &#8211; I made these using half the cream stated for the ganaches and the consistency was perfect in both. The brownies are absolutely delicious and they look great. Also, I made them in a 9&#8243; square pan and divided the recipe by two-thirds which works perfectly. 1&#8243; brownies are great, as they&#8217;re quite rich. Just heading to the kitchen now to make another batch for my friend&#8217;s birthday, no doubt they&#8217;ll be much appreciated! Thanks for the recipe, I know I&#8217;ll get a lot of use out of it!</p>

				<p>Hi Deb! You say you skipped the creme de menthe because you found the mint flavor srong enough. Did you use some other sort of mint flavor AND peppermint or just the peppermint (so only1 tsp of some sort of flavoring when in the mint layer)? thanks!</p>
