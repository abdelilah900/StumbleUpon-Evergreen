<p>I use the word &#8220;favorite&#8221; too often. But this time I think I mean it. This cake is the cake I make for myself. I don&#8217;t share it. I don&#8217;t bring it to work. I don&#8217;t even let Bryan have a slice unless he begs or I am feeling particularly enamored with him. It is everything I could want in a sweet. A moist buttermilk cake with a healthy crumb topped with a creamy caramel glaze. The cake is just the right amount of sweet. I&#8217;ve made this so many times and each time I fall in love with it all over again.<span id="more-1246"></span></p>

<p>Of course even as I type this I am thinking of other favorite cakes, which I will eventually get around to sharing— but this is the most important. Make it for yourself and don&#8217;t share it with anyone.</p>
<p>GREEN CITY MARKET REMINDER: If you&#8217;re in Chicago, don&#8217;t forget that the <a href="http://www.chicagogreencitymarket.org/" target="_blank">Green City Market</a> is still up and running all winter long! Every other Saturday indoors at the Nature Museum. Lots of great vendors and plenty of chef demonstrations. Recent purchases include: yukon gold potatoes, pecans!, corn meal, goat cheese that looks like a rock!, honey infused with chili, and eggs, eggs, eggs! Get out there and support your farmers and food makers and make a political statement: we want organic local food all year! We care where our food comes from!</p>
<p><strong>Caramel Cake</strong> (<em>Gourmet</em>, January 2008)</p>
<p>Cake:</p>
<ul id="ingredientsList">
<li>2 cups plus 2 tablespoons sifted cake flour (not self-rising; sift before measuring)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 stick (4 oz) unsalted butter, softened</li>
<li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 large eggs, at room temperature 30 minutes</li>
<li>1 cup well-shaken buttermilk</li>
</ul>
<p>Caramel Glaze:</p>
<ul id="ingredientsList">
<li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
<li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon light corn syrup</li>
<li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Make cake:</strong><br />
Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Butter an 8-inch square cake pan and line bottom with a square of parchment paper, then butter parchment.</p>
<p>Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</p>
<p>Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until pale and fluffy, then beat in vanilla. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. At low speed, beat in buttermilk until just combined (mixture may look curdled). Add flour mixture in 3 batches, mixing until each addition is just incorporated.</p>
<p>Spread batter evenly in cake pan, then rap pan on counter several times to eliminate air bubbles. Bake until golden and a toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack for 10 minutes, then run a knife around edge of pan. Invert onto rack and discard parchment, flip cake so it is right-side up and then cool completely, about 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>Make glaze:</strong><br />
Bring cream, brown sugar, corn syrup, and a pinch of salt to a boil in a 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Boil until glaze registers 210 to 212°F on thermometer, 12 to 14 minutes, then stir in vanilla.</p>
<p>Put rack with cake in a shallow baking pan and pour hot glaze over top of cake, allowing it to run down sides. Cool until glaze is set, about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>*** Confession time: I don&#8217;t sift the flour first. Instead, I just sift 2 cups of cake flour and call it a day. Bad, I know. But I feel like the lack of sifting is made up for by the 2 tablespoons of flour I am omitting, right?</p>

Why do you use unsalted butter in most recipes? Is using unsalted butter a health choice or does unsalted butter have a cooking purpose?</p>

<p>Hey Karin&#8217;s Mom: Recipes call for unsalted butter as a way of controlling salt content. Since salted butters all contain different amounts of salt it would be impossible to predict final results. Recipes would not be as accurately duplicated. By using unsalted butter and adding salt yourself you are more likely to replicate what the recipe&#8217;s creator had in mind. You can still use salted butter for a recipe like this, you would just reduce the additional salt you are adding to the recipe. In this recipe I would probably just add a pinch of salt. Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Wish we had a good year round market!  That&#8217;s one of the only reasons I wish I lived somewhere like CA or FL instead of NM!  Even though I kill my basil plant every year, considering a small garden for the fresh vegs.  Just have to remember to water!</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>The cake looks grand. I just don&#8217;t get how you make it consistently with such vague quantities. F&#8217;rinstance:<br />
2 cups + 2 tblsp flour &#8211; what does that weigh?<br />
1 cup sugar &#8211; weight? brown? white? granulated? castor?<br />
1 stick butter &#8211; Stick? lb? oz? kilo? gram?<br />
1 cup buttermilk &#8211; Oh, you measure liquids AND solids by volume huh? fl.oz? cls?<br />
Oh, and does a cup of &#8216;heavy&#8217; cream weigh as much as a cup of &#8216;light&#8217; corn syrup?<br />
Jeez!<br />
America and Britain &#8211; two nations separated by a common language.</p>

<p>Oh, of course you guys are right that the US is in a crazy measurement world of their own. I added some additional info up above, but you are absolutely right that we should be weighing! Also, I tend to use these two tools, when I am having the opposite problem:<br />

Generally in the USA, if one does not specify which sugar, they mean the white granulated sugar.<br />
One cup in the USA is a volume (approximately 250mL), not a weight. So really it is accurate for fluids to be measured this way, but solids would not be perfectly consistent. Generally using a cup for solids is good enough though, as you do not need to be ultra accurate to get a consistent enough cake id you always use ingredients with the same qualities. ie, if sugar always weights the same for a constant volume, then you can just scoop it up with your cup measurement and be sure you have the same amount as the last time.<br />
Also, in the USA a stick of butter is standardized to 4oz. or 1/2 cup of butter.</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>jjabraham, I agree with everything except &#8220;Generally using a cup for solids is good enough though, as you do not need to be ultra accurate to get a consistent enough cake&#8221;&#8230;it&#8217;s not the ingredients that are a problem, it has to do with the environment.  If it&#8217;s really humid out, a cup of flour may be much heavier than a cup of flour on a dry day.  This is mostly a problem when making large quantities of a recipe, but sometimes even a small cake can be affected enough for it not to come out quite like you wanted it to.  One example I&#8217;ve seen is when I make pancakes, sometimes I need to add a bit more flour because of the humidity.  Otherwise, they can be pretty runny and make thin, flat pancakes instead of fluffy ones.</p>

<p>Hi Anna: Yes, I think you could use all-purpose. I think the rule is that you use less all-purpose to replace cake flour. So, maybe a scant 2 cups? Good luck!</p>

<p>After living in the US and returning to England, I was pleased to find you can buy the same size measuring cups in places like tesco etc. I actually prefer baking using cups for measurement now, so if you can find some, I&#8217;d definitely say it&#8217;s worth the three-to-five pounds they cost.  :)</p>

The texture was a little like a light cornbread, and it was really not too sweet. I loved the glaze.

<p>Hi Joan:<br />
Yes, you can try honey. I would try to find a really mild flavored honey. Or, I wonder if golden syrup is available? (Lyle&#8217;s?) Either should function in the same way as corn syrup in the recipe. Let me know if it works!</p>
<p>Ingrid: No, it doesn&#8217;t make you a mean mom! Even moms deserve their own piece of cake. </p>
<p>Faye: Glad it worked. I bet it is good with salted butter. </p>
<p>Chrissy: I haven&#8217;t tried that. I think you could double the cake pretty easily, my concern would be with the glaze. It is worth a try, or simply make two batches of the glaze.</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>This cake keeps getting recommended, and though I don&#8217;t think it could ever become a favorite (I am not madly in love with caramel), I think I&#8217;ll certainly give it a try.<br />
By the way, 2 cups of flour + 2 tablespoons would not be 17 ounces as someone mentioned above! That would be more like 3 cups of flour. All-purpose flour is about 4.5-5 ounces, and cake flour around 4-4.5.<br />
And honey isn&#8217;t a very good substitute for corn syrup when making caramel. Glucose syrup is usually the substitute in Europe, or golden syrup.</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>I made this cake last night. It was totally awesome. My family was so impressed.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Now this cake is our FAVORITE too. I have a question though. Why do you need to put salt ( a pinch) in the glaze?  Can we do without it?<br />
thanks!!</p>

<p>Aparna: I am SO glad you liked it. Salt is used in desserts to enhance flavors. It is actually quite important in very sweet things like the caramel glaze- it helps keep things balanced. I usually even increase the amount of salt dessert recipes call for because I think it is such an important addition. You can experiment though and see what you think of the glaze without the salt, whatever tastes best to you is right!</p>

<p>Hi Rachel: Go buy a candy thermometer! OR, just wing it and hope for the best. If you are familiar with making caramels you will know when it is getting to the right consistency, but the best thing to do is check temperature. Maybe you can borrow one from a friend?<br />
As for a corn syrup replacement, I haven&#8217;t found anything that works as well so I just use corn syrup in candy making. I know people have tried things like honey, simple syrup and agave syrup, If you Google around you will also find recipes for substitutes made using cream of tartar.</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>Since I moved to Sarajevo for work, i find myself in a incredibly difficult situation for baking. My level of bosnian is so bad at the moment that I stare at the products at the supermarket for ages try to make-up with which flour is self-rising and which is not&#8230; and maybe wishing it would somehow reveiled itself to me.<br />

			<div class="comment"><p>We made this cake this evening, and it is delicious.  I have a question about the texture of the cake itself though.  Our cake is very fine, more like an angel food cake than a dense, moist heavy crumb type of vibe.  I pretty much followed the instructions&#8230;only thing is I didn&#8217;t have an electric mixer so I did it all by hand.  Could that be the cause of the &#8220;off&#8221; texture?  It was still pretty great, just curious.</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>Hey Tim, </p>
<p>   I had been saving this recipe for a while, and finally baked it for my neighbors when their apartment got broken into. I served it up on a giant clam platter (a little strange, but it pooled up the caramel nicely) and they devoured the whole thing. I might have helped. Thanks, this cake is delectable.</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>I made this tonight, with a bit of a handicap—no electric mixer or candy thermometer. But, I have a strong arm and a meat thermometer, so decided it was worth a try. The edges of the cake were crispy and that caramel sauce&#8230; divine. Saved it from a minor disaster because it broke when I was trying to flip it! Thankfully none of it hit the floor. Aside from that, I love that it&#8217;s not your typical cake. Thanks so much for sharing!!</p>

<p>2.

Do you have some magical frosting recipe??  I know you go for delicious over decorative, but thought you might have an idea.</p>

<p>Hi Claudia- you can make a buttermilk substitute by mixing 1 cup whole milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice. Stir it together and let it sit for 5 minutes. Use as you would buttermilk.</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>Hey, Tim -</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been slowly working my way through your lovely blog since discovering it last week. This cake looks perfect in its simplicity – if I dare make sweets any time soon, I&#8217;ll be giving this a try. </p>
<p>Reading through the comments here, I took note of the question about salted vs. unsalted butter. This is something I&#8217;ve pondered and researched in some depth. Yes, the simple answer is that salted butter varies in the amount of salt used, so using unsalted butter allows the cook to control the salt content. But I noticed early on that unsalted butter just plain tastes better – cleaner, clearer, fresher.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: salt was originally added to butter as a preservative. Salted butter can be expected to stay &#8216;fresher&#8217; longer than unsalted. So I wonder – do butter makers make more salted butter than unsalted, because a) salted is more popular but b) it can hang around on the shelf longer without going &#8216;off&#8217; (even though it starts to get a little tired)?</p>
<p>Another thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that salted butter tends to have a lot more crud in it – milk solids – which becomes obvious when you melt it, and especially when you clarify it. The milk solids are actually what goes &#8216;off&#8217; in butter, which is why clarified butter will last seemingly forever (see also &#8216;ghee&#8217;). And I wonder&#8230;are commercial butter makers sloppier about making salted butter, taking less care to wash out the buttermilk because they know the salt will cover up for it?</p>
<p>I got in the habit over the years of buying and using unsalted butter for everything, because of its superior flavor (and performance). These days, I make my own, but that&#8217;s another story.</p>
<p>Apologies for being so long-winded and overly thinky. I look forward to discovering more of your blog.</p>
<p>GG</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>I distinctly remember avoiding this recipe when it was published in Gourmet because I knew it would get me into trouble. But last week I rediscovered it in this post, and as a hoarder of sweets myself I knew I had to make it. Last night was the night&#8211;husband working night shift, baby sleeping, new novel, caramel cake. I tried to keep my expectations for the cake in check, but I needn&#8217;t have&#8211;totally scrumptious (although my glaze did not look as opaque and smooth as yours). Thanks!</p>
<p>(And no, I did NOT eat the whole thing, but I was a bit shocked when a previous commenter said he had polished it off with two other people, and now that makes perfect sense.)</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>Hi Tim! Your website is lovely. I&#8217;m an amateur blogger and cupcake aficionado, and came across your website in my search for a good caramel cake recipe. One of my sorority sisters requested caramel cake-cupcakes for a bridal shower she&#8217;s planning, so I was wondering if you had any tips on translating this recipe to cupcakes? I&#8217;ll be experimenting a little today, but I just had to comment and compliment your work. And PS: I&#8217;m jealous of your photography skills!

<p>Hi Tamara, Thanks for the nice message! I think that these will be complicated as cupcakes. The glaze won&#8217;t have anywhere to go if you bake them in paper liners and if you don&#8217;t bake them in paper liners they sort of become mini-cakes rather than cupcakes (you wouldn&#8217;t be able to pick them up). I&#8217;ll be curious to hear how your experiments turn out. Good luck and happy baking!</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>Hi Tim! I made cupcakes using the cake recipe, and they turned out great in terms of taste and consistency; I just baked them for about 5 fewer minutes. I love the tang from the buttermilk and that they aren&#8217;t too sweet. You&#8217;re right about the glaze: it would be a little messy to use on cupcakes. My friend had requested a fluffy frosting, southern style, so I made a vanilla meringue buttercream, and added a caramel sauce very much like the glaze (I made a dark caramel, and mixed in heavy cream). The frosting had a great, really pronounced caramel flavor and helps with the mess issue a lot. Thanks for the help!</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>Thanks for this recipe and reviews!  My husband asked for a caramel cake for his birthday, and I read horror stories about caramel that &#8220;hardened like a helmet&#8221; on other sites.  This cake was easy to make, and for the first time since knowing my husband, I NAILED THE BIRTHDAY CAKE!  He has asked that I make it every year! (and it tastes great with Turtle Tracks ice cream, too!)</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>I&#8217;ve never even thought of a caramel cake, as it usually seems that it would get rock hard solid and impossible to eat. This looks so light! I&#8217;m excited to try it, from the rage reviews its gotten, I&#8217;m sure it will be a hit!<br />

<p>the first time i made it i was paranoid that the caramel wasn&#8217;t thick enough, but now i appreciate how it just slowly seeps in around the edges&#8230; yuuuum</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>All of this recent paranoia about the need for EXACT measurements for baking has reminded me that our grandmothers didn&#8217;t use consistent measurements at all, and they were the ones after whose baking we tend to lust!

<p>Hey Talia,<br />
Yes, it can definitely be made the day before. No need to refrigerate, just keep at room temperature. The cake is perfect for the first 2 days and then still totally enjoyable for a couple of more days&#8230;.</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>WHOA. This was a pregnant lady&#8217;s dream come true. Thank you, sir. </p>
<p>I used AP Flour (scant 2C), honey instead of corn syrup, and I didn&#8217;t have a candy thermometer so I boiled the caramel mixture for about 13 minutes. Next time I will boil for a few minutes less as I think a thinner sauce would coat the cake better. I was so antsy that I even forgot to add in the vanilla (!). So, I pretty much butchered your recipe but It was still delish! Thank you!</p>

I made your favorite cake twice now and it is truly wonderful.  The second time that I made it, I used regular flour instead of cake flour.  The key is sifting it both times. Could I link the recipe back to your blog?  Thanks, Tien</p>

			<div class="comment"><p>Hi Tim! I just stumbled upon your blog today from the delicious-looking porridge post over on Kitchn. Your food looks AMAZEBALLS. I&#8217;m a grad student who&#8217;s learning to cook more, and I&#8217;m now really looking forward to the holidays since I&#8217;ll be getting a electric mixer. This cake looks so yummy that I can&#8217;t wait to try baking this. Fortunately, my baking skills is much better than cooking, hehe.</p>
