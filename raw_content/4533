your nog party with your name and location to eggnogpix&#64;256.com. </p>

<p> This is my <a href="#grandfather">grandfather's</a> eggnog recipe.
It is a rich, creamy, and truly delicious version of the holiday
drink.  I do not know if he concocted it himself or picked it up
somewhere.  I've tuned it a bit to balance the cream and sugar and to
(in 2009) lower the whiskey and increase the rum which I like
better. </p>

<p> <b> Please note </b> that this eggnog is a potent alcoholic
beverage.  Please encourage the members of your party to bring a
designated driver if they plan on drinking.  To lower the alcohol in
the recipe, use lower proof whiskey and/or rum, or substitute a cup of
milk for every cup of alcohol removed. </p>

<h3> Eggnog Recipe Instructions </h3>

<p> You are doing things <i> gently </i> and <i> slowly </i> to
preserve the eggnog's fluffiness.  A good whisk for the stirring and a
high speed mixer for the egg-whites and cream helps this process
immensely.  Notes on <a href="#party">taking this to a party
below</a>. </p>

<ol>

<li> Separate eggs into yolks and whites in separate bowls (<a
href="#separating">see below for a how-to</a>).  I put the whites into
the mixer and the yolks into another bowl. </li>

<li> Beat egg-yolks with 1/2 of sugar, set aside. </li>
<li> Beat egg-whites until stiff, then mix in other 1/2 of sugar. </li>
<li> Pour the yolks into the whites and mix together slowly. </li>
<li> Stir in white rum slowly.  I've tried dark rum and it works. </li>
<li> Stir in milk slowly (see below for <a href="#dairy">dairy
intolerance</a>) </li>
<li> Stir in whiskey slowly (Bourbon, Canadian, Sour Mash.  I use Jim
Beam or Jack Daniels) </li>
<li> Stir in 1/2 of cream slowly </li>
<li> Whip rest (1/2) of cream and fold it into the mixture
<i>carefully</i>.  Notes on <a href="#folding">how to fold</a>
below. </li>
<li> Serve at room temperature by ladling the eggnog into <a
href="#punch">cups</a> and sprinkle nutmeg on the top.  Information on
<a href="#grinders">nutmeg grinders</a> below.  Try to get some of the
foam and some of the liquid (if not fully mixed) in each cup.  </li>

<h3> Notes </h3>

<ul class="spc">

<li> <b>Drinking responsibly:</b> Albeit strong, this eggnog recipe
makes a truly delicious drink -- I am quite biased of course.  This
translates into the fact that you need to make more than you expect
since it will be consumed faster.  This also means that you should
encourage people to bring their designated drivers if they are
interested in sampling.  If you see me intoxicated (hosting, walking,
or backseat driving I assure you) around the time of the holidays, you
will know the reason why. </li>

<li> <b>Nonalcoholic:</b> If you wish to leave out the nog, this
recipe can be made nonalcoholic by substituting an equal amounts of
milk for the rum and whiskey and it is still delicious.  You can also
try adding more heavy cream.  A teaspoon of vanilla will also add
flavor missing from the alcohol.  I've not tried it personally and I'd
love to get more feedback on this.  I understand and respect the
question, but to me, making eggnog without alcohol is akin to making
lemon-aid without the lemons. </li>

<li> <a name="eggs"><b>Raw eggs:</b></a> People ask about the raw eggs
in the eggnog.  My grandfather always said that the alcohol "cures"
the eggs although I'm not sure that's true.  I tried pasteurized eggs
in 2004 and they do <i>not</i> work.  They didn't separate well and
the whites did not froth up at all.  The FDA says that in
unpasteurized eggs, one in 20,000 contain bad bacteria.  I have made
(and drunk) at least 100 batches and have never felt ill or had one of
my guests feel bad.  I usually buy the eggs just before I made the
eggnog and keep them well refrigerated.  In 2005 I made a batch with
some organic eggs laid the day before and I've never had such yolks or
foam.  Yummy!  I try to smell the egg when I crack it open and
although I have never gotten a bad egg over the years -- I did get
some bad cream.  You can also try gently lowering the eggs into a
container of water.  Bad eggs should float because of a build up of
gases, old eggs should sink slowly, while good eggs should sink nicely
to the bottom of the container.  You should never use unclean,
cracked, broken or leaking eggs. </li>

<li> <a href="lactaid.jpg"><img src="lactaid_t.jpg" width="48"
height="65" alt="Lactaid" align="right" border="0" /></a><a
name="dairy"><b>Dairy intolerance:</b></a> If you (or your guests)
are lactose intolerant, there are a couple of options.  This is
different from a milk allergy which precludes all dairy products.
I've not tried it but I hear that <a
href="http://www.lactaid.com/products/index.jhtml?id=lactaid/products/milk.inc"
>Lactaid milk</a> found in many large markets tastes just like normal
milk, maybe a bit sweeter.  I assume it would be fine in eggnog.  I
have used sweet acidophilus milk which tastes like normal milk but has
beneficial cultures and some varieties are lactose free.  There are
also milk alternative like <a
href="http://www.vancesfoods.com/articles.asp?ID=7&amp;Click=400" >Vance's DariFree</a>
which I would think would work.  If you have folks with intolerance,
you could separate out some of the mixture made with one of these
lactose-free milks for them to enjoy before you add any heavy cream.
It will be less thick and a little stronger but it should be tasty.
Others have used soy-based Silk coffee creamer as a thickener in place
of the cream. </li>

<li> <a href="punch_cup.jpg"><img src="punch_cup_t.jpg" width="105"
height="65" alt="Punch cup" align="right" border="0" /></a><a
name="punch"><b>Punch Cups:</b></a> Eggnog is traditionally served in
small crystal glasses or <a href="punch_cup.jpg">punch cups</a> which
can be found in the US for ~$2 each in many antique stores. </li>

<li><b>French toast:</b> Although certainly almost as good as a drink
the next morning, eggnog can be refrigerated overnight and used at
breakfast by soaking bread in it and frying till browned for some
excellent French toast -- adding butter and syrup at will. </li>

<li> <p> <a name="separating"><b>Separating (how-to):</b></a> I
usually separate the egg yolk from the white by carefully cracking an
egg over a cup and then slowly opening it up so that the bottom half
of the shell holds the yolk.  The excess white will run out into the
cup.  Then very carefully switch the yolk to the other half of the
shell letting more white run out into the cup.  Do this a couple of
more times slowly keeping the yolk from mixing at all with the whites.
When you are done you can transfer the yolk into a bowl with the
others and the whites (with no yolk in it) into the bowl with the
whites.  If the yolk breaks at all then discard immediately. </p>

<p> Another method is to crack the egg open over a bowl keeping the
yolk into one half of the shell like the above.  But instead of
switching the yolk from one half-shell into another, just pour it down
slowly into your hand keeping your fingers close to one another. The
white will seep through your fingers while the yolk will stay in your
hand.  When the white has seeped out, lay the yolk into a separate
bowl.  One problem with this method is that any contamination on the
shells will be transferred to the yolk and white.  Also,
<i>careful</i> hand-washing is necessary prior to this operation. </p>

<p> WARNING: With such a large number of eggs, it is recommended that
for each egg, you separate the whites into a cup and then pour this
cup into a larger container upon success.  If you break a yolk into
the whites you can then discard only that egg.  Separating failures
usually result on the last egg and will ruin the whites if any yolk
gets in.  A dozen eggs can be suddenly quite hard to find one holiday
evening.  If you do manage to drop some yolk into the whites, see if
you can fish it out cleanly with a spoon immediately. </p>

<a href="egg_separator.jpg"><img src="egg_separator_t.jpg" width="87"
height="65" alt="Egg separator" align="right" border="0" /></a>

<p> NOTE: I have used with limited success an <a
href="http://www.surlatable.com/product/id/129985.do?mr:trackingCode=C662AEDC-D781-DE11-B7F3-0019B9C043EB&amp;mr:referralID=NA"
>egg separator tool</a>.  This is a little device which captures the
yolks and allows the whites to run into the container below.  It will
not save you from a broken yolk but does speed up the process a
bit. </p>

</li>

<li> <a name="folding"><b>Folding (how-to):</b></a> Julia Child
suggests using a rubber spatula, dealing with 1/3 of the mixture of a
time, and rotating the bowl until blended.  Putting the spatula into
the mixture and essentially bringing up to the top what was on the
bottom.  Move the bowl and do it again and keep doing it until the
mixture has some consistency.  In other words it is not still mostly
whipped cream here and other there, but an airy light mixture
generally.  I've also used a whisk to fold with success. </li>

<li> <a name="party"><b>Taking to a party:</b></a> If you are trying
to take some eggnog to a party, you have a couple of options.
Recently, I did the egg-whites, yolks, and sugar steps and put that
foamy mixture in one container.  Then I mixed all of the "nog" liquids
(without the cream) into a second container.  Then I brought the heavy
cream which I added and whipped on site.  You could also add the heavy
cream liquid in with the other liquids and whip and take the rest of
the cream in a third container. </li>

<li> <a href="nutmeg_grinder.jpg"><img src="nutmeg_grinder_t.jpg"
width="87" height="65" alt="nutmeg Grinder" align="right" border="0"
/></a><a name="grinders"><b>Nutmeg Grinders:</b></a> Grinders or
graters allow you to use whole nutmeg nuts which about the size of a
large olive and are quite hard.  I usually grind the nutmeg right on
top of the individual eggnog servings although grinding a bunch into a
shaker immediately ahead of the party will also work.  The pre-ground
stuff is just not as flavorful.  I've also noticed that older nutmegs
left over from last year are good but tend to jam the grinders more.
You should be able to find a grinder at your local kitchen store.  You
can also use a microplane with great results -- just watch your
fingers.  If not, here are some online sources.

<li> <p> <a name="grandfather"><b>History:</b></a> My grandfather,
Cyril K. Collins, was Assistant Vice President in charge of the
Traffic Department of the Bell System, back when it was the sole US
telephone company.  He proposed and implemented such technologies as
call-time discounts, testified before Congress numerous times about
changes in regulations, and was involved with the introduction of
direct-dialing and area codes.  Before this all calls were routed by
operators.  He would have been fascinated by the transition of
computers from telephone switching systems into the backbone of the
information age. </p>

<p> Just exchanged email with a woman who said that this was her
father's recipe as well.  As far as she knew her father got it from
her grandfather who moved came over to Winnipeg, Canada from
Lancashire, England.  Interesting.  Also heard that nog in Dutch can
mean more which may explain the derivation of the name.  This is also
true in Afrikaans which is a form of old Dutch.  Another reader sent
me mail commenting that Irish and Scottish receipes that he's seen are
very close to this.  My grandfather's family emigrated from Ireland so
maybe he brought it with him. </p>

</li>

<li> <b>Website traffic:</b> Here are <a href="eggnog_hits.png"
>graphs of the hits</a> to my eggnog recipe page over the years.  I'm
always amused by them.  Hope it implies that this means that 1000s of
batches of my grandfather's nog is being made each season.  That
would, I hope, amuse him as well. </li>
