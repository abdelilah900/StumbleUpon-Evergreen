<p>The difference between mediocre bread and excellent bread usually has less to do with the ingredients being used than the process involved in creating it.  Once you are comfortable with the basic process of mix, knead, rise, shape, and bake, your experimentation with the process can begin.  </p>
<p>The two simplest variables in the process to modify are time and temperature.  Below I will discuss how time and temperature change the character of your loaf of bread and then bake a loaf to show you how minor adjustments to the process can improve the quality of your bread significantly.<br clear="right" /><br />
<b>Time</b></p>
<p>Longer, slower fermentation extracts more flavor from your flour.  If you are baking a simple white sandwich bread or in a hurry and you just want the darned thing to rise, you can put two or even three teaspoons of yeast into your dough and get the loaf to rise in under an hour.  But if you want to create a rustic bread with a rich, nutty flavor, reducing the yeast and allow more and longer rises is appropriate.</p>
<p><b>Temperature's Impact on Rising</b></p>
<p>The warmer the temperature, the more active your yeast will be.  The more active your yeast is, the quicker the dough rises.  Simple enough, but you can use this in a multitude of ways.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you want to speed up a rise, turn your oven on for 30 seconds, turn it off, and then place your dough into the slightly-above-room-temperature oven.  It should rise noticeably quicker.</li>
<li>If you need to leave halfway through preparing to bake a loaf, you can throw it into the fridge.  It'll continue to rise in there at a much slower pace.</li>
<li>You can make a large batch of pizza dough and freeze individual pieces of it in freezer bags.  The yeast will survive at least a month or two in the freezer.  The day before you want to make the pizza, just move it to the fridge to thaw it and then pull it out of the fridge when you want it begin its final rise.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Temperature's Impact on Baking</b></p>
<p>Temperature also has an impact on how your loaf bakes.  The general rule is that crusty breads should be baked at as high a temperature as possible.  Soft shelled breads should be baked at lower temperatures.  When you increase the temperature of your oven your bread bakes quicker (duh).  </p>
<p>Professional bakers of rustic breads use ovens that achieve higher temperatures than home ovens achieve.  Turning the temperature of your oven up when baking rustic breads will help you get closer to professional quality loaves.  Buying a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?search-type=ss&amp;tag=froglallabout-20&amp;keyword=pizza%20stone&amp;mode=kitchen">pizza</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?search-type=ss&amp;tag=froglallabout-20&amp;keyword=baking%20stone&amp;mode=kitchen">baking stone</a> is another inexpensive method of capturing more heat in your oven and improving the quality of your bread (I have shattered two of these, so I don't currently bake with one.  I'll probably end up getting another one some day, but I can't say the quality of my bread has suffered that much without one).  </p>
<p>If you get <i>really</i> serious about bread baking, there is even a movement of bread hobbyest who build large hearth ovens in their backyards to reproduce professional quality loaves.  Pick up a copy of  "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=froglallabout-20&amp;path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2F1890132055%2Fqid%3D1106609529%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fref%3Dsr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14%3Fv%3Dglance%26s%3Dbooks%26n%3D507846">The Bread Builders</a>" if this interests you.  </p>
<p>My wife is pleased that I have not gotten <i>that</i> crazy about baking good bread at home (yet). </p>
<p><b>Time and Temperature Together</b></p>
<p>As you can see, time and temperature work in opposition to one another during dough formation: increase the temperature, decrease the time that your loaf rises; decrease the temperature, increase the time it takes to get to full size. </p>
<p>In the rising stage, if you are striving to extract the maximum flavor from your flour, you want to slow the rise down.  If you want a make a quick loaf in time for dinner, speed the rise up.  </p>
<p>While baking, If you want a crusty bread, you'll want to increase the temperature of the oven and reduce the amount of time your loaf bakes.  For soft, pillowy breads, do the opposite (more time at a lower temperature).  There are times when either technique is appropriate, so don't be worried that you aren't doing things the "right" way!</p>
<p><b>One Other Tidbit: Steam and Crust</b></p>
<p>For the first five or ten minutes of baking, having steam in the oven will improve the quality of your crust.  Steam does two things: first, it keeps the outside of the loaf from drying out until the dough has fully risen; second, steam coagulates the starches on the outside of the loaf, which improves the color and texture the crust.</p>
<p>Professional bakers have ovens that inject steam during the early baking phase.  Home bakers can use a lot of different tricks to recreate this effect.  The simplest method I have found has been to put an old metal brownie pan on the bottom shelf of the oven when preheating.  Right after I put the loaf into the oven, I pour a cup of hot water into the pan.  It immediately begins to bubble and boil, releasing a nice steam cloud that seems to improve my crust.</p>
<p>Don't do this with a glass pan. I did this once and it shattered as soon as I poured the water into it. </p>
<p>There are other ways of introducing moisture: spraying the walls of the oven with a squirt bottle, putting a pan full of water with a hole in the bottom onto the bottom shelf so that it drips onto the bottom of the oven, or rubbing the outside of the loaf with water are some of the common ways.  Hot water in a pan works well enough for me.</p>
<p>Also be aware that some bakers have experienced malfunctions in their oven's electronics systems from the moisture caused while trying to create steam.  Indeed, adding steam may void your oven's warranty.  I've never had any problems doing this, but please consider these risks versus the reward of highly crusty bread before attempting to steam your oven.  Let the "baker beware."</p>
<p><b>Today's Loaf</b></p>
<p>I started with the base recipe from Lesson One.  I was shooting for a crusty, rustic style bread, so I decided to reduce the amount of yeast to try to slow the fermentation process down.  In fact, to extend the fermentation process even longer I split the dough creation into two stages: one stage I started the night before and then refrigerated.  The next day I added the dough (also known as the sponge) from stage one to more ingredients to create my final dough.  </p>
<p>This method, typically known as the sponge or barm method, is a tried and true method for improving the flavor of your bread (and one I'll write more about in future lessons).  I'm more-or-less using Peter Reinhart's approach from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=froglallabout-20&amp;path=ASIN%2F1580082688%2Fqid%3D1105680350%2Fsr%3D2-1%2Fref%3Dpd_ka_b_2_1">The Bread Baker's Apprentice</a>: the stage one dough in this recipe is modeled on Peter's Pate Fermentee, and the final dough is something like his Pain de Campaign.  But bakers have been using different variations of this technique for centuries.</p>
<p><b>Day 1</b><br />
Before going to bed I mixed together:</p>
<blockquote><p>
1 cup of flour<br />
1/4 teaspoon of salt<br />
1/4 teaspoon of yeast<br />
1/2 cup of water
</p></blockquote>
<p>Mix these ingredients together in a bowl.  Pour it out onto a flat surface and kneaded the dough for about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Place the dough back into a greased bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise for an hour or so.  It won't rise a lot in that time, but the yeast will begin to wake up.</p>
<p>Punch the dough down, place it back in the bowl, cover it with with plastic wrap again and put it in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
<p><b>Day 2</b></p>
<p>When I got up, I pulled the bowl of dough out of the fridge and let it warm on the counter for about an hour.</p>
<p>In a larger bowl, I combined:</p>
<blockquote><p>
1 1/2 cups flour<br />
1/2 cup whole wheat flour (this can be regular flour.  I used whole wheat flour simply because I like it!)<br />
1 teaspoon salt<br />
1 teaspoon yeast<br />
1 cup of water<br />
day one's sponge
</p></blockquote>
<p>I mixed all of the dry ingredients together.  Then I chopped the sponge up into a dozen or so little pieces with a knife and mixed them into the dry ingredients.  Finally I added the water and mixed everything together, adjusting the flour or water until the dough formed a nice ball of dough that was soft and tacky but was not too sticky.</p>
<p>I poured the dough onto a floured surface and kneaded it for approximately 10 minutes.  Then I put the dough back into a greased bowl and allowed it to rise for approximately 90 minutes.  I then shaped the loaf and allowed it to rise for another 90 minutes.</p>
<p>(A note about these rise times: they are not exact. In reality, much was going on during the day, including a trip to the store and another trip to the playground, so no one was closely monitoring the clock. It seems to the uninitiated that making bread is a long and complicated process because the overall time it takes can be a day or more, but understand that it's really only about 20 minutes of work spread out over the entire day.  It is easy enough to accommodate if you are going to be near the house all day.)</p>
<p>I put an empty metal pan on the bottom shelf of the oven and preheated the oven to 500 degrees.    </p>
<p>When the oven was hot and the bread looked risen, I put the bread into the oven on the top shelf and  quickly pour a cup of hot water into the pan on the bottom shelf and closed the door.  After about 3-5 minutes, I reduced the temperature from 500 to 400 degrees, figuring that the loaf was done springing and would bake more evenly at a lower temperature.   I baked it for 20 minutes, then rotated the loaf and bake until done.  </p>
<p>This loaf took about 45 minutes, but time is dependent on the shape of the loaf.  I used an instant-read thermometer.  When the loaf hit 200 degrees inside, I pulled it out.</p>
<p><b>Aftermath</b><br />
<img src="http://www.thefreshloaf.com/up/20050116lesson3wsimpleloaf.jpg" width=400 height=300 /><br />
Comparing this loaf (on the right) to my bread from lesson one (on the left), I definitely noticed that this one had a nicer crust - it even crackled when I took it out of the oven and set it out to cool.  It seems to me that it had a richer flavor, which was in part the whole wheat flour and partially the longer, slower rises and overnight fermentation.</p>
<p>A criticism of both of these loaves is that, although they are decently raised,  neither one has the big irregular holes that you strive for in a rustic loaf.  I think there are a couple of reasons for this.  One likely reason is that I handle the loaves fairly roughly when shaping them: I suspect I am squeezing out too much of the air at that stage and rolling my loaves too tight.  I also suspect I am underhydrating my dough.  A moister, slacker dough should have an easier time forming large pockets.  Underkneading or baking before my dough is fully risen could also have been contributing factors.  As I have mentioned before, getting started baking is extremely easy, but mastering baking takes a lifetime.   One shouldn't be intimidated by this: the majority of your experiments still end up quite edible.  </p>

<p>That crust looks beautiful and gives me hope that one day I can master the crust for German brotchen (one of my ultimate bread dreams).</p>

    <p></p><p>This is the recipe I used. It didn't really turn out as I remembered them, partly because I was terrible at making crust until about 2 weeks ago and partly because there's a lot of regional variation in Brotchen..<br />
But it's worth a shot!</p>
<p>-Erin</p>
<p>2 1/2 - 3 cups flour</p>
<p>1 teaspoon sugar</p>
<p>1 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>1 package active dry yeast</p>
<p>1 tablespoon oil</p>
<p>1 cup warm water</p>
<p>1 egg white</p>
<p>Pour 2 1/2 cups flour into a large bowl and make a well. Pour yeast, sugar, and two tablespoons of warm water (the water comes from the 1 cup listed above) in the well. Mix yeast, sugar and water carefully within the well. Do not mix with the flour at this time. Cover the bowl with a cloth and set it in a warm place for 15 minutes. Add the remaining water and oil and beat until mixed.</p>
<p>Turn out on counter top and knead until smooth. Add the remaining 1/2 cup flour as needed. Put dough in a bowl, cover, and let it rise until double in size.</p>
<p>Punch down and divide the dough into 12 parts. Shape into oval rolls and place 3 inches apart on a greased and floured cookie sheet. Cover and let rise until double in size.</p>
<p>Beat egg white and 1 teaspoon water with a fork until frothy and brush on the rolls. Bake in a preheated oven at 450 for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown.</p>

    <p></p><p>Thanks for the Brotchen recipe. I'll have to try it by and by.</p>
<p>So far I've been baking variations of a simple French bread recipe in my rock oven. As this topic describes, it seems that technique (time and temp) is just as if not more critical than ingredients for mastering the art of baking. But as I learn the ropes I plan to try more complicated recipes. So far the simple French bread (with whole wheat and rye variations) have turned out so good that I have been quite satisfied. Reading this topic again, I think I'll add some kind of steam injection into my rock oven, altho the crust of my bread has been turning out nice and crunchy......</p>

<p>Thanks so much for the information and inspiration!  For my third loaf, baked last night, I wanted to try a weekday-friendly recipe, so after kneading and two risings of the basic recipe (plus some wheat flour), I shaped the dough and put it in the fridge for 24 hours.  The following evening, I baked it using your steam method and the loaf is wonderful.  Thanks!  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2410/2267099156_c2fafaa39d_b.jpg" title="Loaf #3" width="435" height="804" /></p>

    <p></p><p>Alton Brown used a large, unglazed terracotta dish that would go under a potted plant, instead of spending $40-$50 on a pizza stone or something similar.  In his episode of Good Eats that he did on bread (Dr. Strangeloaf), he just turned it upside-down, left it in while pre-heating and baked a round loaf on top of it.  It seems a much cheaper solution, and he knows his way around kitchen gadgets.  He has also used clay tiles and a masonry stone.</p>

  <h3><a href="/lessons/timeandtemperature#comment-50053" class="active">this is a hard lesson</a></h3>

  <div class="content">
    <p></p><p>I was stuck on lesson 2 for the longest time, because that bread was just so darn good. Now, I'm trying to challenge myself with lesson 3, and I'm not doing so hot here.</p>
<p>I've made this three times.</p>
<p>Time #1 - mixed the sponge exactly as directions state (but in my kitchenaid mixer). Boy was it sticky and goopy at first! It was easier to handle the next day, my bread rose nicely, but it spread out quite a bit and when I tried to reshape it, it just collapsed.</p>
<p>Time #2 - Again, any time I messed with the dough, it just collapsed. Still pretty sticky and goopy too. This time, I had added a little olive oil and sugar (1&nbsp;tsp. each), and tried cooking it on a stone. The bottom is really light in color. The bread turned out okay though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time #3 - Time #3 has been the weirdest. Haven't tasted this loaf yet. Kind of scared to. This time, I added lots of flour to the sponge because I tried kneading it by hand instead of with the mixer. It was pretty tough in the morning. But, when I added it to the 2nd day ingredients, it was still sticky and goopy, so I added more flour. The dough rose nicely in the bowl, I punched it down, then it was just a blobby mess. There was no way I was going to be able to just bake it on the stone; I was afraid I'd end up with a big honkin saltine cracker in the end. So, I put it in a bread pan to rise. It rose nicely, then collapsed when I put it in the oven.</p>
<p>Dang.</p>
<p>I'm thinking maybe I'll go back to lesson 2 bread for a while until my self esteem returns.</p>

<p>I made these delicious soft rolls today. Substituded the butter for extra virgin olive oil (3/4 cup of oil instead of 1 cup butter) and added less sugar too. I was delighted with the result: soft pillowy golden brown rolls, mmm. I also loved&nbsp;kneading the soft dough,very different to the eleasticy doughs I've been experimenting with so far.&nbsp;Tomorrow I'm going to try this recipe, number 3,&nbsp;as I have, till now, been unable to make a good crusty loaf. I started baking this christmas as my sister gave me an electric oven with a fan. No need to say Im hooked! Love your site, thanks.</p>

I am at a loss, can someone please help?&nbsp; Also, if it happens to me again and the bread deflates when I score it, should I just gather it again, reform the loaf and have a third rise with the reformed bread, and try scoring again (or not)?</p>
<p>ps: I was all excited when I picked up my bowl of the first rise of the second dough, and it made all kinds of noises when it deflated, it was alive, and smelled yeasty with promise.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p></p><p>As new as I am, I can answer your question, Lyne, from experience (very recent experience): your dough just over proofed while you were out shopping; and therefore the slash deflated it and there was no oven spring, and you had a yeasty smell. It just had nothing left to give.&nbsp; (The slash itself wasn't the problem; I find I can slash a good half inch when the dough is still in good shape). It seems the process always takes longer than I expect and I end up having to leave the house at critical times. Try refrigerating the dough when you need to slow down the rise. (It still rises though, so you don't want to be gone for too many hours).  I keep my camping cooler handy and dump some ice cubes in the bottom, since I don't have room in my fridge.&nbsp; Tonight I did just that when I knew the kids' bedtime rituals would take me away from monitoring the progress. I was able to slash and bake at just the right time for a change and the loaves turned out great.</p>

    <p></p><p>What a great website - I just found this after searching for information about my latest bread experiment. And I'm leaving a comment to see if anyone knows what has happened so I can repeat it.</p>
<p>I've been baking sandwich bread exclusively for the past few months (there are certian things a recession reminds you that you love) but am only feeding two people so I've been looking for ways to bake once and freeze either bread dough or par bake a loaf. I froze my dough after the first rise once before - thawed and baked and it turned out great. This time though...using the same recipe as before I let it rise once, shaped and put one loaf in the freezer and let the other rise a second time to bake that day. After a few hours I checked on the loaf in the freezer and it had continued to rise almost double in size!!! In the freezer! Thinking this was freezing thing was not going to work I pulled it out and decided to par-bake it. The first loaf had finished baking by this time and looked completely normal, tasted fine. I turned down the oven and put this next one in. While baking it rose VERY high. Once it reached 190 deg. but still pale I took it out, let it cool and put it in the freezer. Later after we had finished the first loaf (a couple days) I pulled the second loaf out of the freezer to thaw and baked/reheated it with pretty low expectations.</p>
<p>Well this loaf was...... FANTASTIC! The crust was crispy/yummy, the inside was chewy and the whole thing had a great flavor almost like french bread.</p>
<p>I want to repeat this but it was weird! So was it the long rise time in the freezer? That was my hunch and what brought me to this post. I'm going to let one of my loaves rise in the fridge today to experiment but if anyone has any ideas I'd be really interested to know.</p>

  <h3><a href="/lessons/timeandtemperature#comment-104747" class="active">Thank you Floyd</a></h3>

  <div class="content">
    <p></p><p>I finally came up with a resolution for the new year about 10 days into it.&nbsp; "Bake a good loaf of bread like my friend Bob (RIP)&nbsp;used to bring back with him from Brooklyn.&nbsp; Nice and crusty with a chewy moist center."</p>
<p>So I started on the internet looking for some direction as I have only ever baked biscuits before this.&nbsp; Within a few hours I found your website and found it to be a great place to start.&nbsp; So I began.&nbsp; I set a goal for myself to bake every weekend(mine happens to be Tues Wed) until I found the recipe I wanted and successfully&nbsp;executed it.&nbsp; My hope was&nbsp; that in 3 to 5 months I would be close to&nbsp;there.&nbsp; So I started with lesson 1 and it went great.&nbsp; Lesson 2 went smooth as pie too.&nbsp; I had bought one of Bobs Red Mills Bread kits in case I had trouble using my own ingredients.&nbsp; I didn't have any trouble but I used the kit(10 grain) anyway, very good loaf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I'm at lesson 3 and my 4th weekend.I'm thinking&nbsp;geezum crow&nbsp;is this dough wet, slack I guess is the term.&nbsp; But I struggled through it thinking it was part of the lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldnt keep the loafs from flattening out when I shaped them so I used pans for the first time.&nbsp; Disposable aluminum ones because I dont own any loaf pans yet.&nbsp; The dough rose nicely and baked up well.&nbsp; I had some larger holes and much closer the the crumb I was aspiring to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So week 5 came and I tried for a repeat of lesson 3 with some adjustments.&nbsp; One, I doubled it as none of the bread I had made in the past lasted more than a day or 2.&nbsp; Second I added a half cup of soaked Bobs Red Mill 10 grain cereal.&nbsp; I did the recipe exactly the same except when I shaped the loafs I really put some flour down on my surface so they wouldnt stick.&nbsp; I flattened them out a little and rolled them up and gave them a pinch.&nbsp; The generous flour helped them stay up for a short rising period.&nbsp; Then the mist spray and steam in the oven, bake for 30 minutes as I make a long slender loaf and voile'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I cant upload the pictures.&nbsp; They exceed the size limit.&nbsp; But it looks fantastic let me tell ya.</p>
<p>I couldnt be happier with the results.&nbsp; Its the bread I wanted.&nbsp; I cant believe it.&nbsp; Thank you Floyd.&nbsp; 95 percent of my instruction came from here and I am very appreciative.&nbsp; I actually made 2 batches this weekend and tried shaping some hoagie rolls as well.</p>
<p>Sincerely PatrickK</p>

    <p></p><p>I hope these came out ok.&nbsp; I had to reduce them to 15 % to get them to fit.&nbsp; Great job talking me through that though.  ty LOL I didnt use 10 grain with the top two loaves but did with the grinder rolls(more like mini loaves actually.  I could make them even smaller. I got six out of a double batch maybe next time I'll go for 8 or 10.&nbsp; </p>

    <p></p><p>I've been 'baking' since I was old enough to stand on a stool and help my mom make our bread when I was little. So, definitely not an inexperienced break maker, by any means. Anyway, I had/have been looking to improve, and happened to come across this forum a week or so. Wow, I am so glad I did! Awesome. Really. I've been having a blast reading and poking around. I decided to go through the lessons, using what I already know, and learning plenty more. The kids (7,4, and 2) just declared my version of Lesson 3 as the best bread ever. ;) Huzzah!!</p>

    <p></p><p>Sorry to hear that.</p>
<p>If it deflated just before going into the oven then perhaps it was over-risen. &nbsp;Cutting back the yeast a bit more or putting it into the oven a little bit earlier would hopefully fix the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Better luck next time!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm quite pleased with this one so far.. This is the 3rd attempt over the course of the week. &nbsp;The dough has since developed a very nice flavor--slightly sour with a light, chewy, moist texture.. &nbsp;The crust was also quite nice. &nbsp;The sesame was a last minute decision--turned out to be a good one. &nbsp;It wasn't too much and added a hint of sesame smell and flavor.. &nbsp;<span>I used semolina flour to dust the peel. &nbsp;The first attempt I used corn flour but it imparted too much corn flavor. &nbsp;On my second attempt I used bread flour which was a little better. &nbsp; The semolina was very neutral and worked out perfectly.</span></p>
<p>The recipe I used was a basic master boulle dough recipe:</p>
<p>6 cups of all purpose flour</p>
<p>1 tbsp dry active yeast</p>
<p>1 tbsp sea salt</p>
<p>2 cups of water</p>
<p>I pulled the dough out of the fridge and hand formed the three loaves in about a minute from dough batch. &nbsp;I let rest for about 20 minutes on the pizza peel dusted with semonlina flour while the oven warmed up to 450 F with the pizza stone. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Baked for exactly 30 minutes, with 1 cup of water thrown into a bottom boiler tray at start. &nbsp;I let the dough cool completely &nbsp;before I cut into it. The crust became slightly softened as the moisture escaped however the 6 "corners" were still crispy.&nbsp;</p>
