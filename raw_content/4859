			<h1>Cinnamon Roll Pancakes</h1>

			<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Updated 9/22/11 to Add:</strong></span>  If you&#8217;re coming here to sample these delicious Cinnamon Roll Pancakes, you just might like the latest recipe that I&#8217;ve posted for <a href="http://www.recipegirl.com/2011/09/22/pumpkin-cinnamon-roll-pancakes/">Pumpkin Cinnamon Roll Pancakes</a> too.  And <a href="http://www.recipegirl.com/2011/11/09/gingerbread-cinnamon-roll-pancakes/">Gingerbread- Cinnamon Roll Pancakes</a> too.  Enjoy!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever thought you needed a reason to eat pancakes, today is the day:  <em>National Pancake Day</em>.  Eat a short stack for breakfast, enjoy them for lunch, or make a dinner out a manhole-sized pancake&#8230; guilt free&#8230; because you&#8217;re merely celebrating their existence.  How do you like your pancakes? Buttermilk? Sweet Potato? Whole Grain? Fruit topped? Whipped Cream? I don&#8217;t usually care for any of that fancy stuff, but I can tell with absolute certainty that over-cooked, crusty pancakes have no place in my world. I like my pancakes fluffy. And sometimes I like slices of banana cooked inside. A good dose of real maple syrup is what I prefer to drizzle on top. But recently I started dreaming about mixing cinnamon rolls and pancakes together&#8230; and this is what I came up with- my new favorite pancake: <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Cinnamon Roll Pancakes</strong></span>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.recipegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Cinnamon-Roll-Pancakes-1.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I have a wonderfully fluffy pancake batter that I like to use (recipe below) so I swirled a bit of cinnamon roll filling into the pancake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.recipegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Cinnamon-Roll-Pancakes-3.jpg"></a></p>
<p>And they cooked up just like a pancake- fluffy, but with craters of crusty, sugary cinnamon swirled within.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.recipegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Cinnamon-Roll-Pancakes-4.jpg"></a></p>
<p>You might find three of these stacked in a fancy breakfast restaurant, but I&#8217;m gonna tell you that one pancake is all you need. It&#8217;s like eating a cinnamon roll, and no one needs more than one cinnamon roll for breakfast. Or certainly no more than two  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.recipegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Cinnamon-Roll-Pancakes-5.jpg"></a></p>
<p>See, just like a cinnamon roll. Love this. I can eat this pancake just as you see it, but you really need to add the glaze to get the full cinnamon roll-effect. Read on&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.recipegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Cinnamon-Roll-Pancakes-6.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Oh yeah. A warmed cream cheese glaze drizzled on top really completes this pancake. No syrup needed. Let me say that again: No. Syrup. Needed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.recipegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Cinnamon-Roll-Pancakes-9.jpg"></a></p>
<p>There you have it: <span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Cinnamon Roll Pancakes</strong></span>. With lots of ooey, gooey cream cheese glaze drizzled on top. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a pancake today. Go get &#8216;em. These babies are just like eating a cinnamon roll, which is a perfectly okay&#8230; once in a while, right?  I mean,  it&#8217;s not like I put chocolate chip cookie dough in them or anything.  Hmmmm.</p>

<h3 style="clear:left">Ingredients:</h3>
<div class="ingredient"><p><strong>PANCAKES:</strong><br />
<span class="ingredient"><span class="amount">1 cup</span> <span class="name">all-purpose flour</span></span><br />
<span class="ingredient"><span class="amount">2 teaspoons</span> <span class="name">baking powder</span></span><br />
<span class="ingredient"><span class="amount">1/2 teaspoon</span> <span class="name">salt</span></span><br />
<span class="ingredient"><span class="amount">1 cup</span> <span class="name">milk</span></span><br />

<span class="ingredient"><span class="amount">1 large</span> <span class="name">egg</span>, lightly beaten</span></p>
<p><strong>CINNAMON FILLING:</strong><br />
<span class="ingredient"><span class="amount">1/2 cup</span> <span class="name">butter</span>, melted</span><br />
<span class="ingredient"><span class="amount">3/4 cup</span> <span class="name">brown sugar</span>, packed</span><br />
<span class="ingredient"><span class="amount">1 Tablespoon</span> <span class="name">ground cinnamon</span></span></p>
<p><strong>CREAM CHEESE GLAZE:</strong><br />
<span class="ingredient"><span class="amount">4 Tablespoons</span> <span class="name">butter</span></span><br />
<span class="ingredient"><span class="amount">2 ounces</span> <span class="name">cream cheese</span></span><br />
<span class="ingredient"><span class="amount">3/4 cup</span> <span class="name">powdered sugar</span></span><br />
<span class="ingredient"><span class="amount">1/2 teaspoon</span> <span class="name">vanilla extract</span></span></p>
</div>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<div class="instructions"><p>1.  Prepare pancake batter:  In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt.  Whisk in milk, oil and egg, just until batter is moistened (a few small lumps are fine).</p>
<p>2.  In a medium bowl, mix butter, brown sugar and cinnamon.  Scoop the filling into a small zip baggie and set aside.  You don't want this to remain super-liquidy.  It's best if it becomes a consistency similar to  toothpaste.</p>
<p>3.  In a medium, microwave-safe bowl- heat butter and cream cheese until melted.  Whisk together until smooth; whisk in powdered sugar and vanilla extract; set aside.</p>
<p>4.  Heat large skillet over medium-low heat.  Spray with nonstick spray.  Scoop about 3/4 cup batter onto the skillet.  Snip the corner of your baggie of filling and squeeze a spiral of the filling onto the top of the pancake.  When bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more.  Transfer to a baking sheet or platter and keep in a warm oven until ready to serve.</p>
<p>5.  When ready to serve, spoon warmed glaze onto the top of each pancake.</p>
</div>

<h3>Tips:</h3>
<div class="extra"><p>*Keep the heat low or your pancakes might cook up too quickly.  Don't flip them until you see those bubbles starting to pop on top.  Flip them with a wide spatula so you can grasp the whole thing without batter and filling dripping all over the place!<br />
*It's best if you pour the batter onto your skillet, wait a minute or so and then swirl the cinnamon onto the batter.  That'll give it a chance to set a little before you add the swirl.<br />
*If your baggie of filling begins to get too thick, just pop it in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it up again.  On that same note, it shouldn't be too runny.  The consistency of soft toothpaste is perfect.  If it's melty and runny, it will tend to run all over your pancakes.  Once you micro it, let it sit on the counter at room temp for a while until it thickens slightly.</p>
<p>*I wrote a very detailed post on how to get the cinnamon filling *just right* on my <a href="http://www.recipegirl.com/2011/11/09/gingerbread-cinnamon-roll-pancakes/">Gingerbread- Cinnamon Roll Pancakes</a> Post.  Check it out before you attempt these!</p>
