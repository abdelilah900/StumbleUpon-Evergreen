<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Cold Turkey&#8221; </strong>describes the actions of a person who gives up a habit or addiction all at once — that is, rather than gradually easing the process through reduction or by using replacement medication.</p>
<p>A substance that is becoming increasingly addictive is <strong>food</strong>. We know this because <strong>obesity</strong> has become a growing concern among both genders and all age groups in the U.S.  In 1962, 13 percent of the American population was classified as obese. By 1994, this number had increased to 23 percent. According to 2007 estimates from the National Center for Health Statistics of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, over 60 percent of U.S. adult women are overweight with just over one-third of overweight adult women considered obese.(<a href="http://www.womenshealth.gov/faq/overweight-weight-loss.cfm">2</a>)</p>
<p>People are defined as overweight  (pre-obese) when their body mass index (BMI) is between 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and  30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>,  and obese when it is greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. BMI is defined as the individual&#8217;s body weight divided by  the square of his or her height.</p>
<h3>Obesity and Health</h3>
<p>There are links between obesity and more then 30 medical conditions including heart disease, diabetes and hypertension. Some 90,000 U.S. cancer deaths a year are linked to obesity. New evidence suggests the size of a cancerous prostate tumor is directly proportional to the  weight of the patient and the bigger the tumor the more aggressive the  cancer.</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>As the patients&#8217; body mass index increased, the tumor volume increased  synchronously,&#8221; said Dr Nilesh Patil, who led the six-year study at  Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan.</strong>(3)</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on our results, we believe having a larger percentage of tumor  volume may be contributing to the aggressive nature of the disease in  men with a higher BMI,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div>
<p>New evidence also suggests a link between higher BMI  and <strong>asthma</strong>. Writing in the medical journal <em>Allergy</em>, Dr Jun Ma of the Palo  Alto  Medical Research Institute in California found that the risk of   developing asthma more than tripled for the most obese individuals   compared with people whose weight was considered to be normal.(<a href="http://www.nursingtimes.net/whats-new-in-nursing/primary-care/asthma-linked-to-obesity/5015379.article?referrer=RSS">4</a>)</p>
<p>Although the reasons for the relationship are still largely unknown, some believe a resistance to insulin could also be a key factor.  The  study revealed that 37 percent of the obese group were either <strong>diabetic or  insulin</strong> resistant.</p>
</div>
<p>This could be a worrying link when, according to the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention, <strong>1 in 3 U.S children will become diabetic</strong> unless people start exercising more and eating less. Worldwide, diet-related afflictions such as heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes account for almost 60 percent of deaths annually.(<a href="http://www.zcommunications.org/the-obesity-epidemic-the-business-opportunities-in-obesity-by-yves-engler">5</a>)</p>
<h3>Obesity in Pregnancy</h3>
<p>Another concern for children is that <strong>one-fifth of  pregnant women in the U.S. is obese</strong>.</p>
<p>Whatever a mother eats, drinks or  consumes while pregnant goes directly  through the  bloodstream into the  placenta.</p>
<p><a href="http://arch1design.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Placenta1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8081" title="Placenta" src="http://arch1design.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Placenta1.jpg" alt="Placenta1  Cold Turkey, Obesity and Sterilization" width="250" height="188" /></a>The placenta is an organ  that connects the developing fetus to the  uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake, waste elimination and gas  exchange via the mother&#8217;s blood supply.  If you are pregnant and take a drink &#8212; a glass of wine, a  beer or a cocktail &#8212; your unborn child takes the same drink.</p>
<p>Babies born to <strong>obese mothers</strong> are at increased risk of suffering dangerous neural tube defects during development. <strong>Neural tube defects</strong> (NTDs) are one of the most common birth defects, occurring in approximately one in 1,000 live births in the U.S.</p>
<p>Two examples of  NTDs are <strong>anencephaly</strong> and <strong>spina bifida.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anencephaly</strong> (without brain) is a neural tube defect that occurs when the head end of the neural tube fails to close, usually during the 23rd and 26th days of pregnancy, resulting in an absence of a major portion of the brain and skull. Infants born with this condition are usually blind, deaf and unconscious. The lack of a functioning cerebrum will ensure that the infant will never gain consciousness. Infants are either stillborn or usually die within a few hours or days after birth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spina bifida</strong> is a developmental birth defect caused by the incomplete closure of the embryonic neural tube. Some vertebrae overlying the spinal cord are not fully formed and remain unfused and open. This results in walking problems, loss of sensation, deformities of the hips, knees or feet and loss of muscle tone. Depending on location, intense pain may occur originating in the lower back, and continuing down the leg to the back of the knee.</li>
</ul>
<p>A paper in the Journal of the American Medical  Association which pooled and analyzed dozens of earlier studies, found that the risk of  <strong>spina bifida was 2.2 times higher for babies of obese mothers</strong> compared  to infants of normal weight women, while the risk of other neural tube  defects was 1.8 times higher. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/health/13obesity.html?_r=1">6</a>)</p>
<p>“Our findings confirm what studies have been finding with regard to  neural tube defects, particularly spina bifida, and some heart  anomalies,” Judith Rankin, senior author of the study and a researcher  at the Institute of Health and Society at Newcastle University in the  United Kingdom, said in an e-mail message.</p>
<p><strong>“However, we were surprised  at the range of birth defects that were found to have an increased risk  in mothers who were obese.”</strong></p>
<p>Studies also show that babies who are born to obese mothers are more likely to suffer from obesity by the time they reach the age of four. In one recent study, 29 percent of children born to obese mothers were also obese by the age of four, compared with only 9 percent of babies born to mothers of normal weight.(<a href="http://www.pregnancy-info.net/obesity_pregnancy.html">7</a>)</p>
<p>There is evidence the child&#8217;s body-weight-regulating mechanisms might be permanently altered by maternal signals associated with the mother&#8217;s own overweight. According to ongoing studies by Agricultural Research Service (ARS)-funded investigator Kartik Shankar and colleagues, such maternal programming of the unborn child could increase the risk that the child would become an overweight or obese adult and would have a higher risk of obesity-related afflictions.</p>
<p>Shankar looked at weight gains among rat pups whose dads were lean and whose mothers, called &#8220;dams,&#8221; were either lean or overweight (from overfeeding) before conception and throughout pregnancy.</p>
<p>All offspring were of normal weight at birth and at weaning. However, when the weaned offspring were given free access to an unlimited amount of high-fat rations, the offspring of overweight dams showed remarkable sensitivity to the high-fat rations. They gained significantly more weight, and more of that weight as fat mass, than did the offspring of lean dams.(<a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/mar10/baby0310.htm">8</a>)</p>
<p>The study strongly suggests that exposure to the mother&#8217;s obesity while in the womb results in programming of the offspring&#8217;s metabolism and body-weight-control mechanisms. The dams&#8217; obesity alone was sufficient to significantly increase the pups&#8217; susceptibility to obesity.</p>
<h3><a href="http://arch1design.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/obese-woman1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8172" title="obese woman" src="http://arch1design.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/obese-woman1-215x300.jpg" alt="obese woman1 215x300  Cold Turkey, Obesity and Sterilization" width="215" height="300" /></a>Food Addiction</h3>
<p>Obesity has long been blamed on weak willpower, overeating, genetics and lack of exercise. Now scientists are seeing signs that suggest there may be an additional contributor: <strong>food addiction</strong>.</p>
<p>Food addiction is a contemporary term used to describe a pathological disorder; the compulsive, excessive craving for, and consumption of, food. When any substance is taken into the body regardless of its potential for harm or in excess of need, that substance is said to be abused. Individuals who abuse substances in such a way are addicts; these persons become physiologically and mentally dependent upon certain substances, in this case food. (<a href="http://www.allaboutlifechallenges.org/food-addiction.htm">9</a>)</p>
<p>Psychiatrist Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse says for some compulsive eaters, the drive to eat is so intense that it overshadows the motivation to engage in other rewarding activities, and it becomes difficult to exercise self-control. This is similar to the compulsion that an addict feels to take drugs, she says.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;When this occurs, the compulsive eating behavior can interfere with their well-being and their health.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h3>Cocaine</h3>
<p>Babies born to mothers who use cocaine throughout their pregnancy may also have a smaller head and have their growth hindered. Babies who are exposed to cocaine later in pregnancy may be born dependent and suffer from withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, sleeplessness, muscle spasms, and feeding difficulties. Some experts believe that learning difficulties may result as the child gets older. Defects of the genitals, kidneys, and brain are also possible.</p>
<h3>Heroin</h3>
<p>Babies can also be born addicted to heroin and can suffer from withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms include irritability, convulsions, diarrhea, fever, sleep abnormalities, and joint stiffness. Mothers who inject narcotics are more susceptible to HIV, which can be passed to their unborn children.</p>
<h3>Marijuana</h3>
<p>Studies of marijuana in pregnancy are inconclusive because many women    who smoke marijuana also use tobacco and alcohol. Marijuana, like    cigarette smoke, contains toxins that keep the baby from getting the    proper supply of oxygen that he or she needs to grow.</p>
<p><strong>What about food?</strong></p>
<p>All commercial foods in the U.S. now have pesticides and herbicides in  them. <strong> Aldehydes</strong> are used in some foods as flavoring and, when coupled  with <strong>formaldehyde</strong> used as preservatives in others, can trigger reactions  of the gynecological  system. Many heavy metals like <strong>lead, cadmium and  mercury</strong> may  be found in foods. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>If these are ingested in large quantities  or repetitively, problems can arise.</strong></p>
<p>Childhood mental problems, lack of brain development, still births and   childbirth defects, including spina bifida, were linked to lead fallout   from the Port Kembla, Australia copper smelter, steelworks and  industrial complex.(<a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/mar2000/lead-m02.shtml">10</a>)</p>
<p>A meta-analysis by  <a href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/9/2/139.full">Schwartz and</a> <a href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/9/2/139.full">Reis</a> (2000) suggests that individuals with increased                      exposure to cadmium have an increased risk of  pancreatic cancer. In 1993, the <a href="http://www.iarc.fr/"><em>International Agency for Research on Cancer</em> </a>classified cadmium and cadmium compounds as known                      human carcinogens.</p>
<p>Schwartz and Reis conclude persons with diets high in                      cadmium-containing foods, such as <strong>seafood, root  vegetables, and breads                      and pastries</strong>, should be at increased risk from carcinogenic effect.</p>
<h3>Junk Foods</h3>
<p>Coal tar is highly  carcinogenic.  All artificial colors, flavors, and odors are made from coal tar. They are found in all soft drinks, cosmetics, and many medicines. Foods which have bright colors, strong flavors, or odors often have coal tar  in them. The more natural  and unprocessed the food is, the less likely it is to have additives. Junk  foods are the worst.(<a href="http://www.drgrisanti.com/food_toxins.htm">11</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://arch1design.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/junk-food.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8171" title="junk food" src="http://arch1design.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/junk-food-279x300.jpg" alt="junk food 279x300  Cold Turkey, Obesity and Sterilization" width="279" height="300" /></a> Junk foods are typically ready to eat convenience foods containing  high levels of saturated fats, salt, or sugar; and  little or no fruit,  vegetables,  or dietary fiber.  Junk food includes foods such as <strong>hamburgers,  hot dogs,  chocolate,  ice  cream, cake,  French fries and pizza</strong>.</p>
<p>A study by Paul Johnson and Paul Kenny at The Scripps Research Institute  suggested that junk food alters brain activity in a manner similar to  addictive drugs like <strong>cocaine or heroin</strong>. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_food">12</a>)</p>
<p><strong>How do we put a stop to substance addiction during pregnancy and its consequences on the health of babies and children?</strong></p>
<p>Currently there is only one state, South Carolina, that holds prenatal substance abuse as a criminal act of child abuse and neglect. Other states have laws that address prenatal substance abuse.</p>
<p>Some states have policies that enforce admission to an inpatient  treatment program for pregnant women who use drugs. These states  include Minnesota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Under current promotion are the ideals of <a href="http://www.projectprevention.org/">Project Prevention</a> which offers cash incentives to women that are addicted to drugs and/or alcohol to use long-term or permanent birth control. Project Prevention supports drug treatment and believes all addicts should have the opportunity to seek and find it. They say:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Since we all know there is a lack of drug treatment available to addicts at times I think we can all agree that being on birth control unless/until they have the opportunity to get clean is a positive step for all addicts/alcoholics.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Project Prevention states its objective is <strong>&#8220;to reduce the burden of  this social problem on taxpayers&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>Since it was founded in 1994, the charity has paid 3,388 people in the U.S. to be sterilized or to take long-term contraception measures. Of these, 1,059 have chosen Depo-Provera, a long-term injectable contraceptive; 1,260 chose tubal ligation – sterilization – while the remainder have opted for coils or implants. Just under 50 men have had vasectomies. In the US, addicts are offered up to $300 (£200) for sterilization.</p>
<p><strong>The answer for obesity, food addiction and the dangers to the unborn child</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>Make the companies who are responsible for putting toxins in our food accountable, for starters&#8230;and for the main course?</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps obese expectant mothers, who are consuming excessive amounts of these toxins, should try some &#8216;Cold Turkey&#8217;&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

	                	<p>Totally agree with you&#8211; this is a wonderful explanation and warning.   Not surprised to know that junk food alters the brain like a drug&#8211; wonder too about the crazy increase in autism over the last two decades &#8212; might it not be traced to environmental pollution, including heavy metals etc. in our food?  Lots of food for thought here.  Good stuff!!</p>

	                	<p>I just can not fathom what possesses someone that is addicted to a substance that they know will cause long term damage to a baby to have a baby. If you want to hurt your own body, that is your business, but when an innocent baby is involved&#8230;..it should be criminal. While I hate the idea of giving people money to buy more drugs and alcohol with, it is much better than seeing these helpless fetuses  suffer from the effects of drugs and alcohol</p>

	                	<p>I&#8217;ve spoken to many people -including alcoholics and addicts &#8211; who have zero tolerance for the plight of those addicted to food. It&#8217;s a modern manifestation of an age old &#8216;habit&#8217;: blame those who suffer for their plight and stigmatise them too. It&#8217;s the mindset of the Victorian middle and upper-classes regarding the poor. Sometimes i think we let our need for a scapegoat overshadow sense.</p>
<p>Addiction to food, sex, shopping etc&#8230;.can be as harmful as a substance addiction. The same cortical structures are activated in all addiction, leading to entrenched pathways and distorted cognition. And money must be begged, borrowed or stolen to fund all behaviours.</p>
<p>I love a little junk food every now and again. However, I know some sweets make me crazy and if i eat pringles I&#8217;m wired and unable to sleep &#8211; which I find a tad unnerving!</p>
