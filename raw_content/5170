            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">People over 35 should be dead.
            Here's why. According to today's regulators and bureaucrats,
            those of us who were kids in the 40's, 50's, 60's, or even maybe
            the early 70's probably shouldn't have survived.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our baby cribs were covered with
            bright colored lead-based paint. We had no childproof lids on
            medicine bottles, doors or cabinets, and when we rode our bikes,
            we had no helmets. (Not to mention the risks we took hitchhiking.)</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">As children, we would ride in
            cars with no seat belts or air bags. Riding in the back of a
            pickup truck on a warm day was always a special treat!</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We drank water from the garden
            hose and not from a bottle. Horrors! We ate cupcakes, bread and
            butter, and drank soda pop with sugar in it, but we were never
            overweight because we were always outside playing. We shared
            one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle, and no one
            actually died from this.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We would spend hours building
            our go-carts out of scraps and then rode down the hill, only
            to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes
            a few times, we learned to solve the problem.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We would leave home in the morning
            and play all day, as long as we were back when the street lights
            came on.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">No one was able to reach us all
            day. NO CELL PHONES!!!!! Unthinkable!</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We did not have Play-stations,
            Nintendo 64, X-Boxes, no video games at all, no 99 channels on
            cable, video tape movies, surround sound, personal cell phones,
            personal computers, or Internet chat rooms.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We had friends! We went outside
            and found them. We played dodge ball, and sometimes, the ball
            would really hurt.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We fell out of trees, got cut
            and broke bones and teeth, and there were no lawsuits from these
            accidents. They were accidents. No one was to blame but us. Remember
            accidents?</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We had fights and punched each
            other and got black and blue and learned to get over it.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We made up games with sticks
            and tennis balls and ate worms, and although we were told it
            would happen, we did not put out very many eyes, nor did the
            worms live inside us forever.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">We rode bikes or walked to a
            friend's home and knocked on the door, or rang the bell or just
            walked in and talked to them!</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Little League had tryouts and
            not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to
            deal with disappointment.<BR>
            Some students weren't as smart as others, so they failed a grade
            and were held back to repeat the same grade.<BR>
            Horrors! Tests were not adjusted for any reason.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Our actions were our own. Consequences
            were expected. The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke
            a law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law. Imagine
            that!</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This generation has produced
            some of the best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors,
            ever. The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation
            and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility,
            and we learned how to deal with it all.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">And you're one of them!</FONT></P>
