				<!--<div class="bylineData">Published: March 19, 2009</div>-->
				<br />Clay has been used for thousands of years by the Egyptians, Mayans, and the Native American Indians. Clay is a dynamic presence--a catalyst rather than an agent itself. This is possible because clay is alive. Most of the poisons in the body are positively charged, whereas clay has a negative electrical attraction. Thus, these toxins cannot resist being drawn toward the clay. Clay is renowned to have many uses in promoting health in plants, animals and humans. Bentonite, Montmorillonite, Pascalite, as well as other types of healing clays, have been used by indigenous cultures since before recorded history. In fact, the use of volcanic ashes internally is almost older than civilization itself.		</div>
