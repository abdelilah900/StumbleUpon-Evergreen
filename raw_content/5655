Abruptly, and likely surprising nobody more than my husband, I have decided to be a Good Football Wife this year. Finding it impossible to summon any actual enthusiasm for the game but refusing to fulfill the sitcom wife-clich&#233; of grumbling about my husband&#8217;s Sunday afternoon routines, in the past, I&#8217;ve mostly tolerated it. But with months of cold and/or wet Sundays ahead of us, I finally came to the realization that football season is the perfect excuse to embrace some much-needed Lazy Sundays. A morning bagel, park and farmer&#8217;s market run routine segues nicely into an afternoon of bumming around, or you know, however the person at hand defines it. For Alex, football, with the requisite pre- and post-game Sports Shouting episodes. For Jacob, removing books from the bookcases one by one, then attempting to stand on them to reach higher shelves, so he can remove them too. He naps, we replace the books, he wakes up and starts again. Ah, Sundays.</p>

<p>I made a giant pot of beef chili that I found from an old (like, 20 years!) Gourmet magazine, which, like almost all Gourmet recipes I run across, makes me sniffle and miss the magazine (in its original incarnation, that is, I haven&#8217;t made sense of this app thing yet) even more. Here, they gathered all of the things you&#8217;d normally dollop on top of a bowl of chili &#8212; cheddar, sour cream and pickled jalape&#241;os &#8212; and formed them into a biscuit, which they use to serve the chili shortcake-style. I bet you didn&#8217;t know chili could be so cute! I just want to stand up and applaud their creativity but instead I&#8217;m very sad, because I&#8217;ve been bereft of fresh batches of it for nearly a year. I did not cry into this chili, however, because it was awesome, so awesome that the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5030119719/in/photostream/">member of our family</a> who a) does not know how to use a spoon, b) wants to eat what you&#8217;re eating but c) refuses to be fed from a spoon actually honored us with the privilege of letting us feed him. And tucked away a <i>frightening</i> amount of chili. The chili is that tremendous.</p>

<p><span id="more-6789"></span></p>
<p>One last thing: If you are from Texas, I want you to promise to take a deep breath before reading the recipe. I know that chili con carne is the official dish of Texas and I know how seriously Texans take their chili con carne and their feelings about things named chili that contain things like kidney beans, bell peppers, carrots, oregano, vinegar and if that hasn&#8217;t blown your top yet, <i>tomato sauce too</i> &#8212; see also: Epicurious comments such as &#8220;No TEXAN would ever call this chili!&#8221; and &#8220;This recipe is blasphemous!&#8221; Then again, if you are from Texas you&#8217;ve likely got a recipe you were making since you were old enough to stand at a stove and don&#8217;t need my Chili Con Carne Not Sanctioned By Texans or Those With Texas Allegiances anyway. But still, I want us all to get along, even those of us who (shh) might like it all blasphemized better.</p>

<p><strong>A not-so-new sideblog about feeding babies:</strong> I have this terrible habit of launching side projects and, um, not telling people &#8212; like the <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/blogs/editor/deb-perelman/">six weeks I was blogging at Epicurious</a> or <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/tips/">the side blog entirely devoted to cooking Tips</a>.

<p><b>Beef Chili with Sour Cream and Cheddar Biscuits</b><br />
Adapted from <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chili-con-Carne-with-Chili-Cheddar-Shortcakes-10299">Gourmet</a></p>
<p>A couple notes: First, if you like a saucier chili, you might reduce the beef by one pound, though this might reduce your serving size. Second, I didn&#8217;t get the rise out of these biscuits that I&#8217;d expected to. Since they were delicious and other commenters have raved about them, I assumed it was me and didn&#8217;t bother tinkering with them. Finally, the original recipe says that it serves six but I think it stretches further, especially if you&#8217;re doing this shortcake-style, with just a ladleful on top. I&#8217;d suggest scaling the biscuit portion to the number of guests you&#8217;re having. If you make more than you need, I recommend freezing the extras unbaked until you&#8217;re ready to serve the chili again &#8212; you can bake them directly from the freezer, and they&#8217;ll always be fresh and crisp.</p>
<p>Serves 6</p>
<p>2 large onions, chopped (about 3 cups)<br />
1/4 cup vegetable oil<br />
1 tablespoon minced garlic<br />
2 carrots, sliced thin (suggested by Gourmet) or in a small dice, as I&#8217;d chop them next time<br />
3 pounds boneless beef chuck, ground coarse or 3 pounds ground beef<br />
1/4 cup chili powder<br />
1 tablespoon ground cumin<br />
2 tablespoons paprika<br />
1 tablespoon crumbled dry oregano<br />
Dried red pepper flakes, to taste (Gourmet suggests 1 tablespoon; I used 1 teaspoon knowing that my flakes are very hot)<br />
2 8-ounce cans tomato sauce or 2 cups fresh tomato sauce or tomato puree<br />
1 1/4 cups beef broth<br />
3 tablespoons cider vinegar<br />
1 3/4 cups or 1 19-ounce can kidney beans, rinsed and drained<br />
2 green bell peppers, chopped<br />
Sour Cream and Cheddar Biscuits, below<br />
Sour cream and pickled jalape&#241;os (optional, to finish)</p>
<p>In a large pot (I used a 5-quart, and <i>just</i> fit it all), heat the oil over moderately low heat and cook the onions in it for 5 to 10 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic and carrots and cook for one minute more. Raise the heat to medium and add the beef, stirring and breaking up any lumps until it is no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano and pepper flakes and cook for another minute. Add the tomato sauce, broth and vinegar and simmer the chili, covered, for 35 to 40 minutes (if you used ground beef) or 50 to 60 minutes (if you used coarse chuck). Add the kidney beans, bell peppers, salt (I used 2 teaspoons to get the seasoning right for my tastes) and pepper to taste and simmer for an additional 15 minutes, until the bell peppers are tender.</p>
<p>Serve ladled over a split Sour Cream and Cheddar Biscuit, below, with additional sour cream and pickled jalapenos, if desired.</p>
<p><b>Sour Cream and Cheddar Biscuits</b><br />
Adapted from <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chili-con-Carne-with-Chili-Cheddar-Shortcakes-10299">Gourmet</a></p>
<p>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br />
2 teaspoons baking powder<br />
1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />
1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into bits<br />
1/4 pound sharp Cheddar cheese, coarsely grated (about 1 1/2 cups)<br />
Drained and chopped pickled jalape&#241;os, to taste (I used about 2 tablespoons)<br />
1 cup sour cream</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 425&#176;F. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Either cut the butter pieces into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or rub them in with your fingertips until well-combined. Stir in the cheddar, jalape&#241;os and sour cream until the mixture forms a sticky dough. Pat it out to a 1/2-inch thickness on a very well-floured counter and use a 3 1/2-inch biscuit cutter to cut six rounds. Bake on an ungreased (or parchment-lined, if your baking sheets are as &#8220;weathered&#8221; as mine are) for 15 to 17 minutes, until golden on top.</p>
<p><u>Do ahead:</u> If you&#8217;d like to serve them over a couple days, I recommend freezing already formed but unbaked biscuits until you are ready to bake them &#8212; you can bake them directly from the freezer, adding just a minute or two to the baking time.</p>

				<p>I feel so validated: this is how I make chili too and I&#8217;ve never set foot in the U.S, much less the south (though I long to &#8211; po&#8217;boys! beignets!). If you and Gourmet say so, it must be right.</p>

				<p>I have to say I love the blasphemous chili much more than the Texan variety.  Just don&#8217;t tell that to my 4 or 5 or 15 in-laws that reside in Texas, will you?  I don&#8217;t want to be thrown out of the family just yet. </p>
<p>On the biscuit side, I have to say, delicious.  And the side projects, I have a very hard time keeping up with myself, much less sharing all of that with other people as I balance everything and try not to break too many dishes in the process, so I can definitely relate.  I have been enjoying the tips, the baby site and your Epicurious ramblings, and I always look forward to what you cook up here.  Thanks for being so incredibly inspiring.</p>

				<p>This Gourmet recipe is the basis of my go-to chili recipe too! For a half batch, I use 1 lb of ground beef, add a can of diced tomatoes and another (small one) of tomato paste, keep the carrots and peppers at full strength (i.e., not halved), and add a small handful of cocoa nibs or 1 oz of unsweetened chocolate. Just made it last week in fact&#8230;yum.</p>

				<p>I know this might be a crazy idea, but is there anything that can substitute the tomato sauce or tomato puree? I am allergic to tomatoes and often have to skip over these super yummy sounding recipes and have always wondered if there was a substitute.<br />

				<p>Texan born and raised here (although currently living elsewhere).  Hook&#8217;em Horns and all that. And I put beans AND tomato paste in my chili.  I know it&#8217;s sacrilege, but it makes damn good chili! However I draw the line at carrots.  I want chili, not ground beef stew!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m from Texas, and my dad&#8217;s (delicious) chili is quite similar to yours (he adds potatoes to the blasphemy).  It&#8217;s always better to embrace diversity in all its delicious forms &#8212; culinary or otherwise, right? ;-) </p>

				<p>Deb, this is exactly how I feel! I&#8217;m not much of a football fan &#8211; although I have started to appreciate it more since I started playing roller derby, since a lot of the concepts are the same (derby is way cooler, IMHO). And it&#8217;s difficult for me when the weather is really nice and my boyfriend wants to watch his beloved Atlanta Falcons. But! If you can&#8217;t beat&#8217;em, join&#8217;em, right? It&#8217;s a great excuse to cook and clean and tackle house projects. Thanks for your great site, it&#8217;s one of my favorites!</p>

The King Arthur directions are good, but sort of confusing: less leavening agent, more dry *and* more wet ingredients, etc.  Specific tips for this recipe would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>Life and kitchen &#8212; Babies all over the world eat spicy food. That said, I am sure some bellies are more sensitive than others. Only way to find out is to offer a range of foods, see what they like.</p>

				<p>deb, a general but still related question -</p>
<p>whenever you say parchment lined, is it okay to use foil instead? the sheets i use belonged to my mother (and probably her mother as well) so i need to cover them with something, but whenever i use parchment i get panicked it&#8217;s going to set fire in the oven. there&#8217;s always much smoking and odd spots and, who knows why. (and yes, i&#8217;m not mistakenly using wax paper or a brown bag or something :p)</p>

				<p>OH I&#8217;m a fan of football sort of &#8211; when my husband is not screaming like a banchy &#8211; because I love being in on Sundays lazying around myself!  I need downtime before a busy work week!  But lemme tell you, I went to the stadium a few weeks ago for my first TAILGATE extravaganza and lemme tell ya &#8211; it was THE BEST!  My husband and son have been raving for the 10+ years they&#8217;ve been going and well I had my first taste and I&#8217;m thinking &#8211; hmmm maybe I&#8217;ll just take the train and tailgate and hop on the train home when all the men go in for the game.  IT WAS THAT GOOD!  Seriously!</p>

				<p>oh boy oh boy &#8211; it is definitely getting close to time for chili! i was toying with a pulled pork recipe for this weekend&#8217;s bears game, but maybe chili instead? of course, it most certainly does <i>not</i> have anything whatsoever to do with the biscuits (wink..).</p>

				<p>My husband and I were having a &#8220;which is better to watch&#8221; argument about baseball vs football, with him being solidly in the baseball camp. I pointed out that there are a myriad of snacks associated with football, all fattening and delicious. All baseball has going for it is a hot dog and a handfull of peanuts. He had to concide me that point.</p>

				<p>Brilliant idea, biscuits are not really served here in NZ, we call them scones, and have them with jam &amp; cream, but I tried them with sausage gravy on a trip to the US a few years ago, (thanks goodness it was a short holiday or I would have left the size of a house!) and fell in love:) Makes a fab change from rice, I guess you could use buttermilk instead of sour cream?</p>

				<p>Chili has been on my list of things to make for some time. This looks like a good friendly recipe for those who have never made chili con carne. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited about your participation in Epicurious and learning about how you are introducing new foods to your baby. One thing is for sure Jacob is certainly going to be exposed to a large variety of good foods.</p>

				<p>We&#8217;re making chili tonight&#8230;the weather in NYC today actually demands chili for dinner!  Your recipe came at a most appropriate time!  Yours is actually a variation on my go-to chili recipe.  I love beans in my chili &#8211; helps a lot with upping the fiber content, and makes it go a LOT further.  I generally use red beans or black beans and cannelini beans.  I also use red, yellow and green bell peppers.  The great thing about chili is that it is an easy that is SO easy to customize to whatever you have in your fridge and/or pantry.<br />
I&#8217;m gluten-intolerant, but I&#8217;m sure that your sour cream biscuits are TO DIE FOR!</p>
<p>I agree with your earlier poster about allowing your baby to try spicier foods.  We basically only gave our baby bland foods until our pediatrician told us when our son was 7 months old to try seasoned foods&#8230;basically saying that if we were living in India, he&#8217;d already be eating curries at 6 months old, so to try spicier foods because babies have a very acute appreciation for seasonings.  At 2, our son LOVES hummus, artichokes, most spices, is obsessed with lox, tuna fish, loves garlic and pepper in his wheels and broccoli, and has already tried sushi!  A little trick also &#8211; frozen broccoli florets cook in the same amount of time as pasta in boiling water&#8230;so if you throw in dry pasta, add some frozen broccoli to to the boiling water&#8230;it gets very soft, so it is easy for a baby to eat, and is a super-easy way to make sure that a baby is eating veggies!</p>

				<p>This looks delish!  I know the beef adds a lot of depth to the chili, but I could see a smokey vegetarian chili being wonderful and a little lighter.  (Don&#8217;t tell Texas I put the words vegetarian and chili next to each other.)</p>

				<p>I love football.  And I do love making chili- but I think I may have to skip the carrots&#8230;..as it seems sacriligious somehow and my boys (big and small) each claim to only dislike one food on the planet: cooked carrots.  We always eat it with corn chips and cheese, but the biscuit idea is awesome!!!!</p>
<p>ps&#8211;watching football is always a nice opportunity to surreptitiously ogle the man bodies all over the field &#8230;.maybe that will help.</p>

				<p>Six servings?  So they expect each person to eat half a pound of beef, plus all the other stuff in that chili, plus a biscuit?  </p>
<p>Crabbiness aside, you&#8217;re right that that&#8217;s a very cute serving suggestion for chili.</p>

				<p>Bridget &#8212; I say in the recipe notes that I believe this will serve more people. I don&#8217;t think the three of us got through a quarter of it last night (though, possibly, the baby doesn&#8217;t count as a full serving).</p>
<p>Christine &#8212; Now, not to be stuck on a technicality, but how can you see them under all that armor? </p>
<p>Anyway, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve embraced football per se. I don&#8217;t think I even saw a minute of the Giants losing yesterday, but I embrace the <i>culture</i> around it: comforting hearty meals and lazy Sundays. Who can hate that?</p>

				<p>Mmmmm.  Summer just broke here over the weekend and I broke the crockpot out of the closet.  I&#8217;ll probably use 1 carrot (and shred it) and add a teaspoon of cocoa powder, but this looks just about perfect.  Of course, since I live alone, the football won&#8217;t exist, the chili and biscuits and accoutrements will go to work with me on Monday.  &#8230;at which time I will ban all of my guys from being in my office for the rest of the day.  Just sayin&#8217;&#8230;.Body Shop&#8230;guys&#8230;.chili&#8230;.</p>

				<p>This is not on the topic of chili, but I&#8217;ve wanted to ask for a while&#8230;. would you consider changing your link color in the articles? I like seeing the photos and whatnot that you link to but I find myself scanning the text with my mouse until it turns to a hand because I can&#8217;t see the links at all. As a designer I appreciate how nice the non-underlined gray looks on the sidebar but within the text it&#8217;s, for all intents and purposes, invisible. Just something to ponder that may not bother anyone but me!</p>

				<p>Born and raised Texan, present!  Nowadays, I&#8217;ll put anything BUT meat in my chili as I&#8217;ve gone vegetarian (we&#8217;re not all meat-eaters here!).  That said, when I did eat meat, I made it most often with ground turkey and beans, so I&#8217;m not conventional.  However, I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of kidney beans in chili&#8230;I used pinto with meat, and now use black on their own, but that&#8217;s just a personal preference.  :)  Those biscuits sound fantastic!!</p>

				<p>I understand it when people want to be purists about their cooking.  I really do.  I believe in saying things like &#8220;Mexican-inspired chocolate cake&#8221; (when one adds cinnamon and powdered chilis to said recipe, for instance) instead of &#8220;Mexican chocolate cake&#8221;.  However, when people do things like insist that REAL chili cannot have BEANS and then have no logical reason to back it up &#8212; that kills me.  I believe that tradition is useful and gives us an educational base, but I also believe in branching out. Yes, I can be cranky about these things&#8230;!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again, Deb: I wish you didn&#8217;t have to ward off these sorts of arguments, but I adnmire your skill at doing so.</p>
<p>This recipe looks lovely, and it hits on one of my favorite comfort foods: soup served over bread. Each compliments the other, and it warms the hand holding the bowl in a most satisfying way.</p>

				<p>Fabulous chili and photos, Deb! I was a little shocked by the sliced carrots, though. I have never seen carrots in chili, but my guess is that it adds a little sweetness? Anyway, this looks like the perfect Sunday football recipe (I love Sundays and football-although mostly for the food and atmosphere)!</p>

<p>I can *so* relate to the book-pulling and wants-to-eat-what-you-eat-but-won&#8217;t-let-you-feed-him stories! Our almost-one-year old is exactly the same. </p>
<p>For those who asked, I&#8217;ve used ground turkey in chili before and it&#8217;s great! Vegetarians could probably also try the veggie-ground-round, but you don&#8217;t need to cook it &#8212; you just add it in a bit later.</p>

				<p>For more rise on your biscuits, consider: cutting the butter into chunks, then freezing it overnight (or alternatively, risk chopping frozen butter&#8230;always an adventure in kitchen drama).  The juicey jalapenos are also affecting your rise&#8230;try mixing the dough, keeping it in the bowl&#8230;and chilingl the whole mass for an hour or two.  Then, dump the dough out onto your counter, and gently fold like a business letter (i.e. laminated dough style).  Make a few quarter-turns&#8230;and if desired chill again.  OR cut and bake.  It&#8217;s best if the oven is hotter than 425F&#8230;I suggest 500F when the biscuits first go in.  Place on top rack of oven. After 5 minutes, turn oven temperature down to 450F.  Also, it is good to move biscuits to bottom rack for last minutes of baking.</p>

I hadn&#8217;t been inspired to do anything more than a quick sandwich or a poached egg <i>tops</i> until I saw this recipe after I came home today.  I knew I had to make exactly this, and it ended up being the most perfect and delicious end to this soggy day.

				<p>My husband&#8217;s grandmother died last October. While we were doing funeral preparations, we found out Gourmet got cancelled.  It&#8217;s awful to admit, but I don&#8217;t know what made me sadder. </p>
<p>that said, I think this chili looks divine and will probably make it or something like it very soon.  Because you know, you just can&#8217;t go wrong with chili.</p>

				<p>Ha, I&#8217;m from Cincinnati &#8211; home of blasphemous chili!  Good chili is chili you like, whether it has beans and carrots, or cinnamon and chocolate.  But one thing&#8217;s for sure:  there&#8217;s nothing better on a cold, nippy day than a hot bowl of chili (with cheddar biscuits on the side).</p>

				<p>Lovely! Our son is about 6 weeks younger then your babe and he is the same way. Smashing food with his gums, and two little teeth, and wanting to feed himself (and can not do it at all) and likes finger foods.<br />
I have going to have to try this chili if it means that a baby who &#8220;wants to be an adult&#8221; will eat it without hand banging and lips a pucker.<br />
Thanks for sharing.</p>

				<p>Funny..when I saw the first picture, I thought, hmmm, sloppy joes on a biscuit?  Great Idea!  Chili is brilliant too, and I love almost any vegetable I can sneak into it.  I usually serve over rice or cornbread, but cheese biscuits beat that.  </p>
<p>I agree with Annie, who suggested folding the sticky mass of dough a few times before patting it out to cut.  It does give that laminated dough type of pouf to biscuits.  At least, it works on my usual biscuit, which is the Dot&#8217;s Diner recipe on Epicurious.</p>

				<p>After 40 years of marriage chili is something I have not mastered. My husband always use to say my chili never tasted the same each time I made it. I will definitely try thus recipe.

				<p>As a native Texan, I believe live and let live&#8230;if you want whatever in your chili, put it in there.  You are the one eating it.  Biscuits are just a comfort.  I think it&#8217;s great that you are feeding Jacob whatever you are eating, what a great way to get a kid to like something, but on a sad note my kid does not like cheese, though gradually getting him to eat it and it has to be melted. Yes he refuses to eat mac and cheese.  Loves pasta with a little olive oil, Italian spices and garlic which is healthier anyway, right?</p>

As for embracing the sport of football I highly recommend Holly Robinson Peete&#8217;s book &#8220;Get Your Own Damn Beer, I&#8217;m Watching The Game.&#8221;  In no time you too can love the game.</p>

				<p>This is kind of a strange question, but when I was growing up, I always said I didn&#8217;t like chili.  But I realized later, what I really didn&#8217;t like was the BEANS.  I still try to eat around them if I can get away with it.  That being said, would it be a total disaster if I left out the beans you think?  Would I have to scale the liquid or something?  I&#8217;ve always been afraid to make chili for this exact reason&#8230;I want to make what I like, but if it&#8217;s a complete catastrophe, I&#8217;m left with, well&#8230;.a whole pot of &#8220;chili&#8221; that no one wants to eat.</p>

				<p>Great post. :) You know what helps the football thing tremendously, IMHO? Start watching Friday Night Lights together. We get the sappy drama, he gets the exciting football games, both of us get the eye candy&#8230;the show&#8217;s gotten me more interested in Sunday games! That, and having a team to root for. (It didn&#8217;t hurt that I got a comfy Ravens sweatshirt out of it.)<br />
Oh, and my husband&#8217;s a veg (well, pescetarian) so I don&#8217;t get to do the Sunday roast chicken or pot roast or beef chili&#8230;I&#8217;ll have to try this w/o the meat.</p>

				<p>Looks great! I just made standard buttermilk biscuits yesterday for breakfast and was thinking about other goodies to put in them. I also like cheese and corn kernels and bacon in cornbread with chili. I&#8217;ve made quite good vegan chili with the soy crumbles made by various companies. There are turkey versions of Italian sausage that I have used with great success. My usual recipe has ground beef and ital.sausage, diced tomatoes, plus a lot of weird things, from beer and red wine to mustard, horseradish and HP sauce if I have it. And lots of beans, sometimes black, kidney and garbanzo. Halloween at our house is chili and cornbread, with &#8220;classic&#8221; scary movies projected on a screen at the end of the porch. Munsters Go Home last year, I think. The Blob, Creature from the Black Lagoon, etc. It&#8217;s fun to see the Trick-or-Treaters stare&#8230;</p>
<p>And good on you for introducing &#8220;more interesting&#8221; foods early. I figured that babies in other places ate garlic early, so why not my kid? Hummus was a very early food at our house, perfect texture and with a scrap of pita to scoop it not _too_ messy&#8230;Mine is now about 6.5 and surprised me by getting excited at Costco this weekend b/c he found Brussels sprouts in the cold room and insisted we buy them. I do usually cook them with bacon and maple syrup, but still.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m a Texan with one of those heirloom chili recipes. And I must confess, it contains tomatoes and beans, and I love it that way! Most Texans I know make their chili with beans&#8230;I think it&#8217;s just a few overly-zealous meat-lovers that are causing the fuss.</p>
<p>These carrots and bell peppers, however, do make me a little more nervous&#8230; but all traditional chili aside I bet it&#8217;s delicious! I may even try that out&#8211;but never tell my parents about it, of course.</p>

				<p>I agree football watching is like attending your child&#8217;s soccer game (only the soccer game is shorter, much shorter). You get points for being social, interactive (good wife/good mom points) and you get to veg, or knit, or nap.</p>
<p>The chili looks delicious and the biscuits make me want to consider switching from chili and cornbread muffins (which is how we do it at my house). Are the biscuits really as easy as they look?</p>

				<p>Fortunately for me, I love football, and tend to get very um&#8230; passionate about it. I&#8217;m the queen of the football party, and this chili will be making an appearance this season. (Once it cools down. Chili and 114 degree weather do not go together)</p>

				<p>The best thing about chili is that is so very personal.  When you make a pot of chili, you are serving up a bowl of insite into yourself.  I&#8217;m from Texas and make mine with three beans (pinto, red, kidney) and multiple meats (beef, lamb, pork and if available venison) but I do limit the tomatoes and bell peppers and go really heavy on the onions and garlic.  My mom swears to the addition of pepper (spicy) vinegar to help limit the (um) gas.  And the cumin comment is also spot on &#8211; really adds flavor.   Unfortunately my hubby can&#8217;t handle the heat so I don&#8217;t add much (jalapeno or chile pepper).  And for the biscuits, I&#8217;d substitue some cornmeal (stone ground) for the flour.  We love cornbread with chili and the mix sounds great. : )  Oh, and I love your site, stories and baby pics!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m also allergic to tomatoes, so I make a chili without them and increase whatever liquids I&#8217;m using. For a spaghetti sauce I sometimes use a puree of roasted red peppers and see no reason why it wouldn&#8217;t work in chili. For a different chili I add black beans, roasted corn and chunks of roasted winter squash, (usually butternut or sugar pumpkin.), though pumpkin puree might work as well.</p>

				<p>Love this presentation. I got into art of making chili a bit last when when I was invited to a cookoff of sorts for the Super Bowl this past season. Which meant friends, several chilis and no contest really! You know how everyone worked forever to perfect their chili and yet the one thing that brought the most comments was my lime crema. It worked with all of them and well, hate to call it mine, I mean&#8230;sour cream, a bit of lime juice and some grated lime rind? But you must try it, that one itty bitty change made all the difference!</p>
<p>So now am dying to try this with the addition of that lime&#8230;there is definitely a chill in the air in Denver; it is chili time!</p>

				<p>I was determined to be the same kind of wife! I actually found a love for the game, and now I can think of (hardly) nothing better than lazy football Sundays (I root for Giants, he roots for Jets), curling up on the couch and eating delicious food! My husband and I each make a couple of dishes and go nuts with eating all day &#8211; it&#8217;s the one day a week I don&#8217;t feel guilt over indulging (well, maybe just a little). This looks great!</p>

				<p>I made the biscuits last night with my own chili recipe (using black eyed-peas and black beans). I was totally second guessing the recipe when I saw it only called for 2 tablespoons of butter and no milk or eggs, but they turned out to be SOOO good. I substituted plain yogart for the sour cream, and it was so incredibly moist. I love this recipe, it is hard to work with, but totally worth the end results. I think I will try them as drop biscuits next time.</p>

				<p>Wow, made this for dinner last night and it was so yummy!.  I only used 1 and 3/4 pounds of ground beef and it still made 6 generous servings.  I left out the carrot (in chili just sounds weird, sorry) and used pinto beans instead of kidney.  It was delightful.  But, the definite star of the meal was the biscuits &#8211; omg,they were delicious!  I used light sour cream and just kind of formed them by hand instead of cutting them out.  I also happened to run out of baking powder so subbed in more baking soda and some cream of tartar, they rose up perfectly and were light and fluffy.  This meal will definitely be made again.  And yes, you are right, it is perfect football watching food!</p>

				<p>This is too funny!  As a Texan, I saw the big chunks of carrots in your picture and immediately cringed.  Then I saw your special note to people such as myself and cracked up.  I don&#8217;t really take my chili all that seriously and, as other Texans have mentioned, don&#8217;t take offense to the addition of some tomatoes or beans (though I happen to prefer it without) and know plenty of Texans who make it that way.  But the carrots and bell pepper I cannot abide.</p>

				<p>I feel I should chime in with my fellow Texans and reiterate that most of us aren&#8217;t as stubborn about chili as you&#8217;ve made us out to be.  Among the unconventional things I&#8217;ve added to chili are tortellini, mushrooms, wheat berries, and grated sweet potato.  To each his own, right?  That said, now just don&#8217;t go messing with our barbecue!</p>

				<p>These recipe looks absolutely delicious. The sour cream with the beef chili blends and contrasts both flavors into  the biscuits. I&#8217;ll see if I can give it a try.</p>

				<p>What a timely recipe. Next week is National Chili Week. This sounds really good, but I&#8217;m leaving out the green pepper and carrots. Being a native Texan, I&#8217;m taking no chances with the &#8220;tar and feathers&#8221; by adding those two ingredients. The tomato alone is pushing the envelope. But the jalapeno biscuits will be a delightful change from the jalapeno cornbread that is often served here with chili.</p>

				<p>I am a fifth generation Texan, have a tried and true chili recipe, which I LOVE, and this one looks amazing and delicious.</p>
<p>To heck with the detractors! is it good? OK then.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a TAD nervous about the carrots. That&#8217;s all, though.</p>
<p>And my mom, who always added beans to her chili (mine is a variation of that recipe, sans beans) is also a flag waving native, as was her mother and grandparents before her.</p>

				<p>Made this chili tonight and husband said it was my best chili ever!<br />
 This recipe is huge, served four adults, three kids and two toddlers with about a third left over for later in the week.  My advice is to not skip the carrots.  They were a great color and crunch addition.  Oi need to get some better or newer red pepper flakes because I used double the called for amount and it was tasty but not too hot.  Next time I&#8217;m adding corn.  The rangers may come after me!!</p>

				<p>Erin, if you wanted a similar effect to the tomato paste, you could try using a sweet pepper paste instead. The Balkan version is called Ajvar and is usually made with either just the sweet peppers, or sometimes with eggplant and sweet peppers. I&#8217;ve used both versions to cook with for taste and thickening purposes. I note Amazon sells Ajvar, if you can&#8217;t find it anywhere else.</p>

				<p>i took one look at that first image and wondered if my 15 month old, who also does not use a spoon, yet will not allow us to feed him from one would make an exception for something so tasty looking. glad to hear it&#8217;s toddler-approved! we will definitely try this out this weekend. the football, not so much.</p>

				<p>This looks AMAZING!  My second just turned one and refuses to be fed too.  We use the pre-loaded two-spoon method: at the beginning of the meal, I load one spoon with food while he shovels the other in.  After he&#8217;s half way through I just let him have at it.  Good times!</p>

				<p>Well, I&#8217;m not from Texas, so I can say with great sincerity that this chili looks fantastic.  I do happen to enjoy a good football game or two of the weekend and have been known to shout at the TV a time or two.  However, I would certainly take a time-out to make a big batch of this chili!</p>

				<p>This Texan &#8217;bout died laughing at your disclaimer.  It&#8217;s good that you put that in.  I&#8217;m not opposed to beans in my chili, per se, but I think pintos will be my bean of choice.  And I&#8217;ll second Ellicia and SandyH, and the others, who are generally opposed to carrots in their chili.  </p>

				<p>For the chili, I would suggest reducing the beef broth and adding a can of beer.  Budweiser to be exact.  For some reason, that is a great cooking beer.  This will add a certain body to the chili.</p>

				<p>Ah ha! You&#8217;ve solved the football sunday (or in my household Thursday evening through Monday evening) conundrum. Chili making, bread baking, having your way in the kitchen fun day. Our kitchen is in the same general space as the couch and tv, so as to make me feel like my husband and I are hanging out, even if he is completely emersed into the game(s) and I am focused solely on a recipe. I implore you to try a white chicken chili with monterrey jack cheese next.</p>

				<p>Deb, I love chili in all forms.  Must have been that snap of fall this weekend, as you are just one of many who made the dish for supper.  I applaud you for feeding Jacob foods that will expand his palate.  Thai babies, Indian babies, etc. don&#8217;t eat Gerber, is what I always told myself.  I believe all things in moderation but experimentation is good for young palates.  My almost-eight-year old used to slurp up thai noodles as a toddler and loves most all foods now.</p>

				<p>This chili recipe is sooo good and very easy to adapt! We didn&#8217;t have any beef or beans&#8230;I know the two main ingredients&#8230;so I substituted cubed chicken and little red potatoes. The result&#8230;empty bowls :-) For the biscuits I used a half cup of cornmeal (ran out of flour) and swiss cheese and they turned out pretty good!  The taste was great, but the texture was a bit crumbly and they fell apart when we tried to cut them in half. Excellent dinner! Thanks for the great ideas!!</p>

				<p>made the biscuits with my own chili last night, and I can&#8217;t believe how well this went over! I ended up getting 9 biscuits out of the recipe, but I just baked the 6 and froze the extras&#8230; so glad I did! when I woke up this morning the man who seemingly likes nothing was baking them up to take for lunch at work!<br />
the best part is I found this recipe ncredibly quick and easy, and the ingredients were so convenient I feel like I could throw it together&#8230;that never happens. THANKYOU.</p>

I can&#8217;t force myself to watch it, but now I blog about my husband&#8217;s soccer research. Does that qualify me for some kind of football widow award, I wonder? ;)</p>

				<p>I usually serve cornbread with my chili (which is quite similar to this recipe, I used to read Gourmet perhaps I picked up the general idea for my recipe from the magazine), but those biscuits sound delicious.</p>

				<p>Today is the perfect rainy Fall day for chili! Excellent choice! I&#8217;m substituting diced Roma tomatoes for most of the sauce, and black beans for the Kidney beans, and I cut the meat by half. </p>
<p>Anyone know if I can substitute plain Greek yoghurt for the sour cream in the biscuits? It works great as a topping for chili if you are out of sour cream (which I almost always am), but I don&#8217;t know if there are any differences baking with it.</p>

				<p>ok, i made this yesterday and it turned out just amazing! we have the perfect weather in California today for eating chili: rain, thunderstorm, lightning.<br />
i made quite a few modifications to the recipe: used 2 lbs ground beef, 1 red bell pepper, a lot more salt( i like my food SALTY), less paprika and chili powder(not by much though), pinto beans instead of kidney, juice from half a lemon instead of vinegar, and canned chunky tomato sauce.<br />
i&#8217;m so glad i made it. turned out just perfect!<br />
thanks Deb.</p>

				<p>The picture looks so incredibly delicious!!<br />
I tried it &amp; followed it to a T<br />
My husband ; who is of Indian decent; thinks its impossibly hot ( he thinks it smells and looks awesome; but difficult to eat due to the heat)  and FREAKED when he saw I added 1/4 chili powder.<br />
Did I use the wrong chili powder? Uh-oh?<br />
????<br />

				<p>I am a born and raised Texan, and while I&#8217;ll give you that we do a whole lot of things different from other parts of the country, I don&#8217;t think this is blasphemous I think it&#8217;s spectacular, it&#8217;s just two very different kinds of chili! Though I suppose living in Canada for the past year with a lack of tex-mex or real mexican food of any sort along with missing some fantastic bbq might have changed my tune a little bit!</p>

				<p>My fiance and I made this recipe yesterday for each other. he was on chili duty, and I took over the biscuits.</p>
<p>We altered the recipe just a tad: less meat, 1/2 s.cream, 1/2 non-fat plain yogurt, and a fresh jalepeno.</p>
<p>it turned out DIVINE. Flavors were muy bueno. Thanks so much for sharing. We&#8217;re already marking our calendars to make this again when it starts raining, here in the bay area.</p>

				<p>I made this today for the fam (and mainly myself, of course) and it was really good! I had to really get used to the cumin in there though, holy cow. Just now, when my husband heated up some left overs the entire house started smelling of it again. I&#8217;ve never had cumin in chili and it&#8217;s not bad, just really different. The biscuits -rise or no rise (no rise in my case as well)- are incredible! We&#8217;re a family of 6 (granted one is also a baby) and we only got through about half of this, and I&#8217;m not complaining: yummy left-overs tomorrow!</p>

				<p>Made this tonight, using 1.7 lbs mince (ground beef) and keeping all the other measurements the same. Next time I would add more heat, in the form of fresh chillies if I had any around, otherwise just add some more pickled jalapeno. But it&#8217;s delicious as is. The biscuits were so moist and light and flaky and utterly delectable that I balked at putting even half of one under a big ladle of chili on top. I did anyway, for the first serving, but thereafter put them only on top. I would sandwich the chili again only with day-old biscuits, toasted. Thanks for the recipes, Deb.</p>

				<p>I made this today and it is incredible. I left out the carrots (I dislike them) and added some diced tomatoes and everything came out just fine. It was also inexpensive (I had most of the ingredients on hand and found ground chuck on sale) and easy. Love it, this is a great autumn and winter dinner, I&#8217;ll be making it again soon. </p>
<p>Also, there&#8217;s far more than 6 servings of chili in this &#8211; I&#8217;d say at least 8, if not more.</p>

				<p>Well, I made this Friday night for dinner.  Wow!!  It was soo good.  My husband loved it.  He made sounds while eating it that made me a little uncomfortable&#8230;.and jealous, I think.  Since it&#8217;s just the two of us, I froze half of it&#8230;It made way more than six servings since we served it over the biscuits rather than having bowls of it.</p>

				<p>Okay, so I am definitely in the same boat as you. Hockey season has begun so most evenings and weekends my husband is plugged into the TV. This would be the perfect dish since the recipe is easy enough that I won&#8217;t feel bad when he shovels in food at commercial breaks. Coq au vin is not sports friendly, this is.

				<p>Coming back to comment post eating&#8230;my husband said this was the best chilli he&#8217;s ever had. :) It was very, very good. I made a bunch of substitutions (black beans for kidneys, diced fresh romas for canned sauce, a bit less chilli powder since I wanted the kid to eat it too, one fresh minced jalapeno (seeds removed) instead of jarred, and used only half the meat, but the essential flavors remained the same. I believe the vinegar may be the key ingredient, I&#8217;d never tried that before and I make chilli fairly often during the cold seasons. </p>
<p>Oh, and Greek-style yoghurt CAN substitute for the sour cream in the biscuit recipe. I found somewhere online that said you can substitute 1:1, just add an extra teaspoon of baking powder. My biscuits rose slightly more than the ones in your photos and were very tender and delicious. I think if I make those again I&#8217;d double the shredded cheese, they were not quite as cheesy as I was hoping for.</p>

				<p>I must be on a similar wavelength, because I made chili last weekend that was parallel to this recipe while watching (and shouting at) a baseball game. (Red Sox, muffled sob.) I was cleaning out the freezer to make room for this year&#8217;s garden harvest and hauled out a big package of ground venison &#8211; a gift from a hunter friend last year. So my chili used venison instead of beef, dark beer instead of vinegar, black beans instead of kidney, and roasted red sweet pepper instead of green. I confess to adding a bit of sugar too. So&#8230; exactly the same but with everything changed. But really yummy.</p>

				<p>I made this yesterday and it was amazing!!!  I was frightened by two things, the first being carrots and the second being the pickled jalapenos in the biscuits.  But the carrots were delicious in the chili, who knew???  And I didn&#8217;t even miss the flavor of the masa flour that I normally put in my chili.  As far as the pickled jalapenos are concerned, I grew up in the southwest and we never use pickled, just fresh.  So, I used fresh ones from my garden that I seeded and they tasted super delish in the biscuits!  Mine did not rise either, but they were fluffy and yummy and got a lot of praise from the family.  Next time though, I&#8217;ll wait until it&#8217;s less than 90 degrees to make it :)  Fall, please hurry yourself along!</p>

				<p>This was a wonderful recipe!  I took your advice and diced the carrots and the texture was perfect.  I couldn&#8217;t find pickled jalapeños so I pickled a fresh one with apple cider vinegar and red wine vinegar.  The biscuits did not rise so much but they did not suffer for it at all.  Everything was absolutely delicious and my husband was very happy.</p>

				<p>Invited a bunch of friends with all their kids over this weekend for a bon fire. Our high temperature for the day was around 50 degrees. We were going to grill but decided because of the cool temps to make a double batch of your chili.I also made individual cornbreads* (they were easier) instead of the cheddar bisuits. Your chili was a winner! Lots of second helpings. All the kids loved it!<br />
*The cornbread tastes exactly like what you get a Boston Market. It&#8217;s made by mixing together 1 box of Jiffy cornbread mix with 1 box of Jiffy yellow cake mix. Follow the directions for eggs and milk on the back of each box. It makes 8 mini cornbread loafs.(Use a &#8220;muffin&#8221; pan with the 8 rectangular mini loaf forms.)</p>

				<p>Thank you, Deb!  Another winner.   The chili is my new go-to recipe.  I skipped the green pepper, because I don&#8217;t like them, and added the carrot because I always add carrots to chili.  I should have heeded your advice to use parchment when your cookie sheets are well-seasoned, because my biscuits were too brown on the bottom.  And mine only rose as much as yours.</p>

				<p>Deb, thank you for the wonderful photos which always convince me to broaden my culinary horizons!  I am a Texan born and raised, but I grew up shamefully chili-deprived.  My only two options were canned chili and my mother&#8217;s bland no-spice ground beef stew which she called &#8220;chili&#8221; (she and my dad are both mid-westerners and are terrified of even small amounts of spice).  So needless to say, I&#8217;ve never really been interested in chili&#8230; like at all.  But boy, these pictures won me over.  I made a 1/2 recipe of it tonight, and even my super picky eater boyfriend ate a whole bowl!  I even kept the carrots in since I&#8217;m trying to teach myself to like them, and I found myself actually looking forward to bites with carrot in them!  I can&#8217;t believe I made my first and favorite chili from a recipe posted by a New Yorker!  :)</p>

				<p>I tried this over the weekend and it was awesome!! My boyfriend (who&#8217;s more picky than a toddler) loved it. I brought the rest into work and everyone who tried it thought it was amazing. The biscuits weren&#8217;t that great but that was my fault, I put them on the lower rack in the over and the bottoms burned but I will try again!! Thank you for this recipe, its been added to my ever-growing arsenal of things I can actually make</p>

				<p>Your timing on posting this recipe was on the verge of mind-reader scary! Made it! Loved it! And those biscuits? A-mazing. I followed some of the commenters suggestions of folding the dough and achieved what appeared to be a nice height. Thank you for this inspiring website. Between you and my ATK cookbook I&#8217;m set and seriously considering donating the rest of my cookbooks which now just seem to be taking up prime tiny apartment kitchen real estate. I will, however, save a space for your book.</p>

				<p>I just finished the rest of this chili for lunch, and although I think I make a pretty good chili, this one was better.  So, so good.  I&#8217;m sorry it is gone.  I added some cayenne to increase the heat, used homemade tomato sauce, omitted the paprika, and otherwise followed your recipe.  I never added a carrot to my chili before, but really liked it&#8230; the bell pepper too.  I had some cornmeal that needed to be used up, so this time around I made cornbread, but next time those biscuits are all mine.  Yum.  Thanks for posting this!</p>

				<p>An America&#8217;s Test Kitchen episode once suggested putting all the spices in and &#8220;roasting&#8221; them before adding in the onions and garlic (and I guess carrots).  I started doing this and (I think) the flavor is enhanced.  (Hard to know if it is, but it seems so to me, so I continue to do it this way ;-)</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to try these biscuits (I love having biscuits (and par baked bread or rolls) in my freezer that I can just throw in the oven!)</p>

				<p>THIS RECIPE WAS A HIT. I was inspired by the recipe to be a Good Football Girlfriend this past weekend.  I thought I would have a bunch of leftovers, but we cleaned our plates and went back for more. I was especially proud of the biscuits, as I have never made them before &amp; they turned out perfectly.  The dough was for sure a sticky mess, but a little flour on my fingers solved that pretty quickly. I may have pounded out the dough a little too thin, as I had extra dough after I cut my 6 biscuits, but I just formed those into &#8220;dipping logs&#8221; for the chili and baked those as well!</p>

				<p>Deb- I knew you would stumble into the art of baby food making!! congrats on the new-ish site.  I would LOVE to see a pic of your freezer showing how you store all your baby food.  I used to use the ice cube method and then put them into ziplocks, but i know you probably have a way cooler way of storing your yummy stuff!  keep up the good food!</p>

				<p>These biscuits were perfect with chili!  I doubled the recipe and found the dough to be a bit dry (it never quite came together).  I added a bit of milk (about 1/2 cup) and that seemed to do the trick.  Thanks for the recipe!</p>

				<p>Made the biscuits only as I had a good chili in the freezer.  Substituted plain (undrained) yogurt and an extra teaspoon of soda; biscuit was moist and tasty.  I imagine sour cream would have yielded a firmer outcome but, hey, I had the yougart in the fridge! As suggested, consumed in front of the TV during Sunday Night Football.  Great!</p>

				<p>Thanks so much for this recipe Deb! I made the biscuits with my own chili for a work chili cook off and they were amazing! I made them super little 1.25 inch rounds and they doubled in height in the oven. I had to substitute Greek yogurt as well for not having any sour cream and they were fluffy and delicious. Thank goodness I made a double batch and froze some for tonight. Next time I&#8217;m making the chili recipe and maybe I&#8217;ll win.</p>

				<p>The weather here in FL is finally cooling down (okay, not really but the humidity is gone!) time for some fall flavors.  Made the chili yesterday. As per your suggestion i diced my carrots and cut the meat by 1 lb. thinking 2 was plenty. I also added cinnamon to the spices, about  1 1/2 t and did not add any crushed peppers because my daughter is uber sensitive to anything spicy.   I used my standing mixer to throw the biscuits together mixing just until the dough came together and added some chopped chives. The rise on the biscuits was not super high but they tasted great. my 4 year old devoured it all.<br />
thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>Hi. This looks really good and I&#8217;m really keen to try but just a question about the biscuits. Do you mean &#8217;sift&#8217; the first 4 ingredients rather than &#8216;whisk&#8217;? Not sure what you mean about whisking? Is it maybe an Americanism that I&#8217;ve missed? We don&#8217;t really do football (unless you mean soccer) here in the UK but loving any excuse for snacks :-)</p>

				<p>Just made this for dinner with some slight tweaks-and it turned out amazing. As a life-long bean hater, this actually made them palatable. My biscuits didn&#8217;t turn out great, but that was my own fault-lack of enough sour cream led me to use buttermilk instead, which led to them becoming slightly spongy drop biscuits-still delicious piled with chili! Can&#8217;t wait for dessert&#8230;the apple &amp; plum pie above. Thanks for making my Saturday!</p>

				<p>Eh, forget all the Texan rules about chili. Coming from a die hard Texan, this chili was FANTASTIC! Oddly, my grocery store was out of green peppers so I subbed in 2 poblano peppers. I think that could be a perm suggested substitute because DANG they were good. And I don&#8217;t like green pep&#8217;s all that much so it worked out perfectly. Thank you!</p>

				<p>My roommate and I are first-year grad students, and pretty much the only time we have to cook a good, full breakfast meal is on the weekends. We made the biscuits this past Saturday, and they were SO amazing. We had monterey jack laying around so we subbed that for cheddar and skipped the jalapenos. I like my biscuits high and fluffy rather than flaky, and these were perfect; they will definitely become a regular. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!</p>

				<p>I made these biscuits alongside my favorite chili recipe. I panicked when I pulled the biscuits out because they looked giant and thought I should have rolled them thinner and made 12 biscuits instead of 6. But once I tasted them I was sold. They are light and fluffy and delicious and I easily ate two! I subbed some chopped scallion for the jalapenos and managed to get 7 large biscuits out of the dough.</p>

				<p>I make a chili much like this one. No idea where the recipe came from anymore, but a couple of things I&#8217;ve played with, with success: ground turkey instead of beef and the juice of one whole lime on the turkey just after mixing in the spices, but before adding anything else.</p>

				<p>I have never really understood the beer and chili connection.  I have had friends take a couple of cans of Wolf Brand Chili and add beer to it to make it taste a little bit better.  Our chili recipes are fairly similar with the exception of the beer and adding carrots to the chili.  I definately want to try adding the carrots and beer to my next batch of chili.</p>

				<p>Made this the other night and it was fantastic!  I didn&#8217;t let the peppers cook long enough so they weren&#8217;t as tender as I would have liked, however, it hardly detracted from the taste at all.  The biscuit/chili mix is brilliant.  Totally worth the mess of eating like an open-faced sandwich with the biscuit just about drowning in the chili.</p>

				<p>Just made this tonight!! Although since its about midnight, I can&#8217;t justify baking the biscuits. That will be a project for tomorrow. I think next time, I&#8217;ll add some corn in there too, just to up the veggies count &#8211; im a first-year grad student (i.e. no time!!), so any way to get more vegetables in there is probably a good thing. Thanks, this is absolutely delicious and perfect for a fall weekend!</p>

				<p>Thank you for this biscuit recipe!  The timing was perfect.  I was looking for another recipe to adapt to gluten-free&#8230;to use with sausage patties for breakfast sandwiches!  (Gotta get the kid to stop eating the on-the-run wheat options!)  It was an overwhelming winner!  I keep some in the freezer for myself now, too!  SO GOOD!  Keep &#8216;em coming!</p>

				<p>This looks delicious!  I can&#8217;t wait to make my big batch of chili. Unfortunately I went to a big southeastern football school and usually spend my weekends watching football and missing out on the cooking.  </p>
<p>I used to do my biscuits with a pastry blender, but alton brown suggests freezing the butter, then grating it in with a cheese grater and kind of tossing it with the flour until some of it works its way in.  Its now my #1 way to make biscuits (though I still use the pastry blender for, you know, pastry :)  ).</p>

				<p>I made the chili and biscuits last night and we really enjoyed it. The only thing I think I&#8217;d do next time is drain the meat before adding the liquids. It&#8217;s HIGHLY possible I started with too much oil and that may have been my problem, but other than it being a little oilier than I think it should have been (I solved the problem by serving through my spider ladle) it was DELICIOUS! And the biscuits were super yummy this morning with scrambled eggs.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to find a good chili recipe for a while and this one has definitely jumped to number 1! I did make some adjustments though.  I guess I prefer a tomato-y-er, sweeter chili so I added a whole can of chopped tomatoes plus somewhere between a 1/4 to a half cup of tomato paste.  I also added some beer which I think should be a requirement for all chili.  It gives it such an amazing flavor, try it!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m so glad I came across this! We have a chili cook off tomorrow for our church Halloween activity and I was going to use my dad&#8217;s recipe, but the ingredients in his get pretty pricey, but this looks like so yummy and easy to make! We&#8217;re recent transplants to Austin TX so hopefully we won&#8217;t be run out of town for our nonTtexas chili!</p>

				<p>I made this chili last night. It turned out delicious! I ended up adding a lot more liquid than called for in the recipe &#8211; a little extra beef broth and added about 3/4 cup of good dark beer. Turned out great, but next time I would probably just reduce the meat to 2 lbs as you suggested. The biscuits were AWESOME. I live at about 5400 ft, and didn&#8217;t have to change anything. I actually reduced the baking powder slightly. Overall, perfect late fall/winter meal. Thanks for posting!!!</p>

				<p>Texas girl here and while I found the carrots and green peppers not quite kosher for Texas chili, I decided to go ahead and try the recipe as is.  I did shred the carrots with a vegetable peeler and then chop them a little with a knife, so they sort of melted into the chili, adding a little sweetness, which was nice.  I also put the green peppers in at the same time so they cooked down more.  It really makes a good chili and I&#8217;m glad I brached out from my usual recipe.  Always nice to have a variety.</p>
<p>Somehow, I ran out of jalapenos (which could be grounds for expulsion from the state!) so I used green (hatch) chilis instead.  It was a great substitution!  It also made me think that you could use Pepper Jack cheese and get 2 ingredients in 1.</p>
<p>Thanks for another great recipe!</p>

				<p>Okay, first thing I&#8217;m from Texas&#8230;and I enjoy beans in my chili. There I said it. Which recipe did you like best this one or the red bean chili? I&#8217;m dying to make chili because it&#8217;s 50 degrees out and I want to make it before it becomes 85 again. Which is very likely with the way Texas weather goes.</p>

				<p>A cautionary tale:<br />
Make sure that your spice jars are clearly labelled. ALWAYS! Long story short, I used cayenne in place of about half of the chili powder, and the only way to use the chili was to make huge batches of burritos, empanadas, and the like, and use the chili as a seasoning.  It was just unbearably spicy.  Such a shame, because the biscuits were great and the chili seemed like it would have been delicious. I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh at myself though.</p>

				<p>This is the same recipe my mother made for years! She was the only one I ever knew who put carrots in chili, and we love it that way! I did tweak the recipe a bit, since I&#8217;m a chili freak and can&#8217;t help ordering chili in any new place we go to eat, and over the years have only found 3 that I even bothered to duplicate.<br />
The only difference is that I add triple the cumin, I no longer use tomato sauce since I&#8217;ve found that tomato juice has a richer flavor, and I use black beans now instead of kidney beans.I add vinegar, too, but occasionally I like to add a different kick, and use a good ale instead, about a cup will do, then you don&#8217;t need the extra broth.<br />
BTW, LOVE your site, I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of great recipes from you that are now family favorites! Oh, and &#8217;round here, it&#8217;s Pittsburgh chili!!!</p>

				<p>This is a great recipe!  I love the addition of carrots to chili &#8211; add some healthy veggies and a nice texxture.  I played around with the amounts a little and only used about two pounds of beef and some tomato juice as I was not going to serve the shortcake style and wanted thinner chili.  The biscuits were awesome!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m a longtime lurker/fan, who&#8217;s been forced to come out of hiding to comment on this recipe because it is so, so wonderful! I&#8217;m also a lifelong resident of Texas (a native South Texan, actually), currently residing in Austin. In other words, I know my chili. And I know a bit about savory, rib-sticking, heart-warming food.</p>
<p>This recipe is, in a word, AMAZING. My boyfriend (also a native Texan) appeared a bit skeptical as I assembled the ingredients, but he practically *inhaled* a huge bowl (even though we&#8217;d already eaten dinner, and even though it was nearly midnight)! The flavors melded perfectly and produced what I believe to be the BEST bowl of chili I&#8217;ve ever had. My boyfriend agrees that it&#8217;s among the best he&#8217;s tasted, though he would like to raise the heat level even more than I did. I love the simplicity of the preparation and, as others have mentioned, the ease with which you can individualize the recipe.</p>
<p>I used coarse chuck (which broke down very nicely) &amp; reduced the meat by 1 lb, since we do like our chili a bit &#8220;saucy&#8221;. The recipe still yielded PLENTY, and the consistency was just what we desired. I diced the carrots instead of slicing, as recommended, which really seemed to help them integrate well. I also added an extra TBS of minced garlic (we are garlic fiends), one chopped serrano pepper, and an extra 1/2 TBS of red pepper flakes. This yielded a chili that was not extremely spicy at first taste, but definitely had a bit of heat on the finish. In other words, PERFECT (in my opinion).</p>
<p>This was the first time I made biscuits from scratch, and the results were beautiful. I was so proud! I mixed the butter in by hand &amp; got a very nice rise. I loved watching the cheese ooze out as the biscuits turned golden. These are highly addictive! I think next time I would like to add a *tad* more cheese, perhaps an extra 1/4 cup?</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ve gone on &amp; on, in true Texas fashion. I&#8217;ll finish by saying:<br />
Thank you, Deb. Thank you for giving me more confidence in the kitchen &amp; for adding flawless recipes to my repertoire.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been a serious cook for 40 years &#8211; and come from a family of serious cooks. For most of my life, my favorite reading has been reading cookbooks that TALK to you. My niece, who&#8217;s father is the best home cook I know, passed your site around.  My daughter (who follows our family&#8217;s foodie nuttiness) told me she lives by your site.  I haven&#8217;t had time to deal with this new technology.  I blog, twitter and fb for my work &#8212;  but I couldn&#8217;t transition.  Till now.  DD is home and cooked the chili w/biscuits for the Sunday Patriots game.(All we needed was snow and it&#8217;s coming).  The chili is outrageously de-li-cious&#8211;  and I don&#8217;t LIKE chili!   I&#8217;ve just spent my morning reading your site and laughing out loud (a welcome sound). Your recipes are solid, creative and really good reading.   I&#8217;m going to twitter to look for you now.</p>

				<p>After a day of snow this was perfect tonight!  I substituted chipoltes for the jalapeños in the biscuits and they are amazing.</p>

				<p>I just tried this recipe for my DH and his friend while they watched the Jets &amp;Steelers game, and they loved it!  I didn&#8217;t want to open a huge catron of beef broth only to use 1 1/4 c., so I poured a bottle of lager instead, and I added some black beans too.  It was really good with the biscuits and very hearty!  I recently came across your site, and I&#8217;m so glad I did!  It would be great if you could add a category in your index called &#8220;winners&#8221; or something so us readers know which ones we should really try right away :)</p>

				<p>Hi! I absolutely can&#8217;t wait to try this recipe. I&#8217;m drooling over it in my night class&#8230; I also mentioned it on my blog here: <a href="http://livingonthechic.blogspot.com/2011/01/monday-night-class.html" rel="nofollow">http://livingonthechic.blogspot.com/2011/01/monday-night-class.html</a> Thank you so much for sharing it!</p>

				<p>Hi! I tried this recipe this past weekend when my boyfriend and I didn&#8217;t feel like venturing out for dinner. It turned out wonderfully! We made about a half batch of chili (still had lots of left overs!) and the full batch of biscuits. We omitted the beans, which made it more like a stew, but it still turned out great. Also, we didn&#8217;t have any jalapenos on hand, so they were just cheese biscuits, but they were still awesome. The left overs have definitely staved off the ridiculously cold weather we&#8217;ve been having in Boston.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m making this combo today&#8211;  but suddenly I&#8217;m looking at the quantities:  6 biscuits for all that chili?  Any idea on how many servings of chili I&#8217;ll get with the biscuits?</p>

				<p>The chili is supposed to serve six. We stretched it further, but there&#8217;s no harm in making extra biscuits.</p>

				<p>I posted a tribute to your recipe. It looks delicious. I used it as a jumping off point to use up some leftovers I had. I hope to make your real recipe soon! Check it out:<br />

				<p>Yes, I am new to your site, a friend told me about it. I am enjoying reading the blog and tried my first recipe. The Chili, I thought it was good, but I loved the biscuits.The recipe did not call for draining the beef, which I did.</p>

				<p>I made this last week as a throw-together-one-pot dinner for my dad and my husband.  I left out the beans (the healthiest part, of course) because both my husband and I have this anti-kidney bean thing from childhood.  Also, I confess, I couldn&#8217;t find any high quality ground beef, so I used turkey instead.  No worries, the chili was still deelish!  It was so well-seasoned that nobody even noticed the difference until I mentioned it.  I didn&#8217;t have time to make shortcakes, so it just happened in bowls the old fashioned way, but everyone seemed happy with that.</p>
<p>And those BISCUITS.  I ate SEVEN.  Not good for my post-baby hips, but totally worth it.  Even perfectly good reheated the next day.  I guess the cheese kept them super moist?  I&#8217;ll have to be very careful about making these again, they&#8217;re just too good.  Thanks Deb!</p>

				<p>I made this the other night when my boyfriend was coming from Canada (to the UK) and was extremely jet-lagged. As an English boy I had to teach him what biscuits were, but he absolutely LOVED them! And they really work so well with this delicious chilli! I froze some of the pre-formed biscuits as you suggested because I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d eat them all, and I had quite a bit of chilli leftover which I cooked up the following night with the biscuits and, interestingly, the biscuits were much larger and fluffier after being frozen! Don&#8217;t know whether anyone else has found this before but I thought it was quite interesting! I now made another batch and froze them for whenever I&#8217;m in a hurry (and hungry!!)</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve lived in Texas almost 2/3 of my life, and to me it isn&#8217;t chili without kidney beans. Maybe it is because I grew up in Louisiana, but for me, the more veggies the better!</p>
