<H1>MRS. FIELDS' COOKIES?</H1>
<p>
<p>
The single most frequent question my correspondents ask is, "Do you know
where I can find the Mrs. Fields cookie recipe?" I never had any idea
where to get it until recently, when a woman in my office brought in some
very fine cookies, and when I complimented her, told me she had made them
"from Mrs. Fields' recipe."
<p>
Well, I cannot vouch for the authenticity of this recipe, but I can tell
you this: the cookies were EXCELLENT. I'd personally still add more
vanilla, but that's a minor quibble.
<p>
Thanks, Patti!

leave this out); and 3 cups chopped nuts
