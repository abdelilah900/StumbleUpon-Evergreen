        	<p><img width="267" vspace="10" hspace="30" height="296" align="right" alt="" src="http://www.onlinedegreeshub.com/wp-content/uploads/acc.jpg" />Playing sports at the highest level requires an intense competitive drive in which failure is never an accepted result. Michael Jordan&#8217;s desire to win, for example, was unparalleled during his time in the NBA, which is why he never lost an NBA Finals and is unanimously regarded as the greatest basketball player the game has ever seen. It&#8217;s what separates the elite ones from the good ones. Each player or team below <a href="http://www.onlinedegreeshub.com/" target="new">achieved greatness</a> &#8212; a much-coveted record or championship &#8212; but received some unfair help along the way. Of course, how much that help tainted their accomplishments varies; some deserve asterisks, while others ought to be stricken from the record books altogether. Ultimately, though, it&#8217;s the popular opinion of sport fans that determines the athletes&#8217; legacies.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2965584"><strong>Barry Bonds&#8217; single-season homerun record (73)</strong></a>: Already one of the game&#8217;s best players before he began setting homerun records, Bonds didn&#8217;t need steroids to cement his status as a Hall of Famer. He already struck fear into the hearts of opposing pitchers, as evidenced by the time he was intentionally walked with the bases loaded by Buck Showalter&#8217;s Diamondbacks. But for Bonds, that&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t enough. In the bestselling book <i>Game of Shadows</i>, reporters Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams claim that his jealousy of the acclaim received by McGwire during the 1998 homerun chase inspired him to juice. Bonds was implicated as a possible user when the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Laboratory_Co-operative" target="new">BALCO scandal</a> broke in 2003, two years after he broke the single-season homerun record. He has since been convicted for obstruction of justice for testifying that he never knowingly took steroids.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/brennan/2011-04-20-bud-selig-barry-bonds_N.htm"><strong>Barry Bonds&#8217; career homerun record (762)</strong></a>: Baseball fans who remember watching Bonds before 1998 know that he was a consistent power threat who really didn&#8217;t really need steroids. During his first 12 seasons in the league (1986 to 1997), he hit 374 homeruns, leading the National League with 46 in 1993. During his final 10 seasons (1998 to 2007), however, when he was in his mid-30s to mid-40s, his power stroke was at its all-time best. He hit 388 homeruns during that period, including 45 in the season he turned 40 years old. Never before has a player experienced such a surge at such an age. BALCO scandal aside, it&#8217;s easy to understand why so many eyebrows were raised as it all was unfolding.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/07/sports/on-pro-football-cheap-sack-will-cost-favre-and-strahan.html"><strong>Michael Strahan&#8217;s single-season sack record (22.5)</strong></a>: Everyone was cheering for Strahan to break Mark Gastineau&#8217;s single-season record of 22 sacks, even Brett Favre. In the waning moments of the final game of the 2001 season, Strahan was stuck on 21.5, and it appeared as though he&#8217;d end up forever stuck in second place. That&#8217;s when Favre, with a comfy lead and fewer than three minutes remaining, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcDYI8VQNcs" target="new">took it upon himself</a> to ensure his buddy made history, running a naked bootleg toward Strahan without a blocker. The sack and record were subsequently recorded, and everyone involved had a good chuckle.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_National_Football_League_videotaping_controversy"><strong>New England Patriots&#8217; 2007 undefeated regular season</strong></a>: Finishing the regular season undefeated was an impressive feat by the Patriots, regardless of their ultimate demise in the Super Bowl. Now if they had done it without any hint of cheating, it would&#8217;ve been even more impressive &#8212; <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/patriots/2007-11-06-shula-comments_N.htm" target="new">just ask Don Shula</a>. Spygate broke after the Patriots&#8217; first game of the season against the rival Jets when it was revealed that Bill Belichick&#8217;s staff videotaped the Jets&#8217; defensive coaches&#8217; signals. As a result, the NFL levied steep penalties, fining Belichick $500,000 and the Patriots $250,000 and revoking the team&#8217;s 2008 first round draft pick. Additional accusations were made by former team video assistant Matt Walsh &#8212; including that the Patriots had recorded the Rams&#8217; walkthrough before Super Bowl XXVI &#8212; but nothing came of it.</li>
<li><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1998/feb/27/sports/sp-23531"><strong>Nykesha Sales&#8217; UConn women&#8217;s basketball all-time scoring record (2,178)</strong></a>: Given the illustrious history of the UConn women&#8217;s basketball program, it&#8217;s no surprise that one of its best players would covet the program&#8217;s all-time scoring record. Sales was well on her way until she suffered a collegiate career-ending Achilles tendon injury, preventing her from getting the one basket she needed to reach 2,178 points. Instead of accepting it as tough luck, coach Geno Auriemma, with the approval of the Big East Commissioner and previous record-holder Kerry Bascom, orchestrated a staged, uncontested layup against Villanova that enabled her to get the total and end her career on a positive note. According to Auriemma, it was done to make up for all the occasions he made her sit during blowouts.</li>
<li><a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/more/01/18/lance.armstrong/index.html"><strong>Lance Armstrong&#8217;s consecutive Tour de France wins (7)</strong></a>: It&#8217;s a remarkable story no matter what. Armstrong survived metastatic testicular cancer and proceeded to compete at the highest level of cycling. But his seven consecutive Tour de France victories are heavily scrutinized, as numerous accusations of doping have been made by journalists and cyclists, including teammate and confirmed doper Floyd Landis. Suspicion has arisen primarily due to his relationship with controversial trainer Michele Ferrari, and more infamously, a 2006 report from the French sports newspaper <i>L&#8217;Equipe</i> claiming to have six urine samples collected during the 1999 Tour de France that tested positive for erythropoietin, a hormone that control red blood cell production. Because Armstrong&#8217;s accomplishments were so improbable, many cycling fans will never accept them as legitimate, even if the accusations are never proven.</li>
<li><a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067804/index.htm"><strong>Ben Johnson&#8217;s 100m world record and gold medal</strong></a>: Johnson became the story of the 1988 Olympics after he <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE7-JOs3VFE" target="new">defeated Carl Lewis in the 100m final</a>, broke his own world record and was disqualified after it was revealed his urine samples contained stanozolol, an anabolic steroid derived from testosterone. The episode led to him admitting that he used steroids before he set the world record in the 1987 World Championships, which resulted in it being rescinded. Charlie Francis, his coach, later admitted that he introduced Johnson to steroids in 1981. Johnson went from Canadian hero to international villain in characteristically quick fashion, and has since been one of the first names associated with Olympic cheating.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/04/AR2007100401666.html"><strong>Marion Jones&#8217; five Olympic medals</strong></a>: Like Johnson and many other athletes who use steroids, the initial reason people were suspicious of Jones was her association with dirty coaches, including Charlie Francis. The association that truly did her in, however, was with BALCO. In 2004, founder Victor Conte claimed that he provided her with performance enhancing drugs before and during the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx_-DpRDwIs&amp;feature=related" target="new">2000 Olympics</a>, and testimony from her ex-husband CJ Hunter, a shot putter who tested positive for performance enhancing drugs prior to the same Olympics, indicated that he knew of her use of PEDs. Three years later, Jones admitted to lying to federal agents about her pre-2000 Olympics steroid use, and publically apologized for betraying the trust of Americans. Consequently, she forfeited all five of her medals that she won during the 2000 Olympics, including the three golds.</li>
<li><a href="http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_1972_usa_ussr_gold_medal_hoop.html"><strong>USSR&#8217;s 1972 men&#8217;s basketball gold medal</strong></a>: A classic red versus red, white and blue showdown, the 1972 basketball final featured two formidable clubs. The American team was composed of amateurs, and it had never lost a game in the Olympics. The Soviets were experienced and hungry for their first gold, and it showed as they took a 10-point lead with 10 minutes remaining in the game. The Americans made a gutsy comeback to take the lead with three seconds to play, with Doug Collins&#8217; two free throws capping off the run. That&#8217;s when the chaos began. The Soviets inbounded the ball, the referee stopped the game with a second left and the clock was reset to three seconds because the Soviets weren&#8217;t given the timeout they called between Collins&#8217; free throws. The Soviets failed to score on their second chance and the Americans thought they had secured the gold, but the game still wasn&#8217;t over. Because the clock wasn&#8217;t properly reset, the Soviets got a third chance. This time, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9COEbgjvOI" target="new">Alexander Belov scored the game-winning layup</a>. The Americans reacted by filing a formal complaint with the International Basketball Federation, which sided with the Soviets, and the team never claimed its silver medals.</li>
<li><a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1064996/index.htm"><strong>Argentina&#8217;s 1986 World Cup victory</strong></a>: The &quot;Hand of God&quot; goal still lives in World Cup infamy, somewhat overshadowing an otherwise magnificent tournament performance from one of soccer&#8217;s legends, Diego Maradona. The Argentine captain tallied five assists and five goals, including the one that shouldn&#8217;t have counted &#8212; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbbsytHDp2o" target="new">the first goal</a> in his team&#8217;s 2-1 victory over England. His second goal, in which he swiveled around defenders and dribbled half the length of the field, is widely regarded as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rW-lK9F6TU" target="new">one of greatest in World Cup history</a>. Expectedly, the Brits took the handball goal and loss hard. The game came four years after the Falklands War, and given the two nations&#8217; proficiency in soccer, it held extra meaning. Years later, Maradona admitted that he intended to hit the ball with his hand.</li>
