<p><b>First, get the Pot.</b> You need the <a target="_blank" href=http://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-NHS-06-3-Cup-Rice-Cooker/dp/B00004S575/rogerebcom-20&linkCode=as2>simplest rice cooker</a> made. It comes with two speeds: Cook, and Warm. Not expensive. Now you're all set to cook meals for the rest of your life on two square feet of counter space, plus a chopping block. No, I am not putting you on the Rice Diet. Eat what you like. I am thinking of you, student in your dorm room. You, solitary writer, artist, musician, potter, plumber, builder, hermit. You, parents with kids. You, night watchman. You, obsessed computer programmer or weary web-worker. You, lovers who like to cook together but don't want to put anything in the oven. You, in the witness protection program. You, nutritional wingnut. You, in a wheelchair. <p>

<blockquote><blockquote>And you, serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. You, person on a small budget who wants healthy  food. You, shut-in. You, recovering campaign worker. You, movie critic at Sundance.  You, sex worker waiting for the phone to ring. You, factory worker sick of frozen meals. You, people in Werner Herzog's documentary about  life at the South Pole. You, early riser skipping breakfast.

Yes, you, reader of the second-best best-written blog on the internet.

We will begin with a scientific conundrum. You put Minute Rice and the correct amount of water into the Pot, and click to Cook. Minutes later, the Pot clicks over to Warm. Tomorrow night, you put whole grain organic rice and the correct amount of water into the Pot, and click to Cook. An hour later, the Pot clicks over to Warm. Both nights, the rice is perfectly cooked.</p>

The point here is to save you some time and money.

<p>The eternal dilemma: Which rice? </b>  Minute Rice cooks fine in the Pot, if you will but follow the exact instructions on the box. Later, I will instruct you not to read instructions. That's further down. For now, <i> read the Minute Rice box! </i> It is called Minute Rice for a reason. If you let it Cook or Warm for half an hour, you are going to be poking around your Pot looking for your rice. </p>

<p>Minute Rice is for when you're in a big hurry and nutrition be damned. Minute Rice has been painstakingly deprived of its vitamins and things, which are fed to boars and captive chickens. Use real rice. Brown rice is good for you. Basmati is nice. Don't overlook other grains and pastas. [Note: Someone wrote in saying oh, oh, I can't eat this or that kind of rice! I'm allergic! <i> Then don't eat it. </i> Do you think I want to give you the hives?] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-10%252dCup-Rice-Cooker/dp/B000QDUCQI/rogerebcom=UTF8&amp;s=home-garden&amp;qid=1225517030&amp;sr=1-3"></a></i></b> </p>

<p>I am not a French gourmet. I am a practical cook. An American, Urbana-born, and go at things as I have taught myself, free-style, and will make a cookbook in my own way.  When I cook, I want to eat in the immediate future. I can cook for my wife or the whole family as easily as for me. And, as Travis Bickle says, "anytime, anywhere." To be sure, health problems now prevent me from eating. That has not discouraged my cooking. Now cooking is an exercise more pure, freed of biological compulsion.</p></p>

<p><b>To repeat, get the Pot. </b>I have had about a dozen over the years. I always buy Zojirushi. I have no idea if that is the best. I use a 3-cup and a 10-cup. They make many models and sizes. Have nothing to do with anything "Micom Programmable." Nothing to do with words like "Neuro Fuzzy." No dials or "settings." I am saving us money. What you want is your basic Pot with two speeds: Cook, and Warm. Sometimes it says Hold.</p></blockquote></blockquote><br><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/AunyMary.html" onclick="window.open('http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/AunyMary.html','popup','width=460,height=276,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/AunyMary-thumb-300x180.jpg" width="300" height="180" alt="AunyMary.jpg" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></span><i> <blockquote><blockquote><b> Aunt Mary's graduation class.

<p></p>

<p><b> You can skip this paragraph. </b> If you click on the photos of Pots, you go to Amazon and I get a percentage. I am not going into the rice cooker business. Go to Amazon yourself. Search for "rice cooker," and you will find 443 choices. There is one for $8.99, but you have to put it in a microwave. That's where they get you. I found a Black &amp; Decker 3-cup for $19.99. Haven't tried it. Nor the Salton or the Aroma, but they look okay in their photos. I linked to the 10-cup Panasonic for a little variety. There is a 10-cup Zojirushi. There is even a 20-cup Zojirushi, if you are the Soup Nazi. We are still using a 3-cup Zojirushi our assistant, Carol Iwata, gave us as a wedding present 17 years ago. It has gone to Sundance with me. This is the bottom line: Get the Pot.</p></p>

<p>	Amazon has rice cooker cookbooks. We don't want no stinking cookbooks. Whatever your gender, you will do this like a man, by refusing to read the instructions. Or a woman like my Aunt Mary, who copied down and traded recipes for a lifetime, and never used a single one. When she was in the kitchen, she was on automatic. She had two speeds: Cook, and Serve. She did not <i>know </i> how to measure salt. "Just throw in about enough, honey," she told me. I believe I have mentioned before her poetic wisdom about how to estimate the number of potatoes sufficient for a meal.</p>

<blockquote><i><b> One potato<br />
	For every member of the family.<br />
	One potato for the pot.<br />
	And one last tater, honey,<br />
	For fear of later company. </b></i> </blockquote></i></b> 

<p>	We are her kind of cook. We try. We learn. We experiment. When we have absorbed the principle of the Pot, we will find ourselves day-dreaming new combinations. Can you cook potatoes in the Pot? Of course you can, and boiled eggs, too. You can cook about everything but a <i> souffle. </i></p>

<p><b> Breakfast good for the rest of your life. </b> Start with oatmeal. I like the stone-ground organic oatmeal. Put in as much as you need, and the specified amount of water. The water is important. I like my oatmeal a little <i> al dente. </i> You may like yours a little softer. With experience you can make <i>small</i> adjustments in the amount of water.</blockquote></blockquote><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/mortar.jpg"><img alt="mortar.jpg" src="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/mortar-thumb-200x214.jpg" width="200" height="214" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></span><i><blockquote><blockquote> <b> Mortar and pestle. <strike> Mortar </strike>Pestle is above. </b> </i></p></p>

<p><br />
<p>	Look for some <i>unground</i> flaxseed. Never mind why unground. Good for you. I'm cooking here and I don't have time to do into endless details. Grind it fresh in a mortar and pestle. You don't have a mortar and pestle? People these days want everything done for them. Do like the Indians did and grind it with the end of a stick in the depression of a boulder. Measure out a generous teaspoon for every serving. There is a plenty good reason for grinding it fresh. Trust me.</p>

<p>Now you have your oatmeal. You can substitute any grain of your choice. Even amarath, seen as the favorite side dish in "The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor." I like to use low-fat Silk soybean milk. Use what you like. Have a small or medium chopping block and a nice knife. Slice into smallish pieces the fruit of your choice. Any fruit except something like watermelon. I shouldn't have to be telling you this. </p>

<p>Slice your bananas, your peaches, your applies, pears, plums, apricots, strawberries, your Kiwi. Throw in your blueberries, your blackberries, your boysenberries, your this berry, your that berry. Drop in maybe a couple dried prunes. No, stupid. Not all the fruits at once. We're making breakfast, not fruit compote. Let's say two fruits together are nice. Bananas and peaches make Peaches 'n Cream. Mmmm! Chaz loves 'em.</p>

<p>	While you're doing this, your oatmeal is already cooking. Figure out the hard way when to add the fruit to the Pot so it tastes the best and doesn't get all boiled to death on you. Okay. Fruit's in. Slam the lid back down. Cook, click, and Warm. It will wait there for you a long time. Find out the hard way what's too long. If the result looks like a potato pancake, that was too long. On the other hand, you can make a sortofa half-assed potato pancake, although not crisp on the bottom, that way. You can even start with instant potatoes, if you are a fool. Chop in some onions on the far turn. Throw in onions, peppers and mushrooms, and when they're thundering down the home stretch, some stirred-up eggs, and you have what down home we call Skillet.</p></p>

<p><b> Now you have mastered the Pot. </b> Every recipe works the same way. By trial and error, you learn to adjust the amount of water, for example to steam spinach versus steaming broccoli. And you will learn how to monitor the Pot when you're making something like soup, which you don't want to cook all the way down.</blockquote></blockquote><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/popeye.jpg"><img alt="popeye.jpg" src="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/popeye-thumb-120x129.jpg" width="120" height="129" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></span><blockquote><blockquote><b><i>I'm strong to the finich, 'cause I eats me spinach. </i></b> </i></p>

<p><br />
	<b> Let's make some soup. </b>Assemble your ingredients. Throw them in the pot. Add enough water to make it soup. I have been known to start with a can of Health Valley or Pritkin soup and add fresh ingredients. I have also been known to start with Health Valley chili and add ground beef, spices, and a small chopped onion late in the day, Slam down the lid. This watched Pot boils. Click to Warm when the soup looks about right. If it looks undercooked, add a little more water and keep going. You will also learn to add the ingredients in a mixture in the reverse order of how long you think they'll take to cook. For example, dried beans first. Even let them sit in water and Warm for awhile. If you're in a hurry, throw them in and boil them. The hell with them. Never put in meat and chicken so soon it will overcook. There are no rules. You are Aunt Mary. The last ingredients into the Pot should be the things you like still a little crunchy, like frozen peas and corn. </p></p>

<p><b> Stews.</b> Like soup only with less water, Albert Einstein.</p>

<p>	<b> Your ingredients, </b> (1) Any meat. Lamb, pork, beef, chicken, goat, wild boar, minotaur, hot dogs, ground beef. Cut into bite-sized pieces. (2) Fish, you have to be careful not to overcook. Canned tuna is useful.  Use chilled shrimp, but don't let it cook until it gets too tough. Delicate fish, wait to read my salmon recipe. (3) Vegetable protein. Slice up tofu bite-sized. Try textured soy protein, which comes pretending to be beef chunks, chicken chunks, hamburger. (4) Vegetables. Just about any and all, but use your common sense. Don't try to cook a whole head of cabbage. You can cut it into wedges and steam it. Easier, use Brusells sprouts. Obvious principles: Carrots take longer than peppers. (5) Grains and pastas. Any and all. Experiment. With some, you'll want to cook them a little before adding anything else. (6) Salt, pepper and oils. Use all the pepper(s) you like. Otherwise, see below. 

<p>	<b> Your spices. </b> Earlier, I <strike>carefully avoided mentioning</strike> didn't emphasize that I want to put you on a low salt, low fat diet. This is up to you. Throw in salt by the handful if you want to. Aunt Mary would get nervous: "Don't you think that's about enough?" Hell, I don't care. Take a good look at that microwave oatmeal you've been eating. It's loaded with salt, corn syrup, palm oil and coconut oils--the two deadliest oils on earth. But it's high fiber, you say? Terrific. You can die of a heart attack during a perfect bowel movement. Use oils very sparingly. Even my pals at Pritikin say you can use a little olive oil. That means a<i> little</i>, Chef Boy-ar-Dee.</p></blockquote></blockquote><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/leapr.jpg"><img alt="leapr.jpg" src="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/assets_c/2008/11/leapr-thumb-200x294.jpg" width="200" height="294" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></span><blockquote><blockquote></p>

<p>	<b> Other herbs and spices. </b> Any and all, especially fresh ones like basil. Dried ones, rub them between your palms. Or use your elbow to grind them on the boulder. You don't want to be tasting stick. 

<p>	<b><i> The Original Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire Sauce. </i></b>No oil. Very low salt. </p>

<p>You know how Lea and Perrins invented it? They owned the chemist shop in Worcestershire. A colonel in the British army came home from serving the Raj, and told them about a great sauce he had tasted in India. John Wheeley Lea and William Henry Perrins worked together with great care to assemble the correct ingredients. They left them to ferment in a barrel down in the cellar. The colonel never came home again from India. Three years later, Lea &amp; Perrins remembered the barrel, but they couldn't remember what they put into it. So, they invented Worcestershire Sauce. It is still made in the original factory on Midlands Road. The neighbors smell like Bloody Marys.</p><br />
<p></p>

<p>	<b> Marie Sharp's Exotic Sauce.</b> Made in Belize, the former British Honduras. You were thinking of Grenada.  Cooked up first in the kitchen by Marie and her family, now by 20 employees who are like family. No salt. No oil. A little spicy and and very delicious. Ingredients: fresh green mangoes, tamarind, raisins, ginger, sugar, vinegar, onions, garlic, Habanero peppers and spices. Sold in stores and on the Web. Marie makes a lot of hot sauces, but the Exotic Sauce does not alarmingly claim to remove spots from your driveway. Worcestershire and Marie Sharp's Exotic are the two best steak sauces in the world. Sometimes I get to the point where a add a little Worcestershire, Marie Sharp's or Saigon Sizzle to everything. </p>

<p>Then I remember that nothing whets the appetite like the smell of curry cooking. However, there is strictly speaking no such thing as "curry powder." You can purchase the constituent ingredients and combine according to taste. You will have noticed I do not recommend cooking steaks in the Pot. That would be a bad idea. Cook them over a fire on your boulder. </blockquote></blockquote><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/mariesharp.jpg"><img alt="mariesharp.jpg" src="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/mariesharp-thumb-200x142.jpg" width="200" height="142" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></a></span><i> <b> Marie Sharp invented one of the two best steak sauces in the world. </b></i><b> </b></p><p><blockquote><blockquote></p>

<b> House of Tsang Saigon Sizzle Sauce. </b> Contains some salt and oil. Use it when you go crazy mad. I do, several times a week. A nice addition to a stir-fry. How do you stir-fry in the Pot? You don't. Combine the ingredients of your stir-fry and Pot them. Much lower oil that way. Start with rice or the grain of your choice, let it cook awhile, then throw in whatever you want in your stir-fry. Animal or vegetable protein, onions, peppers, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, baby corn, anything. Also try Sweet &amp; Sour sauce (and throw in some pineapple chunks) or Peanut Sauce (and throw in some soy nuts). A few drops of sesame oil add aroma. I like to stir in some frozen peas at the last moment, and let them cook on the way to the table. </p>

<p>There are countless other sauces. These are mine. There are countless combinations of grains and foods. You will be full, healthy and happy. You will become the center of attention when you claim you can cook almost anything in the Pot. Take it from me. I put it in my Who's Who entry, and it has added immeasurably to my aura of mystery and intrigue. </p>

                    <p>You have intrigued me with your tales of the Pot. I think I know what I want for Christmas this year. I have never used a slow rice cooker, but I put wear and tear on my crockpot every winter. Warms up the kitchen and cooks dinner for me--what's not to love? <br />
 I know a great fudgey "cake" recipe for the crockpot--I wonder if it'll work in the Pot? </p>

<p>Here's the recipe: Note to readers:</p>

<p>Cooking time is about 2 and 1/2 hours. </p>

<p>Cake<br />
1 cup all purpose flour (I have no idea if oat flour would work-interesting to try)<br />
1/2 cup sugar<br />
2 Tbs baking cocoa (ie unsweetened)<br />
2 tsps baking powder<br />
1/2 tsp salt<br />
1/2 cup milk (I use skim)<br />
2 Tbs vegetable oil<br />
1 tsp vanilla<br />
1/2 cupped chopped nuts </p>

<p>Syrup/sauce<br />
3/4 cup packed brown sugar<br />
1/4 cup baking cocoa<br />
1 and 1/2 cups hot water</p>

<p>Chocolate chips/toffee bits/dried cherries/whatever</p>

<p><br />
Spray the inside of your slow cooker. Mix first 5 ingredients in a bowl. Stir in next 3 and mix until smooth. Add nuts. Spread batter in cooker.</p>

<p>Mix syrup ingredients together until sugar is dissolved. Pour evenly over batter. Cover and cook on HIGH for 2-21/2 hours or until toothpick comes out clean. Turn cooker off and let stand--now is the time to add the choc chips or toffee etc and stir once. Spoon extra "sauce" or syrup over serving. </p>

<p>Great with ice cream. </p>

<p><b> Ebert: I don't think that's going to work in the Pot. In fact, I think it could catch on fire, and fill the house with the smell we get on cold winter nights all over Chicago's Loop when the Tootsie Roll factory fires up. </b></p>

                    <p>My god, this is a priceless entry for someone who fits TWO of your categories, college student and solitary writer. All the better because you posted this just as I was beginning to panic about my current extreme need to save money feeding myself. And what's more, you threw in witticisms and references, right down to Saul Bellow! For real, this post was crucial, thank you.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Ebert,</p>

<p>It seems to me that the rice cooker way of life you endorse would be perfect for the stars of the documentary "Cinemaniacs."  Makes sense, since it was developed by a borderline cinemaniac (I mean that in the best sense, of course).  Also, Werner Herzog could probably have used these techniques to make that leather shoe a little bit more digestible, no?  Thanks so much for the years of reviews and the new joys of the blog.  Happy rice cookering!</p>

                    <p>Wow, this is a surprise. I never thought you had this side to you. Never seemed the cooking type.</p>

<p>I'm a girl living with a single mother, so I always had to know how to cook for myself. It's really a must. How can anyone survive on take out or eating out forever?</p>

<p>Maybe your post will have a good impact on men who didn't know how to use the pot before. One can only hope!</p>

                    <p>Food is the universal solvent for disolving the uneasiness during any social situation, its what brings people together, since its very nature is one of survival and personal exchange. Nowadays, in a world of packaged, nutrition deficient goodness, rice seems to be universal because you can make it with anything, eat it with anything, share it with anybody; its also quite healthy.</p>

<p>Personally, I was never big on gourmet food. While I've never had a personal chef like the wealthy or the famous, I think I can safely say I'd prefer ordinary comfort food to anything else.</p>

<p>Back when I was in the military, I never really enjoyed eating out often. When I would go to parties with friends or social gatherings, there would often be an abundance of the same old finger sandwhiches, rubbery meats or frozen vegetables (You can tell the difference between fresh and fake-no matter how fancy the presentation).</p>

<p>When I was deployed to Iraq, our plane had to make an emergency stop, since our jet was leaking fuel right out of the sky! We stopped in Frankfurt and were thankfully placed in a five-star hotel. We were given wonderful food, fresh fish, gourmet breads, ice-cream and even your dreaded caviar. Despite being very tasty, I think I'd still prefer eating a large pizza or just rice with some fish or fried chicken fingers. Its not that I'm underprivelaged in the mind, its simply because I know my own memories, and the memories of most people do not come from butlers serving you the greatest dishes this side of the orient express. We'd all like to believe we'd prefer fancy cuisine all the time, truth is, most of us just like a good old fashioned home cooked meal.</p>

<p>A rice pot is probably one of the best inventions out there, it sure made my life a whole lot easier. Most of the best meals I've had around the world came complete with a pot of rice.</p>

<p>One of the best meals I ever had was in Thailand, I had stopped along side a country road near the outside of Udorn, just a short distance from Bangcock. This little house on the side of the road was owned by a very old couple. The husband was a fisherman and his wife was this wonderful cook. Their restaurant consisted of mainly a counter which oversaw their living space, a small little Coke machine hanging near the side of a register (I wish I could remember the address). On their menu, was but one humble item: Enormous Jumbo Shrimp which they lightly sprinked with a touch a fresh lemon from their tree, sautaying them lightely. That's it. It would practically melt in your mouth. Best, freshest meal I've ever had. Beat that, John Travolta and your gourmet chef.</p>

                    <p>Ebert, I could not love your blog any more than I do. I clicked on the link expecting some dry reference from a pot to...I don't know, the latest Kevin Smith movie, and was surprised, hesitant, disappointed, humored, and then informed. I think I'm actually gonna go out and get one of these things now. </p>

                    <p>I thought this was a really interesting post! I kept waiting for some connection to a movie or for it to flow in some other way away from cooking, but it just kept on it! I don't have any recipes to suggest or anything, but I wanted to say that I thought that this kind of writing would make a great cookbook. Nice and loose, with just enough information to get one going but not so much as to glorify the authors knowledge. It was like you were glad to give the information, but didn't really have any interest in repeating it. If you missed it the first time, it's your own fault. Very compelling, good stuff!</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Ebert,</p>

<p>Whatever Studs Terkel meant to your generation as the greatest American writer, one whose words filled your heart with joy, one whose words you eagerly anticipated reading; whatever Studs meant to you, Mr. Ebert, I can say without hesitation that you mean that to my generation.</p>

<p>While I don't particularly enjoy going to movies often, I do turn to your website most days to read what you have to say about them. I learn so much from your reviews, because they go so far beyond the movie being reviewed. And now your blog extends that wonderful writing and great sense of perception to, well, everything from Studs Terkel to The Pot. That the above blog, about a simple rice pot, held my interest and made me smile is a great testament to your profound brilliance as a writer.</p>

<p>Thank you. Bless you. May you live well and write for many, many more years to come.</p>

                    <p>I love my cheap, $12.99, rice cooker. My eldest daughter has celiac disease and cannot eat traditional pastas and breads, so we live by our rice cooker and bread maker. We eat rice four days a week and I would die without it. Cut up some pork strips, add some gluten free cream of mushroom soup, put it on top the rice, add some green beans and a spinach salad with carrots and cucumber, a drizzle of Italian dressing ( also gluten free)- voila- dinner for four for less than $20.</p>

<p>BTW, you'd be surprised how much of our food uses gluten as a binding agent. Half the stuff we used to eat is no longer allowed in my house. </p>

                    <p>My wife and I got married two years ago and out of the few wedding gifts that were NOT towels, we ended up with a rice cooker.  It was a Black and Decker 16-cup rice cooker (model RC426).  We followed the instructions and the thing just ended up making a mess.  It spewed water all over the place and there was so much steam that it made the cabinets wet.  Was I doing something wrong?  Or is this like microwave popcorn where you really can't trust the instructions?</p>

<p>We haven't used it since, it's been sitting in the corner of our dining room amid the stuff we will donate to Good Will while I agonize over the decision to give it to the poor and have them inherit the same problem I had.</p>

<p>Our old manner of cooking rice was in a metal pot that we use on the stove.  It doesn't gauge itself but it sure makes less of a mess.</p>

<p><b> Ebert: Shouldn't be one drop of spew. You were pranked by your friend. Never read the instructions. This blog entry is all you need. The instructions even tell you: "CAUTION! Do not cook anything but rice in this cooker!" Yeah, like the Pot gives a damn. The bastards are just trying to sell you some other pot. </b></p>

                    <p>Dear Roger, sorry for putting this here, but I feel that I must comment about Erica Jong's seemingly paranoiac view on the election. The article by Michael Powell, "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/01/us/politics/01angst.html">Obama Is Up, and Fans Fear That Jinxes It</a>," appearing in The New York Times on October 31, may show some light into this behavior.</p>

<p>I call on my American friends, regardless of race or political convictions, to maintain levelheadedness throughout these last days of the election, <b>and beyond</b>. I exhort my American friends, from Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain to the hoi polloi, to truly grapple with the issues at hand and be responsible, because the way we outsiders see the U.S., she is in deep and dire, not to mention farcical, mess. A mess ranging from <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/pena/?articleid=13684">the size of the U.S. national debt</a> to the blood of the innocents that have spilled due to <a href="http://www.vdare.com/roberts/080523_war.htm">belligerence borne out of dubious and/or misguided ideals</a>. If Bertie Wooster were here, I can imagine him saying, "Can you imagine how ridic your posish is?" If these problems are left untended, what then will your <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080821/REVIEWS/329">posterity</a> say about this generation?</p>

<p>Uphold the true spirit of democracy, and put the country first before bigotry or partisanship.</p>

<p>It spewed water all over the place? Sounds like you've put too much water into the rice (although, I have to say that it does that sometimes, even under normal circumstances.) Also, did you wash the rice first until clear (about three times)? As a personal rule, the volume of rice you put into the cooker is also the volume of water, and a bit more, you use to cook it in. Or, be sure to only use the measuring cup that came with your cooking gadget. And yes, it's supposed to steam and wet the cabinets. I put mine under the kitchen exhaust fan.</p>

                    <p>Regarding your conundrum:</p>

<p>Minute Rice is a brand of parboiled rice. It takes less time to cook because it has already been boiled in the husk. I have never cooked whole grain organic rice, but I believe it hasn't be parboiled. Because Minute Rice has already been boiled in the husk, it takes less time for the rice to become saturated; I imagine that this is not the case with whole grain organic rice. Once the rice is saturated and the residual water has boiled away, the temperature of the rice exceeds the boiling point, thus tripping the thermostat in the rice cooker--the rice cooker then switches to "Warming". Since it takes less time for the Minute Rice to become saturated, it achieves the "Warming" state faster than the whole grain organic rice. Of course, that's just one theory. Personally, I'm a fan of the Intelligent Pot.</p>

                    <p>Robert in Taiwan: you are truly a wise man. :-)</p>

<p>And Mr. Ebert, apologies in advance but I have to ask: what's your fave rice cooker recipe for chili?</p>

<p>(If it's not too far off topic, long as we're talking food: I'd also ask what your favorite place is in Illinois for Chicago Dogs. Here in Long Beach CA we have a great place called Mustard's that makes 'em with Vienna Beef dogs, and they're terrific, but I can only imagine how mindblowing they are in your hometown.)</p>

<p><b> Ebert: Just how you'd figure: Beans, ground or chunk beef or vegetable protein, onions, garlic, maybe some peppers, maybe some bacon, maybe some cocoa powder, tomatoes or try stewed tomatoes (bigger tomato chunks cut up), and chili powder, garam masala or the peppers of your choice. </b></p>

                    <p>Did you know that the Pot is now the "in" thing with the gourmet set? In "sous vide" cookery, one vacuum-seals a protein (steak, fish, egg) and submerges it in water kept very precisely at the desired final temperature. Leave the protein in for an hour, two hours, or a weekend, and the result is still perfectly-cooked. A steak, medium rare, from the surface to the core, all the same shade of pink, AND ANYWAYS, I digress: </p>

<p>The pro-chef implementation of this idea is an "immersion circulator", which immerses and circulates water and I don't know anything more than that except that it costs $10,000. </p>

<p>The home-chef implementation is a doohickey that one plugs the Pot into that keeps water in the Pot very precisely at a desired final temperature. </p>

<p>I don't know if "molecular gastronomers" have yet repurposes the boulder and the stick, but there's a whole future ahead of us, so I have high hopes.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Ebert,</p>

<p>I never watch a movie without first reading your review.  I feel the same way you do about 99 percent of the time regarding movies, I just love how you put my feelings into words, and often read your reviews out loud to my fiance or my children.</p>

<p>I've just found your blog... and have been seriously contemplating purchasing a rice cooker for some time.  Now I know what I will be asking for for christmas!</p>

<p>I can't believe you love House of Tsang sauce as much as I do!  I have never found anyone else who used the sauce other than those I've turned on to it.  I absolutely LOVE their spicy schezuan stir fry sauce and when it is on sale, will buy 10 bottles at a time.  It is very spicy and flavored absolutely perfectly.  I use their classic stir fry sauce for my children's stir fry, as the spicy schezuan is indeed too spicy for them.  I don't care for the saigon sizzle, which you like, as it is too sweet for me, and i only like sweetness in my desserts.  If you like spicy, try the schezuan spicy stir fry if you haven't already... delicious... have you tried it?</p>

<p>My children and I were rear ended in a bad car accident a year ago, and I suffered spinal fractures and other injuries.  I can not presently work, and end up watching more movies than i used to get to, and your reviews mean a LOT to me!</p>

<p>Thank you for all you do... how cool that you have this blog!</p>

                    <p>I have long been a fan of the rice cooker. My stepfather is Japanese-American and I was raised eating rice- from a rice cooker- with just about every meal. I remember seeing ads for instant rice that advertised that it never stuck together, and thinking "that's weird, isn't rice supposed to stick together?" Anyway, when I got my first apartment in college the first appliance I wanted was a rice cooker. It was far more important than a toaster.  That Christmas, my parents got me a Hitachi "chime-o-matic" with an "on" and "warm" setting. That was over 20 years ago, and I've used that very same one several times a week ever since. Unlike the dire warnings you have seen, my instruction booklet actually comes with directions for steaming veggies! (Mine has a little steamer insert that is basically a little raised disk with holes, that goes in the bottom before you add veggies and water). I have to admit, I have never tried cooking a protein in it. I will have to try that! I wonder if you could start with the flash-frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts, or if you'd need to thaw them first? </p>

                    <p>You're probably better off buying a Japanese rice cooker. I bought some off-brand I never heard of, and it broke after I used it six times. So I bought a Panasonic, and it's five years old and going strong. I just gave it to my oldest daughter when she moved out.</p>

                    <p>I own both a rice cooker and a crock pot.  I use the rice pot for steaming things. Since I  am a vegetarian who borders close to vegan, I make "faux" meats. Snausages, veg patties, kielbasa, that sort of stuff. I am going to try to make seiten this week in prep for Thanksgiving. Tofurkey's are at least an hours drive for me and I need to feed at least 8, 7 of whom are omnivores. I cook no animal flesh so this will be most interesting. Otherwise, I will need to ship them all to Frankenmuth and sit myself home to watch the NBA alone (works for me!).</p>

<p>I have horrible insomnia. Have for years. Since nothing seems to work (circadian clock lights, night time or pain meds, tens unit (for the Fibro),  I chose treatment of either  paper crafting until I have decorated the dogs with glitter and ink or cooking. My pot gets all the leftovers that are showing sure signs of impending death like wilting and shriveling and into the pot they go. Soups, stews, chowders, pasta melanges, all get made in large servings, some to freeze, some were sent to hub's inner circle at GM and some I took uptown and left at various places. After 36 years of living with sofa slug, I am only on my second Crockpot and my rice pot is still the one. Crockpot has 3 settings, high, low and warm. Ricer has high, low or steam. I grow my own herbs in the laundry room using an Aerogrow in winter and outside in summer in pots on deck. All veggies and fruits are organic.  Hub retired on October 31 (the trick is on me, I guess) and he is already on my nerves. There is no one to test my recipes  anymore (those souls at GM were most accommodating). My brownies were made with black beans and instant coffee, desserts without any refined  sugars, Italian sausage (animal free) with home made sun roasted tomatoes. All from using the crock or rice pot. If only I c0uld find a way to make tofu or soy milk in them. Any recipes or ideas peeps?  I will trade you for one sofa snoring blob who thinks we can live the same on 40% less. And he is a math whiz??</p>

<p>What's this I read about rinsing the rice 3 times? Is that before or after cooking? I've never rinsed rice in my life. I'm a streamlined, prep-to-table better be at most an hour kind of girl. Rinse rice? What say you, O Rice Guru? </p>

                    <p>Just one question--when you are pulling off your culinary feats,where on your person,do you hide Remy?!...anyway, when i tried the rice cooker adventure inspired by you, imagine my surprise when the first spoonful suddenly made my mind zoom back to the good ole days when i staggered home bone-tired from hectic play and mom would comfort with a ready plate of thumping good grains!<br />
   you may also be interested to know that rice cookers and Indian films have a faithful connection..last year i watched a pale derivative of 'Lolita' starring the famous Amitabh Bacchan,and in one sequence,the errant husband tries to make conversation with his wife in the kitchen--she's silent but the rice cooker gives off a aggressive hiss!..i thought this was a neat idea until a critic pointed out that this was cliched usage!</p>

                    <p>How great to see your post! I run a hotel front desk at night and go to school, and my little rice Pot has been my best friend for years. Lack of money, time, space, energy, or ideas - if you have the rice pot, you're good to go. I have carried it across country and back multiple times in multiple cars and it's become one of my most cherished possessions. Cheers!</p>

<p>My grandmother could do that, and so could all the rest of the women in my family.  They couldn't actually explain to anyone how they cooked what they cooked -- they just cooked it.  I have to wonder whether this is an art that will die with the generation that lived through the Depression.</p>

                    <p>   I know a trick that eliminates bad after taste in foods, that is when you throw food in wherever you cook.  Season the oil, but its kind of hard if you put very little, but basically, if you have any liquid ingredients like oil or water, mix all your spices in it and stir it and stir it.  </p>

<p>   Part of the trick that I like to do is when I first grab something, I toss it up and catch it twice and then let it fall in out of my hands as a third toss.  If it is water, (and water travels altogether so gets no airtime), I will carefully toss up the container of water and ingredients two times (don't fill up the water more than half unless you are prepared to clean it), and then on the third toss just let the water come out in drops out of the container so every drop gets some air time (letting water come out on drops also makes easier to clean something when doing dishes).  Why does it have to be three tosses?  Well, It probably doesn't, but throwing it in the pot with your hip and a snap probably would help.  But I do it because of kind of the coriolis effect (where something touches first depends on where its going to go--food tends to want to slip out the spot your first touch it) and kind of physics.  When I was messing about playing pool, I wanted to keep spinning the ball around...I spin the pool ball one way, then I spun it the opposite way, then I spun it again the other way (hard to do) and you notice the ball takes a kind of straight trajectory on the third hit, (yes, common sense), but I just like to do a one, two, three toss because of it, So, it's kind of a mix of common sense physics and being mindful of the exact spot where your hand first touches your ingredients and the containers they are in...I usually put the ingredients in a big plastic bowl when tossing around the ingredients.  I did the one, two, three toss when I was a cook at a chicken place and within ten seconds there would be customers piling in the store...don't do that though, the grease is hot, but it did earn me bonuses which is something that doesn't usually happen at fast food.</p>

                    <p>Pot Overflow:  Anybody who uses pot regulary would have atleast experienced the overflowing pot once. <br />
This phenomenon is mostly seen with new users or users who try to use a 3 cup pot to prepare a thanksgiving dinner for kith and kin. The first time it happens it is quite tense experience.  It is an ugly and messy sight.</p>

<p> Do you the exact amount of rice and water to add to your pot, such that  the rice, when it is fully, cooked just pushes the lid up without the rice or water spilling over. Until you know this, you don't know your pot !!!!! And you better know your pot.</p>

                    <p>Scary coincidence. I'm doing my best to eat healthier and I use two crock pots as part of that effort - a 4-qt Rival I got in college 27 years ago, and a newer 7-qt Hamilton for when I know I won't be able to cook for several days. To avoid the hassle of cooking rice properly, I've been buying frozen organic brown rice, and want to economize.  So I was looking at rice cookers, trying to decide which to buy.  Then my parents called me and told me they just bought themselves a rice cooker and they think it is amazing. So now they have bought me one, just yesterday.  And then I bring up your blog and this is posted.  Freaky.</p>

<p>They got me the 3-cup Black & Decker but I suspect I will soon graduate to Zojirushi.  I have a couple of sizes of their thermos - after 2 decades my older one still looks like new, and those things keep coffee as hot at 3pm as it was at 8am. They know what they are doing.  I haven't developed any rice cooker recipes yet, but if you keep a space open here, I bet I will soon.  As for fast-grinding those flaxseeds to a beautiful and consistent texture that you control - buy a $10 coffeegrinder (Krups is fine) to use specifically for that.  Mark it so your oatmeal doesn't end up tasting like coffee, Mensa candidate.</p>

<p>By the way, I will reveal my vote: I like your title for the book.</p>

                    <p>Whew, not talking is one thing, but not eating is another thing entirely.  I of course violently disagree with you, I think Pritikin is a lunatic.  Women in particular need good fats (and that includes coconut oil) for great libido.  Fish fat is the best, of course, but saturated fats like steak, butter, cheese are also good, and don't be mingy with the olive oil!  40/30/30, that's what I say!  And with that 40% of calories from carbs, half those carbs should be fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>I know what I'm talking about, I already have written a book on food, a somewhat popular one.  Tofu is an abomination.  Trans fats are poisonous and polyunsaturated fats should be avoided.  </p>

<p>If a person gets lots of omega-3s, worrying about good dietary fat and salt is much less of a health issue.  When young ladies come to me asking about low libido, the first thing I ask is are they vegetarians eating lots of whole grains.  Saturated fat is good for testosterone levels.</p>

<p>My crockpot recipe--a couple pounds of fatty stew meat.  Get two bottles of good beer, I like Killian's Red.  Pour one into the crockpot, drink the other.  Plenty of salt and some pepper, a spoon of tomato paste, and lots of fresh thyme, maybe seven sprigs.  Mix the ingredients in the beer, add stew meat.  Chop up a red onion and mix in.  Layer of chopped carrots, another layer of chopped celery.  Turn on crockpot and let cook overnight.  In the morning, make some Japanese sushi rice, maybe in your rice cooker, and then ladle plenty of the stew over it when it's done, and you've got a great lunch to bring to work for the next week, just keep making fresh rice every morning.</p>

<p>Can the magic fairies who bring you sustenance add some fish oil?  Perhaps not with your health situation, fish oil can thin the blood and it interacts with various drugs.  But I'd be curious.  :)  </p>

I don't use the pot anymore, but have fond memories of it from my university days.  The smells that emanated during the actual process of using the pot were only countered by the rapturous delight of consuming what the pot had produced.</p>

<p>These days I use a pressure cooker.  Admittedly, not as much fun, but it is what it is.</p>

<p>Finally, I especially liked the initial recommendation of the pot to various and sundry at the top of this entry.  Alas, no mention of tinker, tailor, soldier, spy.  Or, in fact, butcher, baker, candlestick maker...<br />

                    <p>Dear Roger,</p>

<p>The taut atmosphere of this journal entry reminds me of the film "The Petrified Forest" with Leslie Howard, Bette Davis, and Humphrey Bogart.  As you know, a group of hostages are awaiting their fate at a diner in the middle of the desert with widely dissimilar preoccupations and degrees of apprehension.</p>

<p>Thank you to Robert of Taiwan and Vijay for sending words of encouragement to us.</p>

<p>Robert, Even Bertie Wooster would be a welcome house guest this weekend, purely from the distraction posish.<br />

The Zen of the pot by Vijay</p>

<p> ...such that the rice, when it is fully cooked, just pushes the lid up without the rice or water spilling over.  Until you know this, you don't know your pot!</p>

                    <p>Besides cooking up oatmeal, soups, and stews, how about using the rice cooker to poach fish or eggs?  Maybe adding a small colander or folding metal basket might enable the rice cooker to work as a steamer, too.  Would be interesting to see if it's possible to steam cook a cake or quiche.</p>

                    <p>Jerry: I've had luck putting a handtowel over the little hole in the top of the Pot while it cooks. Keeps down spatter, but lets out enough steam to cook the rice anyway. (After it switches to "warm" you should certainly do this to keep the nice warm moist air in.) Also you might be trying to cook too much rice. I never fill mine more than halfway, mostly.</p>

<p>The more expensive Pots, I learned in Japan, are pretty amazing devices. They're all sorts of magic--they can do the "how do I know your rice is done? <i>you</i> never know when your rice is done..." trick, as well as the make-rice-in-the-morning-and-it's-still-sticky-and-warm-for-dinner trick. It's majestic.</p>

<p>For tangy sticky sushi-style rice:<br />
Rinse white short-grain rice carefully. The water should be clear, and long-grain rice is for communists.<br />
Add a little (maybe a third by volume) more water than rice. Let it soak for a good half hour or so.<br />
Cook in the Pot.<br />
While the Pot goes, prepare a solution of approx. five parts rice vinegar, one part sugar, and a bit of salt. Call it a third of a cup total for 2-3 cups of rice. Microwaves can help with this, or you can cleverly harness steam from the Pot to assist dissolution.<br />
Remove the rice to a large shallow bowl-like thing. Have a friend fan the rice while you drizzle vinegar concoction and gently turn the rice. (Fanning helps with the stickiness.)</p>

<p>Delicious!</p>

<p>Extra fun:<br />
- Add (low sodium? perhaps.) soy sauce and wasabi for a cheap cheap cheap alternative to waiting in line at a sushi restaurant. All you really wanted was the soy sauce and wasabi, right?<br />
- Make rice balls! you can put things inside them. I suggest using a piece of saran wrap to keep your hands clean if you're making more than a few. Make a hole with the thumb to insert fillings--lox, tuna, maybe something sweet, bits of pickle, anything.<br />
- For added points shape your riceball into a fat triangle and wrap with seaweed. Eat while the nori is crispy.<br />
- (Rice balls are notoriously hard to keep more than a day; they dry out in the fridge very quickly. I've had some limited luck microwaving them a bit.)</p>

<p>More Pot!</p>

<p><b><i>A.) For the rice</i></b><br />
1.) 1/2 (rice cooker measuring) cup of glutinous rice﹝糯米﹞<br />
2.) 3 1/2 (rice cooker measuring) cup of ordinary rice<br />
3.) one handful of dried shitake mushrooms, the small variety. If large ones, scissor to strips<br />
4.) half white onion, slice into half-rings<br />
5.) 2 cloves garlic, squashed<br />
6.) 3/4 (rice cooker measuring) cup of soy sauce<br />
7.) 3 tbsps of soy sauce<br />
8.) 2 tbsps oil<br />
9.) 4 1/2 (rice cooker measuring) cups of water</p>

<p><b><i>B.) For the chicken</i></b><br />
1.) 1 thin slice of ginger, cut into thin strips<br />
2.) one handful of chicken pieces, nibble size, preferably thighs and deboned<br />
3.) 2 tbsps soy sauce<br />
4.) 2 tbsps oil</p>

<p><br />
<b>PROCEDURE:</b><br />
1.) Wash glutinous rice and soak thoroughly in water for half an hour. Put aside.<br />
2.) Soak dried shitake mushrooms in 3/4 cup soy sauce. Put aside (soak until soft).<br />
3.) In a non-stick pan, heat 2 tbsps oil, then saute ginger. Quickly add in chicken pieces with 2 tbsps of soy sauce (to give chicken color). Stir-fry until chicken is cooked. Set aside on a plate and let cool thoroughly, this is important.<br />
-----</p>

<p>4.) Drain glutinous rice of water. Wash ordinary rice clean and drain of water, too. Remember to drain both rice well.<br />
5.) Using hand, squeeze shitake mushrooms of soy sauce, but mind that you do not waste the soy sauce because it will be used afterwards. <br />
6.) In the selfsame non-stick pan, heat 2 tbsps of oil. Saute garlic, then the onion, and then the mushrooms.<br />
7.) Put in all the rice, the glutinous and the ordinary, and also the 3 tbsps of soy sauce. Stir fry until rice is evenly coated with oil and soy. Don't take too long in stir-frying the rice (less than a minute).<br />
-----</p>

<p>8.) Pour your rice mixture and the chicken into your rice cooker. Pour in 4 1/2 (rice cooker measuring) cups of water. Also pour in the soy sauce that you used to soak your dried shitake mushrooms.<br />
9.) A bit dash of salt (only a teeny bit) and MSG (skip MSG if undesired).<br />
10.) Let stand to cool for about 5 minutes or more, all the while stirring to dissipate the heat. Dissipating the heat is important so as not to mess with the gauging system of your cooker.<br />
-----</p>

<p>11.) After cooling, begin to cook the usual way in your rice cooker.</p>

<p><br />
<b>TIPS:</b><br />
1.) Remember that by 'cup,' I refer to the plastic measuring cup that came along with your rice cooker.<br />
2.) My father liked to add taro bits into this recipe. This is optional. You may also try canned water chestnuts.<br />
3.) Add only a little salt for reasons that are already obvious.<br />
4.) If you don't have chicken meat, use 1 chicken cube (bouillon cube). <br />
5.) Too much glutinous rice <b>CAUSES</b> indigestion and constipation. Use only small amounts as I do here, and drink plenty of water.<br />
6.) Different brands of soy sauce produce different tastes. It is not advisable to use the Kikoman brand as I cannot vouch for the resulting taste, but use the ones that come from Taiwan. These I can vouch. Remember not to be fooled into buying soy sauce paste. There is a distinction between soy sauce and soy sauce paste.<br />
7.) This recipe is actually easier than it looks. </p>

                    <p>Well, this is all...faintly hallucinatory. Unfortunately, in the present if-not-depressed-then-at-least-increasingly-dispirited economic climate, purchasing something like a rice cooker is probably out of the question, especially for an impoverished Englishman who's never even seen £1000 in his life. It'll have to be an old-fashioned, insentient Western saucepan I'm afraid.</p>

                    <p>I am Spanish, but in thirty-seven years the secret of how to cook rice properly was never revealed to me, so don't ask me about paella. Nevertheless, I managed to get the formula for perfect steamed rice from our grumpy lady teacher of Chinese cooking at the evening classes in Edinburgh. Here it is, for those with as little countertop space that we manage with a couple of stoves and a variety of saucepans carefully stored away:</p>

<p>Rinse the rice well in cold water (we use basmati or jasmine Thai rice). Place it in the bottom of the saucepan (amount of rice proportioned to the size of the saucepan so the rice is about 1 to 2 cm deep) and add enough cold water to submerge the rice under another centimeter of water. COVER. Bring to a simmer, and as soon as the water is about to start boiling, turn the fire down, to the very minimum. KEEP COVERED on this slow fire for 8 min. READY.</p>

<p>I have been reading your website for over fourteen years, from Spain, England and Scotland. I cannot thank you enough for the insights, personal experiences, humour and soul searching that you share. I cherish your movie reviews, as I did the ones by Julian Marias on the Sunday edition of Spanish newspaper ABC. Two true "humanistas" and masterful writers.</p>

<p>PS: It is not so easy to find a voice that speaks to you personally. My other favorite film critic: Jose Luis Guarner, who used to write for Fotogramas.</p>

                    <p>Roger, I buy these organic broccoli florets that come in packs. I take a handful out, wash them a bit, and just throw them on top of my rice while it's on WARM inside the rice cooker (the veggie cooks in about twenty minutes, coming out still green and fresh-looking). Very convenient, no need to steam them separately. I also reheat my overnight viands this way, to take to work as packed lunch, or what we call "bien-dang"﹝便當﹞.</p>

                    <p>Um, Roger..... where did you get minotaur meat for your stew? I tried asking around a Cretan market today , but all I got from the people there were wide-eyed stares of disbelief. One of the vendors even hurled a basket of Rotten Tomatoes at me, opprobriously calling me a "potty" (you know, it's funny that she should use that word....) Of course, a fracas ensued immediately afterwards, and more tomatoes. The whole market was thrown into turmoil.</p>

This chicken has a wonderful blend of tastes.  Not too hot, but a sweet, spicy flavor deep in the liquid.<br />
 <br />
4 chicken thighs (use breasts if you must)<br />
2 sliced andouille sausages (even the packaged ones in the weiner section)<br />
4 star balsamic vinegar, about a half cup (you need the good stuff...pop for it)<br />
maybe 3/4 cup orange juice (don't start tasting yet.  this changes flavors)<br />
sea salt, maybe a table spoon<br />
one bottle mushrooms (i use the fancy ones, but it doesn't matter)<br />
half onion, red, sliced and diced<br />
one tomato, fresh, a little mushy, diced (doesn't matter if mushy, but saves a lost tomato(e?, dan quayle?)<br />
two tablespoons peach preserves</p>

<p>give it time.  you'll know from the aroma when it's done.</p>

<p><b> Ebert: From my favorite Libertarian! You indicate this is for a crock pot. I wonder if it would work in a (large enough) rice Pot it you added the right amount of liquid-- maybe just water, to not throw off the flavor. Singular, tomato. Plural, tomatoes. </b><br />

                    <p>What a wholesome and unexpected treat. Your posting reminded me of a scene from 1973's "Payday," in which the plot is put on the back burner--for a spirited debate on the merits of Teflon! </p>

<p>About 56 minuutes into the movie, the chauffer of country singer Maury Dann (Rip Torn) has a bizarro conversation with Maury's latest groupie, while both wait in the limo for the star that they serve (albeit in different but oddly analogous ways).</p>

<p>It all begins with a seemingly innocent question from the front seat...</p>

<p>"CHICAGO" (Cliff Emmich): Do you like to cook?</p>

<p>ROSAMOND MCCLINTOCK (Elayne Heilveil): What?</p>

<p>CHICAGO: Do you like to cook?</p>

<p>ROSAMOND: Oh, um...well, a little bit. I don't know too much about it.</p>

<p>CHICAGO: Men make the best cooks. So I've heard, anyway. All your chefs are men...all your big chefs.</p>

<p>ROSAMOND: Um, well, I just never learned very much about it. We just mostly ate in restaurants. You know, Colonel Sanders and McDonalds. I swear, I've ate three thousand McDonalds hamburgers--</p>

<p>CHICAGO: (shocked) Doesn't your mother cook for you? </p>

<p>ROSAMOND: (laughs) My momma cook? Lord, she'd rather die!</p>

<p>CHICAGO: (glares at her in stunned, offended silence)</p>

<p>ROSAMOND: (finally, after staring out Cadillac windows) Say, where are we?</p>

<p>CHICAGO: (uncomfortable, quickly changing the subject) Do you like omelettes?</p>

<p>ROSAMOND: Omelettes?</p>

<p>CHICAGO: Sure.</p>

<p>ROSAMOND: Well, I never ate one, I don't think.</p>

<p>CHICAGO: (stares in disbelief) Well, I make good omelettes. It's all in the timing. That and your frying pan. </p>

<p>(At this point, CHICAGO shows off a cast-iron skillet, which he's actually carrying around in the front seat with him.)</p>

<p>(admiringly, lovingly) You look at that old devil, huh? (caressing the skillet) Well, it's black as your Uncle Dick's hatband! You see, the trick is you never wash the pan out. I just wipe out all the trash with a wadded-up paper towel. Although some say you'd be better off with cloth, but I've never had no complaints. </p>

<p>ROSAMOND: Well, it's real nice.</p>

<p>CHICAGO: (smiles in return) </p>

<p>ROSAMOND: Hey, have you ever used one of those...um, uh, non-sticky things? </p>

<p>CHICAGO: (alarmed) Non-sticky? You mean "coated pans"?</p>

<p>ROSAMOND: (nods)</p>

<p>CHICAGO: (angrily) You can't cook eggs on coated pans. They get all brown and crusty. Look, the trick to omelettes is you've got to cook them just until they're done and not one second more. </p>

<p>(looking dejected, angst-ridden) You can't get that kind of timing with a coated pan. You might as well cook on an electric stove.</p>

<p>ROSAMOND: (explaining herself) Well, uh, we sure sell a lot of them, uh, non-sticky things in the dimestore. Hundreds and hundreds.</p>

<p>CHICAGO: (accusingly) Yeah, that's what I mean. Most people don't know how to cook. </p>

<p>ROSAMOND: (trying to defend herself) Say, what are you? Some kind of chef or something? I thought you were a driver.</p>

<p>CHICAGO: (solemnly, after a long pause) Chief cook and bottle washer.</p>

EPILOGUE (Spoiler Alert)<br />
By the film's end, mediocre country singer Maury Dann will be dead, "Chicago" will be arraigned for second-degree murder, and Rosamond McClintock will have been exposed to any number of venereal diseases that plagued the rural South during the early 1970s. The whereabouts of Chicago's skillet remain unknown, to this day.</p>

                    <p>Roger, you know by now that I trust you, right? I've never disagred with your review of a film you've rated as good (although I've liked a few, such as the immortal The Coneheads, that you didn't care for). So I need you to tell me this: Will the pot cook my rice until it's done and then turn off to "warm" where I live, here at nearly 5000 feet above sea-level? If you tell me it will, I promise to order the pot. The only reason I haven't is that I've doubted it would know when rice (or dried beans) are done at this altitude because (if I could phrase this as a question, I would call this a trick question) at this altitude, whole grain rice and dried beans never do finish cooking. I don't want to hassle with a pressure cooker, and I'm a whole-grain kind of gal, so I live with unsatisfactory brown rice and sort of crunchy dried beans. Can you assure me that this miracle device, The Pot, will solve my high altitude cooking problems? </p>

                    <p>When my husband and I first married, 16 years ago, I wanted to buy a rice cooker.  Like the United Nations, we shared veto power and he used it.  (The Swiss don't spend money they don't have.)  But that started me on the path I am on today.  I adapted and even thrived in my quest to grasp the elusive secret of rice cooking.  </p>

<p>When I traveled to Japan, I was the house guest of a very gracious woman who attempted to teach me the secrets of rice cooking, albeit in Japanese, but to no avail.  I carried on with my quest.  Through the years I've attained a certain proficiency to the point where my failures are also satisfying in an odd way.</p>

<p>It has been at least 10 years now that my husband has attempted to buy me a rice cooker on a bi-yearly basis.  It never makes it to the cash register.  I would certainly miss my encounters with the rice, water, fire and salt.  I want to know what the pot knows.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for the Rice Cooker post. I have often wondered the same thing. And why anyone would cook rice on a stovetop now is beyond me, unless he enjoys guessing games.</p>

<p>My favourite rice cooker--oh I wish I had a camera on me at the time--I saw in a Korean grocery store. It looked normal, but was for expensive, for it had a special dial with three or four settings according to type of rice.</p>

<p>I don't quite recall the names of the settings, but for the fourth, the most clockwise:  DELICIOUS.</p>

<p>You can see why I forgot what the earlier settings were.</p>

                    <p>I got one of these a few years ago.  My first thought was "Why the hell didn't I know about these when I was living on Mac-n-Cheese and Ramen Noodles?"</p>

<p>To the people who don't want to risk the money, spend the fifteen or twenty bucks at Target (or K-Mart or whatever).  It's totally worth it.</p>

<p>And I know Ebert already answered the guy who asked what size to get, but the sizes are listed for UNCOOKED rice.  So a 3 cup cooker will have about 9 cups of cooked rice.  Do the math on a 16 cup cooker. Too much rice for a single guy!</p>

<p>I use it to make something resembling my grandmother's gumbo. (mostly it involves small amount of pan-made roux, a few spices that depend on my mood, many canned tomatoes, andouille sausage, frozen okra about halfway through, and then some shrimp at the last minute.) Now I just need another Pot to make the rice to go with it...</p>

<p>I am looking for a white kettle on amazon.com right now to go with the cooker, because the saying about the pot and the kettle does not hold true with the above example.</p>

<p>Also, if you put minute rice is a slow cooker, I think the fabric of time starts to unravel. Not risking it.</p>

                    <p>Loved your peon to the rice cooker.</p>

<p>But the Slow Cooker goes it all one better. It nearly as simple but can do much more.</p>

<p>However the Slow Cooker does have a High and Low setting as well as the Cook and Warm settings. Maybe too complicated?</p>

<p>Stick with the rice cooker if [said in screaming Jack Nicholson voice] YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE SLOW COOKER.</p>

                    <p>I know you said you like to eat in the immediate future. However...have you tried the slow version of The Pot - the Slow Pot? Here's one I use: http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Proctor%20Silex%2033040%204%20qt.%20Round%20Slow%20Cooker:2002405311</p>

<p>It has one more setting than the Pot...warm, low and high (I know!). It takes longer to cook, 8-12 hours on Low or 4-6 hours on High. But fret not, you put everything in the pot before bed and wake up to a full meal. Good things come to those who wait. The Slow Pot is just like the Pot...but cooks slower, using lower heat, to bring out juices and flavours that you never knew existed within the ordinary ingredients in your kitchen...like red bean and whitefish porridge, or pork rib and wintermelon soup (where the meat falls off the bone).</p>

<p>The Pot is irreplaceable. The Slow Pot is also irreplaceable. Having both, you will be complete.</p>

                    <p>Thank you, Roger. Knowing that your pot "performed as expected at 7000 feet," I have, as promisd, ordered "the pot." </p>

<p>From what I've seen and read of your lovely wife Chaz, I'm sure she's right about most things, but in the matter of your cookbook title, I believe The Pot and How to Use It is a fine, understated title that humorously matches the type of shoot-from-the-hip cooking in your book. I hope you will stick to your authorial guns, in this case, while continuing to heed her advice in all all other areas. When do you expect this book to be available for purchase?</p>

<p><b> Ebert: Probably not before it is published. Although in these hard times, Amazon, in addition to its pre-order program, should add a half-price choice at for a book not yet written, to give starving authors some hope. Or a humanitarian program where you could send them the Pot. </b></p>

                    <p>My rice cooker was indispensable the years I lived in Japan. </p>

<p>In Japan I cooked rice in it, of course. In the morning I used it to make hot rice to eat with nato. In the evening for the meal's rice. I also made miso soup in it. I cooked cracked wheat in it when I wanted an American-style breakfast. I warmed up cabbage and onions in it, steamed hakusai cabbage or Chinese broccoli. I made a Chinese dish called mama-dofu -- kind of a spicy sauce with lots of tofu in it.</p>

<p>We got one for a wedding present here in the States. It was the best gift and lasted much longer than the cash we got at the reception.</p>

<p>My daughter is moving to Germany in December. She'll live in a small apartment with no counter space. Now I know what I'm getting her for Christmas. </p>

                    <p>   I think I will be getting the pot, and be doing my magic on it, as I call it.  I have a crock pot that has multiple settings and doesn't know jack that the orient knows, if you know what I mean...I have to do all the settings myself ::spits on floor like Craig Ferguson plugging another tv networks show::  But seasoning the oil you put in with seasoning adds another aroma.   </p>

                    <p>Urbana born, Potomac bred, I had never even HEARD of a rice cooker until I was 22 and in college, when I met my Taiwanese born wife. When I introduced her to my parents, they did their best to make her feel welcome by serving the only rice based dish they knew - Pork Chops, with Cream of Mushroom Gravy on Minute Rice.</p>

<p>She was appalled - APPALLED - by the Minute Rice, but didn't let it show.  To this day, a rice cooker has served as the mainstay of our lineup of Kitchen appliances.  I don't get to eat as many potatoes as I'd like (Irish/German), but well made Rice is like wonderstarch - you can do anything with it.  </p>

<p>But stay away from Minute Rice if you can - for the widest selection of quality rice (and rice cookers) in the Chicago area, my wife recommends Mitsuwa Grocery in Arlington Heights, on Algonquin and Arlington Heights Road - go for the groceries, stay for the many Chinese/Japanese food counters in the food court.</p>

                    <p>The potato poem is another gem which points to the beauties of the life less encumbered---I always love Van Gogh's painting of  his "Room",in fact I have a small print of it hanging in my own place--just a bed and a table and a towel hanging from the peg.I visited once Mahatma Gandhi's place of detention in the Agha Khan palace in Pune in Western India---his posessions amounted to his wooden footwear,spectacles,his favourite Bhagwatgita and another item or two..Even films are valuable insofar they enable us to explore and polish the grandeur of the inner universe which is the common heritage of a human being.The pot which you have so eloquently and poetically  described also has a certain austere technological and utilitarian beauty with its relative simplicity like the pots of olden times.Long live pots !</p>

                    <p>The best voice to hear your piece in is Samuel L. Jackson's.  This blog entry is the kind of stuff Tarantino busts his ass over.  Watch for it in the trailer of Pulp Fiction II--The Revenge of the Raped Timeline!</p>

<p>I stopped eating meat a year ago.  You know how I feel now?  Bored.  Dullest thing I ever decided to do.  Oh sure, my health is better, I've lost weight, I look younger, can exercise more--so I'm a real healthy boring bore.  I don't have the snap left to even put in an more interesting modifier for 'bore' than 'boring.'   </p>

<p>And the rice cooker is my pal, too.  </p>

<p>What's struck me over last year, after I had my taste buds and wit removed, is that there is no need to spend a lot on food.  If you're willing to eat dried legumes and rice, the world is--well if not your oyster, let's nod toward Val Kilmer and say it's your huckleberry, or daisy, or whatever other piece of flora he was spouting off about as he coughed up parts of his lung in Tombstone.  But I'm serious about the dried beans and other grains.  Cheap as can be, nutritious, and even a lunkhead like me can soak beans overnight.</p>

<p>You know--and this is none of my business, so feel free to tell me to screw off if it's too personal--but how have your dietary habits changed since the surgery?  You mentioned that you haven't tasted food for more than a year.  I'm with you on that as well.  Anosmia, they tell me mine's called.  Better than anhedonia, I guess.  I've laid off things that might spoil in a secret way, like milk, which looks OK.  I can't tell 'til it's coming back up that it's no good.  More than that, I eat as much chili pepper and curry as I can get my hands on, as that sweaty reaction is something close to taste.  </p>

<p>Thanks for not sending me off to Willams Sonoma for some fancy dancy thing.  I hate being in there as much as I hate waiting in Victoria's Secret, her secret being that no one cares how the present's wrapped, so long as there's easy access.</p>

                    <p>Roger,</p>

<p>I was not going to submit a comment for this topic because there is not much that I can say about rice cookers. The only time I eat rice is at Chinese restaurants. I guess I need to eat it more often, and one day I will try to purchase an inexpensive rice cooker.</p>

<p>I just wanted to say that this is a good idea for a topic. It is quite innocent, especially during election week which makes it nice. Internet bloggers do not always have to talk about serious subjects like politics. They also do not always have to discuss popular topics such as those related to entertainment. You do not always have to start topics on film.</p>

<p>I would like to see more topics about what you are interested in that have nothing to do with movies or anything serious. Tell us about your favorite books, what music you enjoy, other foods you like to eat, lessons on life that you have learned (I am sure at 66 there is much that you can say about life), or anything you do each week that makes your life simple, enjoyable, and meaningful.</p>

<p>Oh, and do you and Chaz own a bread maker? If so, tell us about it. If not, please get one. I have always loved the one my dad and step-grandfather have at their place in LA.</p>

<p>I think Chaz should start her own blog. Your readers might want to know something about her.       </p>

                    <p>Dear Roger,</p>

<p><br />
I dove into your blog tonight thinking I’d get some last minute campaign stumping–surely this will lead into “a chicken in every pot” line sometime soon.  Nope.  I got something far better.  Your ebullient tone in this piece is charming and utterly hysterical.  “<b>Musing my mind</b>” indeed.  This piece deserves a second Pulitzer for you.</p>

<p><br />
You can save time and skip to my antepenultimate and ultimate full paragraphs.  Between now and then  is just ramblings and a heartfelt coda.</p>

<p><br />
I must mention that once, by mistake, my girlfriend tossed the rice into the cooker without the metal lining in place.  I had to unscrew the bottom array and shake each grain out, but I marveled at the simplicity and functionality of the rice cooker’s inner workings.  On, warm, and off.  If only everything in life could be so clear.  (Incidentally, my girlfriend swears by the expensive Japanese rice found at upscale markets.  You <i>can</i> taste the difference.  She also told me her grandmother would quote a popular Japanese aphorism: “Don’t disturb the rice, even if the baby is crying.”  I suppose by that she means that one shouldn’t lift the lid, stir or do anything once the rice is simmering.  This explains why my fussed-over stove top rice used to always turn out like gruel.  It’s not surprising that I’ve never seen my gf cook rice with anything but her trusty rice cooker (she got it free with her Honda).  Another point worth mentioning, Japanese restaurants that make rice in the old stone pots make a rice so wonderful, your faith in your  trusty cooker may diminish.  It’s also common knowledge that rice should be washed.  Just put the rice in the cooker liner, fill it with water, swish it around with a clean hand, and pour out the water.  Repeat until the water runs clear.  It’s a technique like panning for gold.  Then do it with filtered water a time or two if you don’t trust your local DWP (and who should?).</p>

<p><br />
Yes, I, your constant reader, recalled your Aunt Mary’s extra helping “for fear of company” recipe, although I’ll be damned if I can remember the context in which you first mention it.  I believe it was within the last two years that I read it, but hyperlinks to such arcana would be appreciated by your acolytes.</p>

<p><br />
I spent no small amount of my free time writing without posting about your “Musing” and “Little Rule Book” blogs.  Both of those blogs are absolutely genius.  And by that, I don’t mean great or brilliant, I mean abso-friggin’-lutely genius.  What lit the proverbial fire under my derriere to actually write in about your latest posting was this line:  <b>Any fruit except something like watermelon. I shouldn't have to be telling you this.</b> I almost put on the brakes with a “<i>klang</i>” of disbelief sound effect but fortunately I was already online and could learn that a watermelon is, indeed, Virginia, a fruit (some on the web make the argument for “fruigetable,” perhaps further enhancing your status as the second best best blog on the web).  Okay, no weirder to this city boy than the fact that a tomato is also a fruit.  I don’t want to know on which side the cumquat falls, but it is my favorite sounding fruit <i>or</i> vegetable in the English language.  One side bar: I don’t want to ask you a question and make you think you shouldn’t answer this because if you answer every question you are asked, you’ll have no time left, but you, Oh Wise One, being the journalist that you are, can probably help me out: Does the above comma used for “fruigetable” belong inside or outside the quotation marks?  I think it should go on the outside, it clearly being jargon or a word used for ironic intent, but I’ve never used a wordprocessor (or teacher) that didn’t insist that all punctuation belongs inside the quote marks.  Even the web is conflicting on this.  What’s your take.  </p>

<p><br />
And while I’m asking questions (and I know it’s always been your policy to never explain why you didn’t review such and such a movie ((except recently for “Fireproof” and “An American Carol.”)), and I know it probably came out during your convalescence, when are you going to review David Gordon Green’s “Snow Angeles?”  (I want to put that question mark outside the quotes for some reason–maybe the question mark is throwing me off–damn, I nearly ended my sentence with a preposition–what’s the official rule on <i>that</i>?)  I just watched it on DVD last night and was completely enthralled by it.  Honestly, I thought the director, lead actors Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale, and the adapted screenplay should all be up for Oscars.  You know... if the Oscars didn’t completely suck so often.  I was surprised to learn that the movie’s copyright  was 2006, because I remember recently wanting to see it but not finding the time to do so.  Huge mistake on my part.  Anyway, please review it, damn it.  Reaffirm for me that it <i>is</i> awesome.  And not awesome in the way that you thought the new Indiana Jones movie was awesome.  I mean “awesome” awesome.</p>

<p><br />
I’m sorry to blather so long.  It’s your fault for having such a damn good blog.</p>

<p><br />
Much love.</p>

<p><br />
Now give us a pro Obama blog before Tuesday!  You know, please.</p>

                    <p>Here's an oatmeal variation: use steel-cut oatmeal -- like the Oirish stuff in the cans, but about 1/7th the price in bulk.  Take a 10oz wide-mouth thermos bottle, add 1/3 cup of oatmeal, raisins, butter, a pinch of salt, whatever twirls your squirrel.  Sometimes miso does it for me.  Top up to where the bottom of the cap is (figure it out, Feynman) with boiling water.  Cover and let sit for maybe an hour and a half -- this works great if all you can eat when you wake up is coffee and dark chocolate.  </p>

<p>Apparently using larger vacuum-thermos pots for cooking like this is big where rice cookers come from.</p>

                    <p>Dear Roger, under my Salty Rice recipe, Tip #4, I wrote: <i>If you don't have chicken meat, use 1 chicken cube (bouillon cube)</i>. This is ill-advised. I should not have included that line because, as you know, we should always go for the real thing. Besides, it escaped me yesterday that using bouillon cubes would further salinate the rice. Only upon recollection today did it dawn upon me. Apologies.</p>

<p>Instead of chicken meat, pork chunks also do well in this recipe. Additional onion, garlic and ginger aren't out of the question; though, one may substitute shallots with the white one for more pungency. Chopped spring onions may also be fancied. To decrease salinity, go easy on the soy sauce.</p>

                    <p>What a loving paean to the rice cooker! I've yet to get one myself. Though I always botch rice. Have to add water or turn up the heat and try to finish it faster. So I suppose I ought to get one.</p>

<p>I like your sauces. Myself I can't live without Sriracha hot chili paste in the house, or Peter Luger's steak sauce. I even put them in tuna salad. Now that I'm commingling with a Louisiana gal, Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning has become my salt. If you're gonna have salt, you might as well have some flavor along with it.</p>

                    <p>Roger,</p>

<p>This is a wonderful blog. It is practical. It is useful. It has been road-tested. And I cook a great deal like Aunt Mary. Sure, I have recipes--have <b>actually been known to use one</b>, but I can make food happen without them.</p>

<p>Two observations:<br />
(1) It seems written in the (outstandingly smart-assy) spirit of Rick Blaine. "You're right, Ugarte. I <b>am</b> a little 'impressed' with you." and of course, "Are my eyes really brown?"<br />
(2) It's so beautifully anti-elitist. It's a Pot. It's simple. buy it. It works. <i>The Pot knows.</i></p>

<p>All right, another observation. So perhaps you are the #2 best-written blog. (OK, <b>your blog</b>, not you)--you're the still the best-read. Einstein...</p>

                    <p>Hi Roger,<br />
I read with great pleasure and amusement your blog about THE POT.  It was, for me, a moment of peace and laughter because my husband and I are locked in a state of limbo and anxiety. We are doing the worry dance to a tune set by others.  However, The Pot was a way for me to transport myself back in time to the early days of our marriage.  As an inexperienced bride, that darn pot came in handy.  Not knowing much about spices and cooking, I would throw caution aside and just dump everything into the pot.  My husband had other things on his mind and would eat everything, smiling and talking without a clue as to mess he had just consumed.  Oh, but later after an hour in the bathroom and the pink stuff wiped from his lips he would say,"Are you trying to kill me."  No late night in the bedroom that evening!<br />
The Pot can also be thought of as symbol for throwing everything in and hoping beyond hope that we discover the magic of a Julia Child, to stimulate our culinary senses, or in this case our desire for a CHANGE OF MENU. I for one have lost my appetite for the chaos that surrounds the rooms of one's life.<br />
Neither the kitchen nor the White House needs to be a mess anymore.  Let us surround ourselves with fresh and gorgeous ingredients which make for a good life.  And lastly, STUDS we will miss your unique and genuine voice.  Rest easy.  <br />
If we forget the great voices of the past we are locked into a space the size of our pot with only two switches and very little options for a full and satisfying life.</p>

<p>HAPPY COOKING ROGER</p>

<p>Judy Shuster</p>

<p><b> Ebert: This is none of my beeswax, but, Jeez, sounds like the Pot might have contributed to anxiety in your marriage. </b></p>

                    <p>This took me back to my undergrad years when I was in Japan.</p>

<p>A typical girls dorm room had a rice cooker, a hotpot (strictly for boiling water although soup and hotdogs also worked) and a toaster oven.</p>

<p>A really nice room would have had a rice cooker, hotpot, toaster oven, an electric skillet and maybe, a microwave. </p>

<p>These were all against school fire safety policies. It really is amazing what kind of meals we could make, including miso shiru from scratch. </p>

<p>I later lived in apartments or was invited to apartments where all they had was a rice cooker and an electric skillet and sometimes a hibachi. We steamed potstickers and buns (nikuman or baozi).</p>

<p>Traditional Japanese homes do not have ovens so baking was sort of a challenge. I did manage to make banana bread by steaming.</p>

<p>My last time in Japan, I don't quite remember how, but I did make a turkey stew, cranberry sauce, tapioca pudding, wild rice stuffing in Japan. I don't think I used the hibachi. That was a Japanese Thanksgiving, of course. </p>

<p>Last time I used a rice cooker, it was to make rice for sushi. I always add 1/4 to 1/3 of brown rice and then toasted sesame seeds for added nutrition and taste and prefer honey instead of sugar. </p>

<p>Growing up, I learned how to cook rice in a regular pot--without butter. Rice should stick together if it's Japanese-style. </p>

<p>Now, I prefer bread, from scratch. I have my own breadmaker. I understand I can use it to make jam. Mostly, I like to make marmalade from scratch. I understand I can use my breadmaker for that. I tried my crockpot, but that didn't work. Maybe, I can use my rice cooker for that.</p>

<p><b> Ebert: Love those toasted sesame seeds! We have a bread maker, which can be timed to awaken us with the aroma of fresh-baked cinnamon bread. A confession: The Pot may be all you need, but it needn't be all you want. As every Realtor® will tell you, nothing smells more like home than cinnamon. </b></p>

                    <p>Roger - I have always suspected you were a pothead . . . </p>

<p>Thank you SO much for the most excellent entry regaling us with advice and humor, Oh Pot Guru (Sensei?).</p>

<p>This helps, as I've had angst for years regarding which Pot to get (though I've always known it would a Zojirushi, so it could bond with my Zojirushi bread maker) and how to use it.  I appreciate your sharing cooking suggestions even more learning that you, yourself, can't eat solids these days (however, I AM glad to hear that your health is good and you're feeling so well).</p>

<p>In other news - as to Tony Sosa's post and your response . . . as my wise mother says, "It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye."</p>

                    <p>Roger:</p>

<p>I usually use a Dutch Oven for this one, but it would probably work with a Pot as well. You might need to cut the recipe in half or adjust the cooking times, depending on the size of your Pot.</p>

<p>PUMPKIN SOUP</p>

<p>1. Chop up 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks, and a small (baseball-sized) onion.<br />
2. Saute these with about 2 tbsp butter in the bottom of the pot for a few minutes.<br />
3. Add one 29 oz can pumpkin, three 14 oz cans chicken or vegetable broth, and five whole cloves.<br />
4. Simmer until the vegetables are tender. (I don't know how you "simmer" with the Pot, but I usually give it about 30 minutes on medium-low with the Dutch Oven.)<br />
5. Remove the five cloves.<br />
6. Puree the soup in batches in a blender, about 1 1/2 cups at a time.<br />
7. Add some skim milk, cream, or half-&-half (your choice), a couple of tbsps of honey, and salt & pepper to taste.<br />
8. Drizzle a little milk or cream on top of the soup before serving.</p>

                    <p>Any idiot can make good rice using a simple rice cooker, but it takes a special kind of idiot, such as me, to screw it up.  In an attempt to make the meal even healthier, I used filtered water with the rice.  Unfortunately the water came from my Brita pitcher straight from the refrigerator, and apparently near frozen water has a way of tricking the cooker into thinking it is prematurely done.  I still use filtered water with my rice, but now I let it warm to room temperature before cooking.</p>

Your comments about your Aunt Mary reminded me of one of my favorite vignettes from Ray Bradbury's "Dandelion Wine". Douglas Spaulding's Grandmother's kitchen is organized, tidied up, and filled with all possible measuring devices - and the meals that come out of that kitchen are terrible! <br />

                    <p>Roger, thank you so much for this post and for sharing such an unexpected side of yourself.  I am a gourmet who loves to cook with Julia Child and will happily dirty 17 pots and pans in the pursuit of a velvety sauce.  That said, I have written a cookbook that I give to my nieces and nephews as they leave home on how to cook the inexpensive basics (rice, baked potatoes, oatmeal, frozen vegetables, eggs) in the hopes that they'll learn that some meals need not come in a styrofoam box.  With your permission, I'll print and include your essay in the revision for this year's high school senior - just as soon as I purchase my own Pot and mess around with it, too.</p>

<p>I pursue food the way I think you pursue film - as long as there are some real ingredients, we will learn something by the way someone else is telling the story.  Thanks for your thoughtful film criticism and your honest approach to real food.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for this post.  My boyfriend brings up the idea of getting a rice cooker periodically, but I always shoot it down because I have never had any trouble making rice.  (My method for white rice such as basmati or jasmine: place 2:1 water:rice in a covered saucepan over high heat.  As soon as the water is boiling -- you should be able to see the lid rattling, but I have been known to lift and take a quick peek -- immediately drop your burner to the lowest setting it can handle. Wait about 10 minutes for one cup of rice, 15 for 2-3 cups.  Take a very quick peek, and if you see a few "holes" in the mass of rice -- due to escaping steam -- remove rice from heat.  The step of knowing when rice is finished is tricky, but once the upper grains are clearly dry you can risk letting steam escape while you take a fork and probe the bottom of the pan. If you want to err on the side of caution, remove the rice from heat while there is still a bit of water in the pan and leave the lid on so steaming will continue while you prepare your other food.)  </p>

<p>The problem with stovetop rice is that you have to keep your mind on it.  When you have kids and writing deadlines and other distractions, a rice cooker does sound nice. I thought I was saving money by keeping myself tethered to the stove (since I couldn't argue that rice from a Pot would be better than my own rice), but now you have shown me the light: I can cook many things in a steamer, and free myself up to write until I'm damn well ready to deal with the food again.  The possibilities seem endless.  </p>

<p>I'm still quite confused about some of the recipes (if I am putting raw meat in with rice and veggies, does the meat go in after the rice is done or somewher in the middle? Do the veggies go on top of raw meat or go in later?  Also, when I cook on the stovetop I like to saute in order to get oil and seasonings into my mushrooms, and I can't tell if the Pot will achieve a similar result via steaming), but I figure I'll go check out some of those cookbooks you mention to see if they'll give me some more detailed guidance.</p>

                    <p>Maybe it's because Halloween was last Friday--more personally, because we had our annual at-home film festival, the Halloween Roundup (seven movies later, and everything's scary)--but there seems to be an indie horror film hiding in here, about a college dorm where students--and packages of Ramen noodles--are mysteriously disappearing, while a delicious aroma emanates from the room of that creepy guy down the hall who showed up last fall lugging a bunch of rice cookers.

                    <p>Mr. Ebert,</p>

<p>I would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions for avoiding the horrible scourge of Scorched Pot Bottom.  I have the Panasonic 10 cup pictured above, and I have never not lost a small handful of rice at the bottom of my pot.  I've tried oil, non-stick cooking spray, more water, less water, prayer, and pleading.  Any wise words from the pot guru?</p>

<p><b> Ebert: My Pots have never scorched, not once. Are you using enough liquid? The Pot should turn off before that happens. </b></p>

The comma goes inside the quotes.</i></b></p>

<p>I know the comma is supposed to go inside the quotes, but it just doesn't look (or feel) right to me. The same goes for periods placed inside quotes. I always put both on the outside. I know this is wrong, but I do it anyway. I'm just a grammar maverick, I guess.</p>

<p>I have yet to try the Pot for anything, but it has inspired me to try the crock pot we have here. I'm wondering what the difference between the two is exactly..? Google, here I come.</p>

                    <p>For shame, Roger - you turn down millions of dollars from Mayor McCheese and his roving gang of happy, child-pleasing artery cloggers, but you happily take money from the Amazon.com rice cooking lobby?</p>

<p>I have a friend who has a rice cooker. Until this post, I thought that they were stupid, useless things. This friend got the micro-zirconium fuzzy logic happy song playing things. I ate at his house once and waited (and waited and waited) for the food because he insisted upon hearing of the happy song.</p>

<p>Now that I find that these things are one touch and wonderful, I find that my college has banned them! Dumb question, but is it worth it to sneak one in? Food here on the weekends is notoriously awful, and the cooker would come in a plain old box.</p>

<p>It would be easy...</p>

                    <p>After so many thoughtful and delicious posts, I hesitate to add my two cents worth, but here goes;  recently I found out that you can put leftover rice in one of those ziploc bags, then freeze it.</p>

<p>OK, that is not the exciting part.  Hear me out. </p>

<p>Later on, as it might be for lunch the next day, you can fish out that bag, put a little water in it if it looks dry at all, and then microwave it for about a minute until it's hot.  And it's really good.  It isn't all sort of weird and dry the way rice gets if you leave it in the fridge.  I should say that I've only tried this with basmati, my table rice of choice if I'm not eating East Asian food.</p>

<p>Give it a try.  And I will buy a Zojirushi rice cooker -- I love my Zojirushi bread machine.  </p>

<p>"A vessel is a kind of utensil. Because the great earth is hollowed out, water collects on it; and because the blue sky is pure, the moon shines in it. When the moon rises, the water glows with a pure light; and when the rain falls, the plants and trees flourish.</p>

<p>A vessel is hollowed out like the earth, and water can be collected in it the way water is stored in a pond. And the reflection of the moon floats on the surface of the water ......</p>

<p>But a vessel is susceptible to four faults. The first is being upset or covered, which means that the vessel can be overturned or covered with a lid. The second is leaking, which means that the water leaks out. The third is being defiled, which means that the contents can be contaminated. Though the water itself may be pure, if filth is dumped into it, then the water in the vessel ceases to be of any use. The fourth is being mixed. If rice is mixed with filth or pebbles or sand or dirt, then it is no longer fit for human consumption.</p>

<p>The vessel here stands for our bodies and minds. Our minds are a kind of vessel, and our mouths too are vessels, <br />
as are our ears. ....."</p>

<p>To quote:</p>

<p>"Toasters, toaster ovens, microwave ovens, George Foreman grills (or similar versions), popcorn poppers are not permitted. A kitchenette, equipped with a microwave, is available on each floor."</p>

<p>It says nothing of rice cookers, but surely if they're against knocking out the fat, they're against the Pot.</p>

                    <p>This was fascinating, but also all true. As a person raised in the West but now living in India, I have two pots - one by Morphy Richards and one by Black and Decker - and they both cost around the same. In fact, they look spectacular - the Morphy Richards especially has this amazing steel sheen to it - almost futuristic.</p>

<p>I must state here that I do not use any other cooking utensils other than the pots. Why? Its easy, convenient, and you can actually whip up fancy meals with these, once you spend time getting to know it. For example, I make the BEST bacon and cheese fritatta using the pot, even better than in any other equipment I've used. They do omelettes spectacularly, and they boil water at lightning fast speed. Seriously, I never saw water boil that quick.</p>

<p>What is especially nice is when I leave for a long day at work - I just put in a couple pounds of chicken on the bone in, cover it with water, add some seasoning, and let it cook. Since it switches to 'keep warm' automatically, I am treated to a spectacularly delicious meal when I get home around 10 hours later. In this aspect it does rival crock-pot cooking.</p>

<p>Rice cooks perfectly, potatoes cook perfectly, and since all pots usually have non-stick bottoms, you can cook virtually anything, or fry anything, without worrying about cleaning up or making a mess.</p>

<p>Ebert, I do think though that this piece of equipment is not just meant for 'solitary writers' or single people on a budget. On the contrary, my own demographic is removed from this, and I have specifically chosen the pot to replace my traditional pans and woks and frying pans, only because it does the work of ALL of those equipments, plus more.</p>

<p>Thanks Roger, for making this divine piece of technology better known in the West. I was afraid it would remain an Eastern secret for far too long! If you can, seek out a Chinese brand called Koryo - they make the BEST pots, not much to look at, but they LAST, and their cooking times are always on point.</p>

Until came a pan,<br />
By the name of Dan.<br />
But alas! He was a pan with no handle!</p>

Achieved a measure of fame<br />
By tipping its cooker<br />

Richard Kaufman - </p>

<p>According to the BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/branding/pdf/writing_style_guidelines_jan06.pdf">Writing Style Guidelines</a>, "(P)unctuation at the end of a sentence comes inside the quotation marks if the quote is a full sentence."  Otherwise, the BBC tends to place punctuation, including full stops, outside of the quotation marks.  If the punctuation is part of the quote, it remains inside the quotation marks.  The full stop, by the way, cannot end a quoted sentence when it does not also end the actual sentence, in which case, the replacement comma is inside the quotation marks as per the above rule.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/us_elections_2008/7707581.stm">Case in point.</a></p>

<p>Personally, I use <i>typesetters' quotation</i> because the alternative, <i>logical quotation</i>, just doesn't feel right.<br />

<p>I was impressed to hear from a former student that you are proponent of the Pritikin eating plan and a healthy lifestyle. Two books which might interest you and your journal readers are The China Study by Colin Campbell, Ph.D. and Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease by Caldwell Essesltyn, M.D. They are both excellent reads and proponents of whole-food, plant based diets for disease prevention and treatment. I wish you all the best.</p>

2 cups of rice, preferably Mahatma long grain, go figure. <br />
Add one tentacle of orange spider thingy, the zest from a slinky fisted robot thingy, flavor with dollops of skull-faced minion to taste. Four cups water (collected from a spewing fire hydrant if possible. (There really is a difference.) Cover pot. Bring to boil using rocket fists. Then reduce heat to warm. Go conquer Earth. Enjoy.<br />

                    <p>I'm fairly skeptical on this magical pot that you speak of. I lived for more than two years with nothing but the smallest of all the George Foreman grills and a hot plate. There wasn't a single thing I couldn't do with those things. If I have a chance though I may pick up one of these rice cookers and see if there's anything I can do with it on my very limited budget. Thanks for the advice!</p>

                    <p>Thanks, Roger - very serendipitous. Our trusty rice cooker's timer crapped out a couple of months ago after about 14 years. I was occasionally remembering to have a look at rice cookers when in various stores, but all of them had way too many features, were too big, or something else equally grotesque.</p>

<p>So my order went in yesterday, and the big brown truck will deliver the new pot tomorrow morning. With just two settings it will fit right in with my cooking credo - when the smoke alarm goes off, it's done.</p>

                    <p>Totally random question for you, Roger: I'm making my way through your (utterly superb) book on Scorsese, and I don't see anything on his 1970 documentary "Street Scenes." It remains the only film by him that I haven't seen (except some of his early short films - "The Big Shave," etc.). It's damn near impossible to procure. Have you seen it? What's the reason for it's omission? Thanks.</p>

<p><b> Ebert: No reason. Didn't do the Big Shave, either. </b></p>

                    <p>Thanks for the non-rice ideas! As for how the magic pot works, it's just like that old science demo where you put some water in an unwaxed paper cup and hold it over a candle. The water boils but the cup doesn't burn until it boils dry. In a rice cooker, once the moisture is gone, a bimetallic strip (invented by the great English clock maker John Harrison) bends with increased temperature and flips the cooker over to "warm" mode. Simple and elegant.<br />

                    <p>Roger, I bought The Pot. You were right. It does work here at 4700 feet. I was astonished at the much higher proportion of water to rice that it called for in contrast to what's recommended on the whole grain rice packaging. It cooked for about an hour and ten minutes, shut itself off, and I let it sit for another ten minutes. Perfect, fluffy rice. For the first time since I moved to this altitude, perfect, fluffy rice. Thanks, Roger!</p>

                    <p>Roger, I write reluctantly. My wife says I should. I'm not sure what I can say that the 177 previous posters have not, but I tend to do what she says. We all know why. Why does she think I should post? Because I am a blind follower of all your reviews, for starters. She says, "Let's go see this movie" and it strikes her as cute that my response is invariably "What did Roger think of it?" (You going to review "The Secret" soon? I had to go see it without knowing your opinion.)</p>

<p>I have taken to reading less of your reviews (not fewer) because I find I like being more surprised by the story. But I always check your rating. She says you are "one of my father figures" and I can't disagree but I've considered you mainly the great movie reviewer of our time. Anthony Lane could take a few notes</p>

<p>But it is this rice cooker piece that tips the scale and moves me from passive fan to active respondent. I love the tone of your journal; the darkness, the feigned snarkiness. I've got the 5 cup Sanyo myself, a gift from Mom. Being Japanese-American (Happa) I've respectfully limited my use to Japanese white rice up until now. OK sometimes I go crazy and add sauteed onions, or fresh spinach. But now, the sky's the limit and I thank you for that. In an Obama presidency, why not make lamb stew? Yes we can. </p>

<p>My daughter is a college freshman and turns 18 this week. I just bought her the Sanyo 3-cup pot. The Zojirushi 3-cup lacked the "warm" setting and the cord wasn't detachable. She hates soup, but she's getting a 10 lb bag of rice and the link to your entry here. I trust she'll figure it out. </p>

<p>Thank you for the decades of writing, the movie advice, and now the journal. I am so happy you are recovering your health and know I'm a big fan over here in the SF Bay Area.  </p>

<p>I just downloaded some John Prine too. <br />

                    <p>Roger, I don't have a proper kitchen, so I use my pot to cook pasta, rice and lentils. The only bad thing about the pot is that it is limited to boiling. This means that you can't create the fried base of onions and garlic that classic soups usually have. Apart from that, the pot is perfect. I couldn't live without it.</p>

<p><b> Ebert: I have done this. Spray the Teflon pot with low fat Pam (olive oil type). Add a little olive oil and chopped onion and garlic. Close and heat. Don't allow onions to burn. You can open briefly to stir onions a little, and check on progress. Monitor  closely, and have other soup ingredients all ready to add. </b></p>

                    <p>I got up today, made coffee and rice cooker oatmeal, and then read this.  Coincidence!  It made the oatmeal all the more delicious.  Another way to make the oatmeal delicious is to put raisins in right at the beginning with the oatmeal.  They get all plumped up and sweeten it and then you don't need sugar.</p>

                    <p>Another wonderful kitchen gadget that helped me survive the college years was a 1970s fondue pot. Yes, a fondue pot. To this day, it makes the best omelets - the angled sides reflect heat back down on top of the cheese and veggies... spaghetti, sautéed items, oatmeal... it was my stovetop.</p>

<p>Is this a case of desperation/poverty breeding creativity? Certainly in my case! But now I have a new thing to explore... </p>

<p>We have a 12 year old 3-cup Zojirushi from a local asian grocery. I love the elephant logo (selling point for me).  Have always used Basmati or Japanese sushi rice. I thought it was a bit of an extravagant item to buy but we eat a lot more rice now than we used to and it's one thing I don't have to worry about or time or coordinate with the rest of the meal. My husband won't let me add anything - even seasonings to our rice - while it's in the cooker... I will have to show him this post and change his mind! Does it affect the flavor of plain rice when you cook in it in such a way? Or is he paranoid like those coffee fanatics who won't grind flavored coffee in their coffee grinders?</p>

                    <p>OK, I know I'm a little late to the party but... I love our rice cooker too!  We once went camping for two full months and cooked most of our breakfasts and dinners out of our rice cooker.</p>

<p>However, due to the amount of cooking we do on it, we invested in a fuzzy logic Zojirushi.  Not only can it cook brown rice very well (which our old one can't do), it has a much-loved, much-used feature: the timer.  For blood-sugar reasons I have to eat within about 20 minutes of waking up.  My Zojirushi is timed so that every day I have slow-cooked oatmeal waiting for me upon waking.  And it's great to set up rice cooking in the morning, with it timed to be done at dinner.  My rice cooker has two timers, actually, so I have one automatically set for breakfast and one for dinnertime.</p>

<p>They are expensive, but I actually worked out the price for buying the rice cooker and cooking with cheap organic oatmeal versus the cereal we'd been eating every day-- and the cooker paid for itself quickly.</p>

<p>It might be worth mentioning the timing feature in your Pot book. Some folks may not think a Pot is worth it if they have to set it after coming home from work in the evenings.  The only drawback about the timer is the annoyingly cheery "Twinkle theme" that plays when it's finished.  My husband opened it up and removed the speaker.  </p>

                    <p>At the risk of revealing the man behind the curtain, the rice cooker is actually very simple technologically. There is a thermostat that touches the bottom of the pot which switches off (or to 'warm') when all the water has boiled off. This prevents the rice from burning. This is a great convenience because, as others have noted here, you can make rice on the stove but you have to mind it.</p>

<p>Since the boiling stops when the water is gone, the main thing that controls the softness of the grains is the ratio of water to rice (or other ingredients like oatmeal.) There is also the slight complication that the rice in the pot needs to be deep, that is, a 10-cup cooker works best with 7-10 cups but would not work well with only 3 cups.</p>

<p>While it is in cooking mode, the rice maker is the same as any electric pot. So, you can make pasta in a rice cooker (though you cannot cook rice with a pasta maker!)</p>

                    <p>posting a recipe:</p>

<p>If the world were ending tomorrow I'd still make a rice cooker meal for dinner. The most recent consisted of sauteed onions, andouille sausage, cooked leftover chicken and bok choi, a sort of 94121 jambalaya. serves 4 or so</p>

<p>1. chop 1/2 onion and saute it in olive oil, in the pot.<br />
2. add 3c rice and mix in til coated and moist<br />
3. throw in some white wine if your wife isn't looking. 1/2 c<br />
4. add water to the 3c line, salted. chicken bouillon wouldn't hurt<br />
5. brown one sausage, chopped into round slices, separately<br />
6. after 10m add bok choi and the sausage and the cooked chicken</p>

<p>additional things you can add:<br />
Worcestershire sauce<br />
piment d'esplette or red pepper flakes<br />
anything new orleans-y: shrimp, bell pepper</p>

<p>the cooker should flip off after 15m or so. toss ingreadients and let sit another 10 - 15m. serve. </p>

                    <p>Based on some advice given on your blog, I have finally figured out have to get my rice cooker to work without having to wipe water off the crown molding.<br />
 <br />
I’ve been working with some things such as taking my chili recipe out of the Dutch oven and trying it in the rice cooker and it is delicious.  I don't know if you can eat chili but here’s my recipe anyway:<br />
 <br />
Ingredients:<br />
* 2 teaspoon of Tabasco sauce<br />
* 1/2 cup water<br />
* 1 clove of minced garlic<br />
* 1 teaspoon of pepper<br />
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning<br />
* 1 tablespoon olive oil<br />
* 1 medium-sized onion, chopped<br />
* 1-1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin powder<br />
* 2 lbs. ground round, brown and drain<br />
* 2 teaspoons salt<br />
* 2 cans of kidney beans, drain<br />
* 2 cans (14.5 ounces each) whole tomatoes - drain and chop<br />
* 4 tablespoons chili powder (I use six but only when I am the only one eating it.</p>

<p>Prep:<br />
* Brown and drain the ground round in the skillet.<br />
* Combine all ingredients in slow cooker and mix thoroughly.<br />
* Put on low and cook for eight to ten hours.<br />
* Stir occasionally (this is optional, varying results have occurred).<br />
 <br />
Enjoy!<br />

                    <p>I didn't think to post this here, so I just cut and pasted from my last entry.</p>

<p>Tomatillo sauce, aka Salsa Verde</p>

<p>I've never been very precise with this.</p>

<p>Makes a lot - good for two or three pans of rolled enchiladas, with some left over for dipping.</p>

<p><br />
Ingredients:</p>

<p>2-4 lbs tomatillos, with outer paper removed, and rinsed. Can be kept whole.</p>

<p>one large white or yellow onion, quartered.</p>

<p>1-3 serrano peppers, depending upon how spicy you like it. Some like it hot. I prefer classical music. I usually use two.</p>

<p>handful of fresh cilantro, finely chopped.</p>

<p>6 Oz. plain yogurt or sour cream.</p>

<p>water.</p>

<p>salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>Hardware:</p>

<p>A rice cooker.</p>

<p>A blender or food processor.</p>

<p>A colander or slotted spoon. The type for pasta, with the teeth, works best for this purpose.</p>

<p>Usually, I just toss the tomatillos, onion, and serranos in a pot with the water and bring them to a boil. When the tomatillos turn a shade of pea-soup green, they're done. It'll just take a bit of extra vigilance to get it right.<br />
When the tomatillos are cooked, strain the contents of the pot, or scoop them out with a slotted spoon, and put the contents in the blender or food processor, with the cilantro and yogurt. If you don't want as much spice, remove one or all of the serrano peppers. Blend until smooth.</p>

<p>I usually make this sauce for enchiladas, like my mother always did when I was a kid. It's a nice change from all of the red chile sauces that most everyone else uses for theirs. Next time I make a batch, I'll tape it and post it on youtube for all the world to see. Until then, I hope that this works.</p>

<p>Of course, this now gets me thinking about food movies.  My favorite is "Big Night," with Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoub.  The entire movie is delicious; I watched it in film school, and my desk was practically soaked from my drool. I immediately went to the grocery store and spent a couple of hours making an Italian dinner for my roommates after that.  Plus, the final scene is one of the finest I've ever seen.  If a book or a movie has a title related to food, I'll pick it up, no matter the subject.  Most interesting discovery:  on a friend's recommendation, "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover."  "Try the cock; it's a delicacy."  Helen Mirren is amazing.  Do you have a food movie that gets your juices flowing? </p>

"Pot Begins"</p>

<p>All of these titles remind me of an episode of "The Simpson's," wherein the family is preparing to host a party.  They decide to do their shopping in the local mall, at a cookware shop called "Stoner's Pot Palace."  As they walk into the store, Otto, the perpetually confused school bus driver, walks out shaking his head, muttering, "Man, that is FLAGRANT false advertising!"</p>

<p>Excerpt:<br />
"It was the best of pots, it was the worst of pots, it was the pot of wisdom, it was the pot of foolishness, it was the pot of belief, it was the pot of incredulity, it was the pot of Light, it was the pot of Darkness, it was the cooker of hope, it was the cooker of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to rice heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the cooking period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of kitchen comparison only.  </p>

<p>Yes, Like Dickens before me, I had discovered the age-old misery of choosing the perfect rice cooker."</p>

<p>Or not...</p>

<p>A little something for those interested in preparing "Le Feast Holiday!" http://www.hulu.com/watch/3523/saturday-night-live-the-french-chef<br />

<p>1-1/3 Non-quick oats<br />
3/4 Cup of water<br />
2 cups of Apple Juice<br />
1/2 cup of raisins (or the fruit of your choice)</p>

<p>Add all ingredients.  Cover and cook about 15-20 minutes (unless cooker shuts off first).  Stir only once during the cooking process to prevent sticking.  Cover and let stand for 5 minutes.  Serves 4.</p>

<p>I have been told that you have to spray the cooker first, but I haven’t used it and it has turned out fine.<br />

                    <p>Dear Mr. Ebert,<br />
Our rice cooker is the most used appliance in our kitchen.  Here is my favorite recipe.  It's easy, tasty and very good for you.  </p>

<p>Make a pot of rice.  I prefer Basmati.  Place a layer of raw spinach and arugula at the bottom of your rice bowl.  Pile on the rice.  The heat from the rice will wilt the greens to perfection.  Top with a sprinkle of toasted sesame oil and soy sauce.  You can also add Albacore tuna and walnuts.  Then get cozy on the couch and dig in.  This is my favorite comfort food.  I call it "Cozy Rice Salad".  There is no better kitchen invention then the Rice Cooker.  The next best appliance is the Bread Machine.  Got one at a thrift store for $5!  It's saved us a small fortune.  But that's another book for another time.<br />
Thanks Mr. Ebert! </p>

                    <p>I want you to know how much I'm enjoying the rice cooker you recommended. It isn't fussy and it makes perfect rice every time here at 4700 feet above sea level. I've recently discovered Basmati (sp?) rice, and really like it long then texture. My husband and I have rediscovered the joys of eating rice, after thirty some years at this altitude, and we have you to thank! How's the cookbook coming? I don't have any recipe's to contribute, but I  can tell you that following the instructions that came with the cooker gives me perfectly cooked dried beans and whole grain rice. My husband tells me just about every weekend how glad he is that we bought the cooker. Just thought you'd like to know.</p>

<p><b>Readers, this is your three-day warning to <i>get those recipes</i> in for the cookbook inspired by my entry "The Pot and How to Use It."</b></p>

<p><b>Here is your chance at gourmet immortality.  Include your name and where you are. Just a first name or handle if you insist.</b></p>

<p><b>They can be amateur, seat-of-the-pants recipes. We will polish them up. You can just list the stuff that goes in and let me figure out how gto concert for the Pot.</b></p>

<p><b>I especially would like to hear from the many readers in India, South Korea, China, Japan, Chile, Argentina, Turkey, Germany, the UK, Ireland and Sweden. Also from Marie Haws.</b></p>

                    <p>I have one question: will it cook grits?</p>

<p>Not those terrible imposters, the so-called "Instant Grits" or even the dreaded "Quick Grits," but honest-to-God, stone-ground, tender, yummy, real grits?</p>

<p>Because that would be awesome. </p>

<p><b>Ebert: No problem. Adapted to rom  http://startcooking.com/blog/360/How-to-Make-Grits:</b></p>

<p><b>1/2 cup of real stone-ground grits.</b></p>

<p><b>2.5 cups water, maybe a splash more.</b></p>

<p><b>One T butter and dash of salt.</b></p>

<p><b>When grits have boiled 60 seconds, switch to "hold" and leave along for 45 minute. </b></p>

<p><b>If grits are too firm, they needed a little more water or a little more boiling or both. Experiment.</b></p>

<p><b>Now, for this advice you owe me a recipe for grits <i>and</i> something.</b> Black-eyed peas, shrimp, anything.</p>

                    <p>OH!  You meant a "crock" pot or slow cooker! (Laughing!)  I thought you were looking for recipes <i>using</i> pot - and for medicinal purposes! </p>

<p>Gee, I'm not sure if I have a crock pot recipe - unless you count mushroom risotto?</p>

<p>And no, not <i>magic</i> mushrooms!  Chuckle!  That would actually be totally gross, as they're disgusting and taste like dirt (so I've heard.)</p>

<p>I need to get the recipe though, as my friend Cheryl actually made it.  But once I've got it, I'll share it in here, as it was super creamy and yummy!</p>

                    <p>Hello Roger, I just noticed that I have to give my buddy Marie my mushroom risotto recipe so she can post it here. In the meanwhile, I'm going to tell you and your hundreds of friends here how to grill the best damn CHEAP steak you ever had.<br />
First of all, buy flank steak, it is inexpensive but flavourful.<br />
Slice a nice big fat Red Onion into 1/2 inch slices and run a skewer or two through the slices. The skewer may seem fiddlely, but it makes turning the onion slices much easier.<br />
Take a big handful of asparagus (asparagi?), snap off the woody ends, and throw into a flat dish with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, a spoonful of brown sugar and  some red pepper flakes.<br />
Get your flank steak out of the fridge, salt and pepper it (I like Hy's seasoning salt) and let it come to room temp, at least an hour, an hour and half to two is even better.<br />
While the steak is getting to room temp and you're prepping the vegetables, start heating your barbeque. Now you want it hot, I mean really, really, hot; hotter than Johnny Depp, hotter than the hell that the makers of the Transformers movies deserve to roast in. Really fire that sucker up.<br />
Now throw everything on the the barbie, the steak, the asparagus, and the onions. Give your steak about five minutes on one side, flip it and give it two to three minutes on the other. Your steak should be rare, at the very most medium rare. At the same time the steak is cooking roll the asparagus around on the grill and flip the onions. You will be glad that you ran the skewers through the onions when you flip them. After the seven to eight minutes that it takes to cook the flank steak, remove it from the barbeque and place on a platter. Now this is a very crucial part; let the steak rest for ten minutes. Do not poke it, do not cut it, do not shake it, do not tease it. Just leave it alone, to meditate for ten minutes. Do not even talk to the steak, let it rest! Now while the steak is resting, you can start pulling the skewers out of the onions, separating the rings and placing on your serving dish. Your asparagus can go on another serving dish with the marinade (the marinade was only on your asparagus not the meat so it is safe). Now have you waited ten minutes? If you have you can start cutting the steak, on the bias, against the grain of the steak in 1/4 slices. The grain or fibres on a flank steak will be very obvious and you will be cutting your slices opposite to the fibres. Take your thin slices of steak and place on top of your grilled onions rings. I make a sauce of a couple of generous handfuls of parsley, 4 or five cloves of garlic, 1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil, and 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar. Buzz in a food processor. If you don't have a food processor, then start chop, chop, chopping the parsley and garlic and just mix the oil and vinegar in. You also could use the mortar and pestle. A spoonful of this with your flank steak slices is very good. Serve with baby new potatoes or rice made in the pot and a big friendly red wine. Your one cheap steak should feed four people. <br />

                    <p>Gah! Got beaten with a jambalaya recipe! Uh, here's mine...</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<p>1 cup of rice.<br />
4 oz. chicken.<br />
8 oz chicken broth.<br />
1 can of Rotel tomatoes.<br />
1 medium bell pepper, chopped.<br />
1 medium onion, chopped.<br />
1/2 stick of butter.<br />
2 tsp. cajun seasoning.<br />
1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce.<br />
1 tsp. hot sauce.<br />
1/2 tsp. salt.</p>

<p>Directions:</p>

<p>While I guess you could saute the vegitables or whatever, man up and throw everything in the pot, mix it together, and start cooking it. If necessary, use water to cover the mixture. You can add sasuage, but I'm a college student working in a small dorm room, and Smokey Links don't sound like something I'd put in jambalaya.</p>

<p>When the rice cooker clicks over, you're swell.</p>

                    <p>Chicken and Vegetables, adapted from memory of my Scout Master Dominick Caridi's recipe (so what I use now at home).</p>

<p>Rice (cover the bottom of The Pot about a half inch).<br />
Boneless Chicken Thighs, skinned (I usually have room for 2 or 3).<br />
Black Olives, pitted, to taste (the nice ones if you can).<br />
Pearl Onions (to taste).<br />
1 small jar Marinated Artichoke Hearts (use the liquid too).<br />
1 small jar Roasted red peppers, sliced if you like.<br />
1 small jar Capers.<br />
1 can stewed tomatoes, drained.<br />
1 small can marinated mushrooms (use the liquid too).<br />
Vegetable stock, enough to submerge everything (can be cut with water).<br />
A few bay leaves.<br />
Optional: Red Pepper Flakes, to taste (to spice it up if you like that).</p>

<p>Cook time: Till it's done.</p>

<p>Note: feel free to substitute fresh vegetables in for canned/jarred if you like.  Be sure to add Italian dressing (or similar) to add flavor if marinated artichokes/mushrooms are not used.  Just be sure to season it somehow.</p>

                    <p><b>Wild Mushroom Risotto</b></p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<p>2 tsp butter<br />
1 cup of diced onions<br />
1 tsp minced garlic<br />
1/4 cup of fresh Sage, chopped<br />
2 cups of wild mushrooms (I use Chantrelles for their taste and color)<br />
2 cups of Italian arborio rice (it's widely available)<br />
1/2 cup of white wine (Chardonnay works best)<br />
4 cups of chicken stock<br />
1 cup of heavy cream<br />
1/4 to 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese, grated. NOTE: buy a chunk of Parmesan.  Do not use pre-grated unless you have to.<br />
Salt and pepper</p>

<p>Directions:</p>

<p>Low temp.  Using a wooden spoon to stir, melt butter and sweat the onions, garlic and sage until almost clear; do not burn.  Add the mushrooms and saute until lightly colored (ie: usually takes about 4 minutes, they'll get a little brown.)  Add the arborio rice, and once the grains look slightly transparent, season with salt and pepper, to taste.</p>

<p>Now add the white wine and stir (ie: this is called deglazing.)  Next, add enough chicken stock to cover the rice with 1/2 inch of liquid and let simmer; stir frequently, and when the rice has absorbed most of the liquid - add more chicken stock. Repeat process when more liquid is needed.</p>

<p>NOTE: the secret to a great risotto is <i>patience.</i>  And it can only truly be made with love.  For it can take 45 minutes to make this and you can't walk away from it or rush it. In that sense, it's actually not a "slow cooker" recipe - rather, you can simply use one to make it!  So schedule this with doing your laundry or waiting for a download to finish; basically, whenever you need to kill 45 minutes.  But it'll be worth it; trust me. :)</p>

<p>When the rice is 90% cooked (it's still got a little bite to it or al dente) add the heavy cream and Parmesan cheese and continue cooking until the rice is creamy and thick enough to make a slight "mound" on a plate.  Ie: not too loose, not too thick.</p>

<p>The reason it takes 45 minutes to make this dish, it that you're essentially releasing the starches inside the arborio rice, while allowing it to absorb all the flavors and become "one with pot" so to speak.  The rice will have absorbed the very soul of your ingredients and if made correctly, you WILL see God. :)<br />

<p>I bought a rice cooker solely because of this article and have used it often since. I never imagined that when I started reading your movie reviews that one day you would also positively influence my culinary choices. I look forward to the book!</p>

<p>(I would submit a recipe but so far have not come up with anything on my own that is very interesting beyond the basic grains/meat/veggies. I've been meaning to try a soup or stew...)</p>

                    <p>Here you go, Roger!</p>

<p>The best shrimp & grits recipe comes from the late, great Bill Neal of Crook's Corner in Chapel Hill, NC. They also sell their own grits: http://www.crookscorner.com/ </p>

<p>The recipe: http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/dukemag/issues/030405/south-specialty1.html</p>

<p>"Shrimp and Grits<br />
Serves four<br />
Cheese grits (recipe below)<br />
1 pound fresh shrimp<br />
6 slices bacon<br />
Peanut oil<br />
2 cups sliced white button mushrooms<br />
1 cup minced scallions<br />
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced<br />
4 teaspoons lemon juice<br />
Tabasco sauce<br />
Salt and pepper<br />
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</p>

<p>Prepare grits and hold in a warm place or in a double boiler<br />
Peel shrimp, rinse, and pat dry<br />
Dice bacon and sautè lightly in a skillet until edges of the bacon are brown, but the bacon is not crisp. Remove from heat, drain on paper towels, then crumble.<br />
Add enough peanut oil top the pan to make a layer of fat about 1/8 inch thick. When oil is quite hot, add shrimp in an even layer. Turn shrimp as they color; add mushrooms, and sautè, stirring, for about 4 minutes.<br />
Add scallions and garlic. Heat and stir for about a minute more. Season with lemon juice, a dash or two of Tabasco, salt and pepper to taste, and parsley.<br />
Divide the grits among four plates. Spoon the shrimp on top, sprinkle with crumbled bacon, and serve immediately.</p>

<p>Cheese Grits<br />
1 cup stone-ground or quick grits <br />
(not instant)<br />
4 cups water (or milk, for creamier grits)<br />
1 cup grated cheddar cheese<br />
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese<br />
4 tablespoons butter<br />
1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
1/8 teaspoon pepper<br />
Pinch of cayenne pepper<br />
1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce</p>

<p>Cook grits according to package instructions for 1 cup of dry grits. Turn off heat and add remaining ingredients to sauce pan. Stir until just mixed and serve."</p>

<p><br />
I find that I don't need peanut/vegetable oil; the bacon makes enough grease to cook the mushrooms, scallions and shrimp. The recipe (as printed on my package of Crook's grits) also calls for a pinch of nutmeg with the pinches of cayenne and white pepper.<br />
And beware any version that requires chicken broth--if your shrimp are fresh, chicken broth is an abomination! </p>

<p><br />
No idea how to do that in a pot, but you could possibly make life easier by cooking the grits in a crockpot/pot while doing something else--cutting down on labor, essentially :)</p>

<p><b> Ebert: You surely could. Anson Mills advises for their Carolina Gold Rice Grits :</b></p>

<p><b> Time: 20 minutes on the stovetop or in an electric rice cooker</b></p>

<p><b> More plump and round than the term "grits" suggests, rice grits cook beautifully in an electric rice cooker, finishing like a million little beads with a magnetic attraction to each other. They are made to be sauced. Freshly cooked and plain, rice grits become profoundly comforting with a ladle or two of Sea Island red pea gravy thrown over them. Cooled slightly, sautéed with aromatics, and served with chicken and gravy, they approach a transforming experience. </b> </p>

                    <p>Hey Roger--</p>

<p>What was your opinion of the Chicago fois gras ban a few years back? </p>

<p>I'm just curious because I've recently been viewing YouTube videos of farms and slaughterhouses (interest not caused by the release of Food, Inc., although the timing certainly coincided). Although I've been disgusted by what I've seen--particularly in the poultry business--I am optimistic that retooling certain processes could, yes, raise the price of meat, but also result in actually treating these animals with due respect.</p>

<p>The production of fois gras, on the other hand, I believe is inherently cruel and unnatural, no matter how "pleasant" the farms are, as Anthony Bourdain (whose opinion I respect but frequently disagree with) would have us believe and focus on.</p>

<p>Any thoughts? </p>

<p>I tend to be moderate and cautious with most issues but I confess to a bleeding heart when it comes to animal rights...although I'm a hypocrite on the matter, since I still buy my meat from large grocery stores. Ideally, the only fair meat to eat is wild game--at least they lived a real life and had a fighting chance before the end.</p>

<p><b> Ebert: This is a funny, fascinating book about foie gras and the nature of humans and geese, written by a friend of mine at the Tribune:</b></p>

                    <p>The Mark Caro book on Foie Gras was very interesting. It taught me a lot about the process, more than humanized the farmers, and makes me want to retract my original "bleeding heart" comment because, should I tolerate that from myself, I may end up like some of those ridiculously uninformed protesters that are described in the anecdotes. Thanks for taking the time to recommend it.</p>

<p>PS. When you ask a rhetorical question and then answer yourself with "Well, sir..." (a la the review for the guinea pig spy nonsense), it always cracks me up because one of my smartass friends talks like that. I don't think you care, but it cleanses my spirit to mention it.</p>

<p>Take care.</p>

                    <p>Why oh why did I just now find this? You mean I could have saved us from high-fat/high price takeout while we were moving if only I hadn't packed the rice cooker? We got ours for 2000 tickets at Dave and Busters two years ago, and it's still going strong. I've just never thought to cook anything besides rice in it. Heck with unpacking the pots and pans- the rice cooker's next! </p>

                    <p>Hey, can't wait for the book to come out, as I love my rice cooker, but have never gotten around to trying anything "adventurous" on it yet. Not sure if this is at all helpful, but it's my basic rice recipe that satisfies my craving for something slightly salty, but which is better for you than, say, pizza or a cheeseburger. </p>

<p>1. Make white rice, but use less water than normal and instead add some soy sauce, and a squirt of that spicy red chili sauce in the bottle with the green lid and the Chinese characters on it. [Optionally, you could just make the rice normally, and add the sauces later]<br />
2. At some point while it's cooking, add a drained can of tuna (or don't drain it, whatever). <br />
3. When it's done, sprinkle sesame seeds on top. <br />
4. Eat it. I usually have a salad with no dressing and piece of fruit on the side. Enjoy! </p>

                    <p>Darn. I almost got one at Walmart today for thirteen bucks or so, because when I saw it (we were looking for a waffle maker, actually), I told my wife that there was this article on your blog about The Pot, but I hadn't read it yet. She told me "So, get it" and I said, "You know, let me read that article first and then we'll come back and get it". <br />
To tell you the truth, I was expecting to find recipes... but, ¿<i>textured soy protein</i>? ... I guess I'll wait for the book.<br />

                    <p>Glad to see someone who actually uses the rice cooker for other things aside from just rice.  I've never really gotten around to experimenting with it yet, aside from trying my hand at making congee.  As a college student, however, being able to toss a frozen fish and adding an egg and soy sauce have proven to be quite handy with rice, among other delicious alternatives.  </p>

<p>Zojirushi's fancy rice cookers are actually quite spectacular.  My mom has only just upgraded our rice cooker from the previous one (ten years strong from almost DAILY use).  I've seen wondrous things concocted.  I have to ask my mom, but one of the things she makes quite well is steamed fried rice.  I have to ask her for the exact recipe, but it involves chopped duck and liver sausage, shiitake mushrooms, bok choi, and some type of sauce.  To be continued...</p>

                    <p>When my Mom married my Dad, he apparently missed his mother's (my Bubbie Zelda's) home cooked tongue. Wanting to please him, my Mom sought the recipe from the source. Finally Bubbie Zelda surrendered it, and I share it, in its entirety, with you below:</p>

<p>"Put it in the pot with the ingredients and cook it 'til it's done."</p>

<p>I know it's past your cookbook deadline but I bet this would work with a rice cooker too. You're welcome.</p>

                    <p>Dear Roger, </p>

<p>I read this post on rice cookers a year ago but consulted it again just now because Amazon notified me of a small appliance sale and I had committed prior to my recent birthday to finally geting a Zojirushi rice cooker. I was at a Korean friend's home recently where of course a rice cooker was set up for guests to serve themselves. When I asked her if she preferred that brand, she replied in the affirmative but still gave me a funny look like she didn't really get the point of the question. I think it may have been like asking "Do your kitchen faucets work well?" A rice cooker cooks rice. Like the children's book says "Everybody cooks rice."</p>

<p>I thought I remembered how much I loved this blog among the many of yours that inspire me. I almost started to explain it to someone once and stopped myself. It's a blog about the wonders of a rice cooker and you just can't explain that except to say that it's so much more. In any case, I was wrong. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed reading this not-so-simple blog. It holds life lessons disguised as an appliance recommendation: Priceless.<br />

                    <p>Just saw the cover on Twitter. That's a hell of a sub-title. Any news on a release date? Any chance my recipe got in?</p>

<p>I just noticed that "Your Movie Sucks" was released on Kindle. Strange, as I thought one was able to read websites on the thing, albeit in gray-scale. I imagine the cover scowl isn't as fierce, dot-matricized. </p>

 Who knew such divine soliloquies, though didactic they are no less profound, could be derived from a pot with a button?<br />
 An idea for your book title, if you haven't already thought of one: 'The Pot; the art of cooking simply.'<br />
 Thanks for the smile.</p>

                    <p>I've been using a rice cooker since forever, but I bought my first neuro-fuzzy Zojirushi a year ago. </p>

<p>It really is worth the extra money and learning curve.</p>

<p>I use the timer feature frequently.  (Mine has two memories, which I set for breakfast or dinner time.)   That way, I can wake up to fresh oatmeal or grits, or come home from work with dinner ready.  </p>

<p>You set the time you want your food to be ready, put in your dried goods and water, and let it do its magic.</p>

<p>I presoak dried beans the night before, set the timer for when I get home from work the next night and the brown rice setting and, presto!<br />
(It's also the most energy-efficient way to cook dried beans.)</p>

<p>Steel-cut oatmeal and grits cook on the porridge setting.</p>

<p>Magic.  </p>

<p>BTW, I work in a CS research group.  All the guys have the neuro-fuzzy and love it, but we have no idea what kind of algorithm Zojirushi uses.  Perhaps it is a trade secret.</p>

<p>Last time I visited my mom, she had a bought herself a neuro-fuzzy Zojirushi, too.  She said that it was the best rice cooker she's ever owned.  Too bad she had to wait 70 years to learn that.<br />

                    <p>Roger, the neuro-fuzzy cookers use the weight of the rice instead of how much water has boiled off to determine if the rice is done. That requires a great deal of buttonry that is undone by the simplicity of the recommended model.</p>

Am I wrong on that? Tarantino seems to be on a streak with this methodology:  a blaxplotation film as a crime mystery, a karate flick as an operatic western, a feminist horror film, and now a sixty year late propaganda film. In his own way he should be as controversial as von Trier. Oh well.<br />

                    <p>Roger,</p>

<p>My sainted mother taught me to rinse all white rice twice. Swish it for twenty seconds or so, drain, then rinse again. Then cover the rice with enough water to the level of one knuckle. For some reason this rule of, er, knuckle, works whether you're using a plain pot on a stove or a rice cooker and whether you're making three cups or eight. It always worked for us. I've got two generations of restaurateurs on both sides of my family and that's how they did it. (My maternal grandfather was the maitre'd of the original Ruby Foo's on Broadway.)</p>

<p>I am the only one in my family who will eat brown rice. Even my cardiologist and my internist -- both Asian-Americans -- prefer white rice, but they applaud my choice.</p>

<p>The next time you make your rice, add a handful of lentils. They add a nice little flavor note and a bit more fiber. Sometimes, to change things up, I'll drain the liquid off a can of chopped tomatoes (saving the tomatoes for another recipe) and add a pinch of cumin. I also like to cut off the stumps of my cauliflower or broccoli and chop them up into chunks and add them to rice as it cooks. I would rather eat the florets on their own.</p>

<p>Thank you, kenn</p>

                    <p>@Jenna: consider this thought experiment: imagine filling up your pot-over-a-flame with rice and water, turning it on, and going to work.  Advise any pets/residents of the house and fire department before trying this.  After the pot is dug out of the rubble the rice still won't taste good, and even my local Korean joint won't go to so much trouble to prepare rice.<br />
Like Roger said, we don't need to know exactly how it cooks, but it certainly cooks differently.</p>

                    <p>One of my most used kitchen appliances, (almost daily) is my little $10 from the corner drugstore rice cooker. 3 settings cooking, warming, and OFF.</p>

<p>What a trooper, I cook rice in it (obvy) which becomes either a side dish, or Onigiri, or... </p>

<p>smothered chicken:<br />
chicken broth in the pot(as if water for rice)<br />
appropriate amount of rice,<br />
diced chicken<br />
spiced as you like</p>

<p>as the broth is hot you put in the rice and the chicken bits. simmer till it says it's done.</p>

<p><br />
I've also done matzo ball soup (per matzo meal pkg directions and cooking the matzo balls in Chicken broth) </p>

<p>several random soups, (what's in the fridge soup)</p>

                    <p>To make terrific french onion soup:</p>

<p>Buy six pounds of short ribs.  Rub with salt, pepper, and any herbs you like (marjoram is good).  Roast in a pyrex pan for about 7 hours at 220 degrees.  Yes, I said 220 degrees.  </p>

<p>They will come out beautifully browned, roasted, and the meat will be coming off the bones.</p>

<p>Put meat and bones into The Pot with 1/2 bunch of celery, cut up.  Cover with fresh, lightly salted water to make about 8 cups.  Cook overnight on low, low simmer.  In the morning strain out bones, meat, et al, and add about 6 medium carrots, peeled and sliced.  Cook for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>Decant the mixture, strain out cooked carrots, and put broth in the refrigerator.  In the morning, you can easily lift off the caked tallow from the surface, and you're left with a rich, brown, virtually fatless broth.</p>

<p>If you do everything properly, you will end up with about six cups or so.</p>

<p>Use the broth as a base for Julia Child's French Onion Soup recipe (http://www.grouprecipes.com/24870/julia-child-french-onion-soup.html), and you will have a soup for the ages...</p>

                    <p>Great piece, Roger. I'd like to add a bit to the origin story for Worcestershire Sauce. The colonel did indeed serve in India, fell in love with the original version and prevailed upon the local producers to give him the recipe. Dreaming of building a lucrative business, once back in England, he hired Mr. Lea and Mr. Perrins to assemble the ingredients. When the task was complete, the chemists contacted the colonel, who sampled the batch and pronounced that it "tastes like dirt!" Thinking that the apothecaries had failed in their task, he angrily left without paying them, leaving them with several barrels of the stuff. Several weeks passed before they got to the task of disposing of the mixture. In that time the fermentation process occurred, transforming the dirt tasting mixture into the savory elixer we all now enjoy with our grilled cheese. I don't what happened to the colonel.<br />

                    <p>Terrific! I love how posters are sharing their rice cooker stories. Here's mine: </p>

<p>I'm Japanese-Canadian, so of course rice cookers have always been a mainstay. Right now we have a 10-cup Zojirushi. When my boyfriend moved away for school, my parents gave him his very own little 3-cup Tiger rice cooker as a going away present. It's adorable. And frequently used.</p>

<p>I loved the tone of this article -- madcap and zesty. </p>

                    <p>Really nice post, here is my recipe. </p>

<p>Velouté de légumes</p>

<p>One head of broccoli (If you don’t love broccoli then you don’t put broccoli).<br />
2 carrots<br />
2 potatoes<br />
1 onion<br />
2 branches of celery<br />
1 liter of chicken broth (could also be vegetable broth)<br />
¼ Cup of milk (could be fresh cream)</p>

<p>Cut everything in small cube and put it in the pot. Wait for the carrot to be well cooked and stop the pot (carrot is the longest thing to cook).</p>

<p>Let it rest for 5 min approx, add the milk and mix everything with a hand blender (which is an essential for me in the kitchen). </p>

<p>Then all you have to do is adjust the seasoning. Salt. Pepper. Fresh herbs could be good. Some parmesan on top will do the job (parmesan always do the job). A tea spoon of curry could also be a good idea. One splash of olive oil and you’re ready to go.</p>

<p>This is a winner every time. Tasty. Full of vitamins. Could be served as an entrée or a main dish with croutons and cheese.<br />

                    <p>I know I'm way too late with the recipes. But I too am a huge rice-cooker fan. </p>

<p>Unlike many cooks, I have never had trouble making perfect rice on the stove-top. I got a rice cooker because it had a timer feature and I wanted to have fresh rice ready to go with the curry in the slowcooker after a long workday, and there for my family even if I got home late. Now I use it all the time as it's so easy. I usually measure the water, but I think the one-knuckle rule works fine too (and it's doable in the rice cooker because the water is cold, not boiling, when the measuring is done). </p>

<p>The other thing I use it for (aside from the overnight steel-cut oats) is cooking polenta, which is comfort food from my Balkan heritage. I realized this was possible when I read how the cookers actually work (boils till the water is gone, then drops to low). I bring the water to a boil, then open the lid and add a cup or two of cornmeal, which I have already saturated with cold water. Stir in, cover, and test when it switches to low; if it still has an uncooked taste I add a few spoons of water which tricks the heating element to turn back on. This is the easiest way to do polenta--there is no whisking, no standing and stirring, no lumps--so revolutionizes it much more than it does the cooking of rice.</p>

<p>The other thing that works in it is South African-style white cornmeal porridge or "mielie-meal", which is eaten as the grain staple with meat and sauce. The cooking technique is different--measure cold water and add the meal to it, cook till it switches to warm setting and keep it there for at least 30 minutes so it gets a bit crusty at the edges. I've never had grits, and I'm curious which cornmeal-cooking method is closer to the way to cook grits.</p>

<p><b> Ebert: I like your empirical approach: When first trying it, stand by to add some water. Also, use chicken broth, etc., if you want flavor.</b> </p>

                    <p>I thank you for this ebert, as an unemployed, creative, drifter (loser) who has no future plans for settling down any time soon. I've owned this thing for three days and already I've made oatmeal, chili, breakfast skillets, stir frys and chili. I'm an absolute convert of minimalist cooking, in fact before this I cooked all of my meals in a single small pan over the stove.</p>

<p>I submit this one very simple, healthy, cheap recipe:</p>

<p>Pseudo-italian chicken and mushroom chili (emphasis on it being pseudo italian, not pseudo chicken chili)</p>

<p>1 can chili beans in sauce (I buy the Bush's brand, it's cheap)<br />
1 can italian diced tomatoes, with water<br />
1 lb chicken breast (I buy it in bulk frozen<br />
1/2 cup mushrooms, chopped (best if precooked or canned)<br />
Chili powder<br />
Flour (Or any thickening agent)<br />
Jalapenos* (Omit if you don't like spicy food)<br />
Pepper to taste</p>

<p>Cook up the chicken, jalapenos* and the mushrooms in some water at the bottom of the pot. Once it has boiled up remove the chicken and chop it to bits. Then throw in your can of tomatoes and chili, let that boil up and add in some more water if it looks too thin. After a few minutes of boiling up add in your chili powder to taste and 1-3 tbsp of flour (Depending on how much sauce you want) And stir it up and let it sit there for however long you want everything to meld together. </p>

<p>This makes me four servings for less than four dollars (Well in Florida i have no idea how much this stuff costs elsewhere) it tastes like a mixture between traditional chili and minestrone. I eat it every day. Good deal. </p>

<p><b> Ebert: You've got the spirit.</b></p>

                    <p>With the sizes, does a 3 cup mean it can hold 3 cups of rice? and is that cooked or uncooked? What other kinds of things can you make in a rice cooker?</p>

                    <p>I pre-ordered your book some time ago but only just now discovered this blog post.  A question: is your admonition against fuzzy-logic rice cookers based solely on cost, or do you think that they don't work as well for this type of cooking?  I ask because I already have a Zojirushi fuzzy-logic model and don't really want to purchase another Pot.</p>

<p><b> Ebert: That will work just fine, and allow you to make more complicated stuff. It's just that there's no <i>need </i> to spend the money. A little 3-cup Pot for around $10 can get someone started.</b> </p>

                    <p>Great article, Roger; I'm definitely going to be getting a copy of the new book!</p>

<p>I'm adding a recipe I came up with recently.</p>

<p>Make some Texmati rice (I usually throw in a tad of butter and some salt a la the directions on the side of the package).</p>

<p>While the rice is cooking, cut up around 4-6 stalks of green onions and pan-fry with a little Pam until they're just this side of brown.  </p>

<p>Do the same thing with 4-6 cloves of garlic sliced as thin as you're able.  (The concept of 'too much garlic' doesn't exist for me, and you might want to go a little tamer.)</p>

<p>Finally, take a stalk of cilantro and start chopping it up from the leaf end until you start getting more stems than leaves; a good handful of this is all you need.</p>

<p>Once the rice is done, stir in the cilantro, onions and garlic... and, voila :-)</p>

                    <p>I'm Cuban and we have had rice cookers since way back when.  The favorite, or most readily available in Florida is the Hitachi chime-o-matic. </p>

<p>We eat rice practically every day and it makes PERFECT rice every time.  I have never tried making anything else in it though.  </p>

<p>One of our family favorites?  Arroz con Salchichas.  Yellow rice with Vienna Sausage.  Saute your onions, green peppers, garlic in a little olive oil, add it to your rice, put in a packet of the McCormick "Sazon Seasoning" the one with Culantro and Anichote (corriander and Annatto) and throw in a few cans of Vienna Sausage (must be the pork, chicken and beef variety).  Sometimes my mom would also throw in a can of corn kernals.  I'm telling you, this is true Cuban comfort food.  And of course very economical, fast and quick to make (ready in 20 minutes) and simply delicious.</p>

<p>Try it, you'll like it.  I can't wait to get your book and see what else I can do on my Hitachi.</p>

                    <p>Just read the article in the NY Times, pre-ordered the book, and started in on this blog.  Well, I have a larger rice cooker and it cooks rice wonderfully, but I never tried it even once for anything else.  It never occurred to me.  I thought I'd give it all a try.  Here's what I did:  I had about a pound of beef stew meat frozen in the fridge.  I dumped it in the cooker frozen, found some beef broth (did the smell test -- it passed) and poured it in.  Found some celery and parsley which I chopped roughly and threw it in.  Added a variety of spices from my cabinet like Greek seasoning, dash of Cajun, onion salt, some garlic from a jar, several dashes of Worchestershire sauce and topped it all off with some basmati rice, which I totally forgot to wash.  About two hours later and my, my, MY what a wonderful and quick meal I turned out.  My lady -- a Senegalese used to rice dishes -- came by and marvelled at my concoction.  Success, success, success!  And I didn't even break a sweat!  Thank you King Roger.  My next child will be named after you.</p>

                    <p>My rice cooker arrived on my birthday yesterday as I wanted but it didn't get here till evening so I decided not to make any rice till today.  I went to make it today using a 3 or 4 different rice combo that I got at Costco sometime in the past, who knows when.  The jar was about 1/3 full, I googled shelf life of rice and decided to throw the rice out so I still haven't been able to make any.  I was going to use chicken broth instead of water because my rice always tastes so blah but the instruction book says use cold water.  What do you think?  I preordered your book from Amazon and when I checked it said what the expected date I should get it and I'm thinking that means the Tuesday before that it will be at Costco.  Do you know how hard that will be to not buy it at Costco instead of waiting for it to come from Amazon?<br />

                    <p>A few days ago I reported a successful use of my rice cooker (see above posting).  I'm a total kitchen klutz and was delighted that the rice cooker seemed to be klutz-proof.  Well, I tried Mr. Ebert's oatmeal basics today and, man, did I have a not-so-wonderful experience.  I went to my local big-to-do health food market looking for "stone ground" oatmeal.  Well, they had every variation under the sun EXCEPT stone ground.  So I opted for "steel cut," whatever the heck that is.  For one serving they suggested 1/4 cup of oatmeal, pretty puny for a manly man such as myself, so I doubled it to 1/2 cup and the 3 cups water the box directions called for.  Turned the rice cooker on and went back to my Sunday paper (the news wasn't particularly good today, I might add).  I heard the "click" and went to check out the pot.  It had boiled over big time, a slurmy mess all over my kitchen counter, dripping down onto the cabinet underneath.  Not fun cleaning all that up.  So I decided to give the resulting oatmeal the taste test.  Mr. Ebert likes his oatmeal "al dente."  What I ate was hard enough to break your dentes.  It felt like I was eating cattle feed.  I've never had a boil over before with my rice cooker.  So oatmealers, beware that you may be limited to a very small serving unless you want a mess on your hands.  And you may want to stick with the "Better For Thee Than Me" guy rather than the expensive box of cow chow I bought from the health food emporium.</p>

                    <p>Duncan’s Barley Dal Recipe<br />
(You can also make Kicheree by substituting Rice for the Barley)</p>

<p>1. Rice Cooker <br />
Start with a Rice Cooker with a Steamer Insert (I use a Lotus Foods-brand Rice Cooker, $80, solid stainless steel, purchased from the At Home Store in Fairfield, Iowa). There’s also a Stainless Steel Rice Cooker available at the MUM Bookstore, and at Everybody’s, for $70. The Miracle Exclusives Rice Cooker is available from Amazon.com for $60 plus shipping. All of these are very similar; stainless steel throughout, same warm/cook switch, same steamer tray.</p>

<p>2.a Recipe (based on 1 cup dry ingredients—modify all amounts based on amount of dry ingredients)</p>

<p>2.b. Quantity<br />
Makes 48 oz (approx. 4-6 servings) </p>

<p>2.c. Ingredients and Preparation<br />
·	1/2 cup pearled barley (organic preferred, from Whole Foods, $2/lb. You can use “hulled” barley, but it doesn’t plump up as nice because it has the hull still on it.)<br />
·	1/2 cup split mung dal (organic preferred, I get mine from Everybody's in Fairfield, Iowa in 25-lb bags for ca. $65 plus shipping. It lasts forever.) [Dal is a high-protein Legume like Peas or Lentils. It is very popular in India; there are many types of Dal available; I like Mung Dal.]<br />
·	Put the barley and dal in the cooking pan. Add water and swirl around the water to wash the dry ingredients. Then pour the water out. Repeat 2-3 more times or until the water is clear, not cloudy. Pour off the clear water.)<br />
·	Add 4 cups of pure good-tasting water to the rice cooker pan. (If you can plan ahead, set aside the water and grains to soak overnight; this step is not critical, but nice. It makes the cooking time shorter and is said to reduce the gas in the dal.)<br />
·	Add 2 tbsp oil (prefer extra virgin olive oil, or grape seed oil, or sesame oil, or ghee (clarified butter). This oil is the secret ingredient that helps stop your rice cooker from making a mess on the counter and the floor when the dal/rice/barley boils and threatens to overflow.<br />
·	2-3 tsp of Maharishi Ayurveda Vata, Pita or Kapha Churna (seasoning). This is a spice/herb mixture with calming (vata) cooling (pita) or stimulating (kapha) qualities. I use Vata or Pitta Churna. (Available from the Health and Wholeness Store in Fairfield, Iowa, ca. $15 for the 8-oz. (large) size plus shipping. (You can also buy generic Pitah, Vatah, and Kaphah spice mixtures at Everybody's, Fairfield, IA.) (Note: Vata Churna Ingredients: Cumin, Ginger, Fenugreek, Turmeric, Turbinado Sugar, Salt, and Asafoetida (Hing) in a Rice-flower base; Pitta Churna Ingredients: Coriander, Fennel, Cumin, Turbinado Sugar, Cardamom, Ginger, Turmeric, Cinnamon, and Salt. Kapha Churna Ingredients: Ginger, Pepper, Coriander, Turbinado Sugar, Turmeric, Salt and Cinnamon.) <br />
·	1 tsp ground ginger powder<br />
·	1 tsp ground fennel<br />
·	1-3 tsp whole fennel seeds (adds nice texture)<br />
·	a couple of healthy shakes of ground turmeric<br />
·	a couple of shakes of ground coriander [optional; this is also in Vata or Pitta Churna]<br />
·	a couple of shakes of ground cumin [optional; this is also in Vata or Pitta Churna]<br />
·	¼ tsp of Asafoetida (aka Hing), ground fine (I get mine from Everybody's in Fairfield, IA. This is a pungent ingredient made from a crystallized plant sap that adds a lot of flavor with just a little bit added.)<br />
·	Several whole Bay Leaves (discard after cooking)<br />
·	Several Curry Leaves (adds a pungent flavor)<br />
·	1/8-1/4 tsp of Sea Salt or Real Salt, or none and salt/pepper to taste at table). [optional; I avoid all salt in cooking]<br />
·	1 tbsp of chopped dried Chives<br />
·	1 tbsp chopped dried Cilantro<br />
·	1 tbsp chopped dried basil</p>

<p>3. Cooking<br />
·	Plug in the Ricer Cooker. Turn on the switch for cooking on the rice cooker (with the Lotus, flip the switch down).<br />
·	Add the steamer insert on top of the cooking pan. Wash and dice up your favorite vegetables.<br />
·	Some of My Favorite Vegetables:<br />
o	A couple of carrots (always)<br />
o	Some stalks of celery (very good, diced small) (often)<br />
o	½ a head of cauliflower diced small (sometimes)<br />
o	A stalk of broccoli diced small (sometimes). <br />
o	1/4-1/2 pound of asparagus diced small (delish) (sometimes)<br />
o	A couple of small potatoes diced small (instead of the cauliflower/broccoli) (sometimes) (starchy, but tasty; I have them 1-2 times/wk—lots of potassium)<br />
o	5-15 Brussels sprouts (diced smaller if large) (a nice variation instead of broccoli) (sometimes)<br />
o	Greens like chard or bokchoi (excellent, finely chopped). (sometimes)<br />
o	A handful of green beans diced small (sometimes)<br />
o	etc. etc. Pick your favorites, try them out.<br />
·	Go and meditate (or whatever).<br />
·	45 minutes to 1½ hr. later, it's all ready. After it finishes the main cooking cycle, it automatically switches to warm. So, no burning the cooking pan (or your food). You can leave it to cook further for up to an hour after the 45-minute cooking phase finishes with no bad results. Unplug the Rice Cooker. Stir the Barley Dal, then stir in the veggies. You're now ready to eat, or to scoop it into a wide-mouth food Thermos (I own two 24-oz. Thermos-Brand Stainless steel wide-mouth food thermoses (I got the latest one from Amazon.com). The Barley Dal with Veggies recipe described above fills them both up neatly.<br />
·	Note on grains: You can vary the grains. For instance, you can substitute Organic Brown Basmati Rice for the Barley. Since the dal takes 45 minutes to cook, I use a matched grain that also takes a similar time to cook. (This is why I don’t use Quinoa or White Basmati rice.) Wild rice is wonderful as well; it also takes about 45 minutes to cook. (I’ve tried 1/3 cup dal, 1/3 cup brown rice, and 1/3 cup wild rice—it came out great! I’ve also tried 1/3 cup dal, 1/3 cup brown rice, and 1/3 cup barley—again, delicious!). ¼ cup wild rice, ¼ cup dal, ¼ cup pearled barley, and ¼ cup brown rice was quite good, also.<br />
·	Note on dal: You can use split peas or split lentils or other types of dal instead of mung dal. I just really like the taste of mung dal.<br />
·	Note on Dal boiling over: Dal has a tendency when cooked by itself in a rice cooker (or in a pan on the stove for that matter) to boil over and make a mess on your stove or countertop. Ways to prevent this: 1) Cock the lid of the rice cooker or pot so that the dal doesn’t boil over. 2) Put 1-3 TBSP of oil into the Dal at the start of cooking 3) Put vegetables (or whatever) in the steamer insert above the cooking pan. This will prevent the overflow altogether. 5) Put the Rice Cooker onto a plate so that, if there is any overflow, it ends up on the plate and not on your counter 6) Don’t cook the Dal all by itself. The addition of Barley and or Rice and or Wild Rice seems to prevent or reduce boil-over.<br />
·	The grain provides the texture; the legume provides the soup-like quality.</p>

                    <p>Ok, I got my rice cooker a few weeks ago, the Zojirushi 10 cup, and the rice I've made has turned out great, including brown rice and a rice mixture from Costco.  When I went to make oatmeal this morning I wanted to try making it in The Pot but wasn't sure about a couple things so I chickened out.  First, if a person is making something other than rice, like oatmeal, should I still always measure using the "cup" that came with the rice cooker as a cup of oatmeal or whatever?  Obviously the cup that came with it isn't actually a cup in measurements.  I'm not like Aunt Mary and am a little nervous about experiments but I'm going to try to be more willing to try as I get to know my Pot.  I did put cut up bananas and peaches on my husbands oatmeal though instead of brown sugar and he seemed to like it.  Baby steps!  By the way, I got your book last Wednesday and love it!<br />

<p><b> Ebert: Doesn't matter. It's one Thingie of oatmeal to two Thingies of water. Or maybe two and a splash. Be sure to add some fruit or berries. A banana and some blueberries, for example.</b> </p>

                    <p>Yesterday, my husband and I traveled to St. Pete. Florida to celebrate my mothers 91st birthday.  Minutes after we arrived, she showed off a book she had been on the waiting list to receive...'The Pot...'</p>

<p>We were taking her to an old Greek fishing village for lunch, (an hours drive), and I while she and my husband chatted, I sat in the back seat and read the entire book.</p>

<p>Had a wonderful lunch in Tarpon Springs, Fl., and on the way back, she asked that we stop and get 'the pot.'  I ran into a mega-store and bought the simplest one they had...Then another stop to buy rice, oatmeal and lentils.</p>

<p>Upon arriving back at her house, we proceeded to make oatmeal, and the words 'the pot knows' became the slogan of the day.</p>

<p>Have to share this though...Years ago I took many cooking classes from a Chinese woman and she showed how to make perfect rice every time using any one pot and no measuring instruments. </p>

<p> Also, the reason for rinsing the rice is to remove starch.  If you want the rice to be separate, fluffy,  and not sticky then rinse off the starch.  If you want the rice to be sticky and sweet, don't rinse.  </p>

<p>Thank for the book Roger...She's going to have fun with it,<br />
Katie</p>

                    <p>I was telling my husband yesterday how The Pot only has cook and warm settings and if I make brown rice it will switch to warm much later than if I make white rice and he kept asking me how The Pot knows, is it the weight of what I'm cooking and I told him that it's just a mystery.  It's probably going to drive him nuts figuring it out.  I actually know from something I read on here or in the book but I'll just leave him guessing.</p>

In September, insurance company AmeriChoice brings trucks to blighted neighborhoods in New York City and gives away coupons for free chickens as an incentive for the underprivileged to switch their Medicare coverage. New York state senator Carl Kruger files a complaint with the state attorney general. The 101 Dumbest Moments In Business 2003 EDITION - April 1, 2003   Apr 1, 2003 ...

<p>2009 and 2010 $120,000 from your tax dollars at work<br />
Philadelphia PA Mayor Nutter received two years in a row $60,000 checks to help keep open and operate the city swimming pools. These checks came from AmeriChoice Health and on the surface seems like fine gifts. Yet, they are Bribes non the less, these checks come from a company who receives all its money from the Federal State Governments as a vendor for Medicare Medicaid services is not allowed to offer bribes kickbacks and money gifts of any kind in order to promote its share of the market place. This is also not allowed as a use of your taxpayers dollars yet it happens.What does it really cost the City of Philadelphia to receive this money? Americhoice Health has a long history of corruption over the years yet seems to be protected by those who are responsible to over see their actions why is that? Sorry must apologize just received a notice that AmeriChoice Health was under the impression they thought they were suppose to have started their very own stimulus and economic program package and the one they implemented, they had no idea it violated all the Stark ,Health and Kickbacks laws. Some one will have to notify the following departments it was all a mistake or error in judgement, the Department of Justice, CMS, Dept of health and Human resourses,the FBI,and IRS, and any other agency effected by this tragedy or unfortunate misunderstanding. No harm, no fowl, forgive and forget, OK, then how about some coupons for a free whole fried chicken.....<br />
 <br />
Among its provisions, the anti-kickback statute penalizes anyone who knowingly and willfully solicits, receives, offers or pays remuneration in cash or in kind to induce, or in return for: A. Referring an individual to a person for the furnishing, or arranging for the furnishing, of any item or service payable under the Medicare or Medicaid program; or B. Purchasing, leasing or ordering , or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering, any goods, facility, service or item payable under the Medicare or Medicaid program. Violators are subject to criminal penalties, or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid rograms, or both. A violation of the anti-kickback law is a felony offense that carries criminal fines of up to $25,000 per violation, imprisonment for up to five years and exclusion from government health care programs.The federal anti-kickback statute, 42 U.S.C.§ 1320a-7b(b), prohibits individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce referrals of items or services covered by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federally funded program. </p>

<p>If this were any one person not a corporation they would be in jail now, if the FBI were called in on this matter they would be in jail now, if the IRS were notified they would be in jail now. Since all Ameri-Choice checks come from the United Health's home office they should be held equally responsible for any bribes, kickbacks, Stark, Fraud and inducements violations that have occured. Federal and State Governments have developed such a depended position with this company that laws and rules no longer apply for them.This role is nothing new for the AmeriChoice people and its been going on for years, look at some of the prior news articles that date back for years only now they can afford to hire the best of Law firms and give the most for Political contributations all on the back of the taxpayer. Sure the Laws have become tighter but you can still dance away their problems. <br />
 <br />
Three years ago they were reported to these Federal agency's and as of todays date not only were they allowed to continue doing business but were never charged once. Protected vendor status sure, politics sure,limited government budgets sure, Federal and State officals looking the other way sure, and rather then stop these activities a strong desire not to rock the boat existed. Even with the vast changes in the laws and budgets,a hands off policy remains, you tell me what's wrong with this picture? The Government created this monster and now they don't know what to do about it, like shooting yourself in your own foot etc. Tons of money to advance their national growth, its market positions, tons of money for political donations, tons of money to send 75 millon back to its home office from New York state alone, tons of money to suppot National TV shows, tons of money to pay hugh State fines, tons of money to hire the very best law firms, tons of money to pay for bribes and kickbacks, tons of money for hugh salarys and bonuses, all done on the back of the American taxpayor, you see this company receives all its money from the Federal government. Should your tax dollars be held to a higher standard? Should the government agencys responsible for there review be held to that same standard?Should the IRS audit their corruption? Why has this company not been charged? How long can the buck be passed here in more ways then one? Hey, it's your tax dollars don't complain now then don't complain later. <br />

                    <p>My gigantic crock pot can swallow your puny rice cooker in one bite! BWAA! HA! HA!</p>

<p>Anyway, contributions to the war against low-salt blandness follow:</p>

<p>01. The best, as usual, comes from Trader's Joes. Try the "21 Seasoning Salute". Absolutely amazing - no salt. Trader Joe's also makes a Chile Pepper Sauce with zero sodium. Zero. </p>

<p>02. The Spice Hunter brand has about a dozen no-salt seasoning mixes, some of which are pretty good. </p>

<p>03. McIlhenny's original pepper sauce has only 1% USRDA sodium (compared with the 3% in Lee & Perrins worcestershire). </p>

<p>People may say that they don't like hot sauce, but they should get the Chile Pepper Sauce from Trader Joes and the McIlhenny's original pepper sauce anyway. If you add *tiny* amounts of chile/pepper sauce to anything, you get the sensation that your food contains salt (even though it doesn't) but without the heat. The no-salt chile sauce from Trader Joe's is so good that I'd like to have it tested in a lab 'cuz I'm suspicious of anything that perfect. </p>

<p>Kudos on your Pulitzer, Hemingway.</p>

<p><b> Ebert: Few people know that Lea & Perrins Worcestershire is  very low salt, and its "no salt" version even lower. You really don't need salt.</b> </p>

                    <p>Because of my deep and abiding love for you Roger, I am going to share my recipe for Crock Pot Curried Potatoes. I guess you could use a rice pot to make this if you are stubborn.</p>

<p>Ingredients: </p>

<p>------------</p>

<p>01. 1 large potato, sweet potato, or yam.</p>

<p>02. Spice Hunter no-salt curry powder to taste.</p>

<p>03. Extra virgin olive oil.</p>

<p>04. 1 teaspoon Trader Joe's no salt hot sauce. </p>

<p>05. No salt garlic powder to taste.</p>

<p>06. 1 teaspoon Xylitol sugar or other healthy sugar substitute. </p>

<p>Instructions: </p>

<p>-------------</p>

<p>01. Dice the potato. Place in crock pot/rice cooker to cook thoroughly.</p>

<p>02. When the potatoes are soft, douse liberally with olive oil, then add all of the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly. So good. </p>

<p>Of course, the real point of having a humongous crock pot is that you can make a vast quantity of any recipe and then parcel it up in the freezer for healthy, low-salt homemade frozen dinners. </p>

                    <p>One thing I'm a tad surprised that no one's mentioned yet is use of a pot as tool for steamboat (or if you must 'chinese fondue' or 'hot pot'. Not what we called it back home mind you) - and for this, the simpler the better, fuzzly logic be dammed.</p>

<p>Such things really do lend themselves to cold winter evenings with friends and family sitting round a table talking about whatever you do. The pot takes pride of place in the centre, filled with water gently boiling and bubbling away while each throws in whatever is handy - vegetables, noodles, meats, eggs - and picks it out when done to their liking. </p>

<p>By it's very nature, you tend to jostle arms a bit, and you have to accept that someone is going to pluck out that perfectly cooked egg you've been giving just a moment longer to cook <i>(sigh)</i> but that's half the fun and by night's end, you've inevitably eaten your fill and there's a lovely soup in the pot from all those bits in and out of the pot.</p>

                    <p>I read How to Use the Pot last night. It was fantastic. I wrote about it in my blog if you or any of your readers are interested in reading it.<br />
http://notexactlyaquote.tumblr.com/post/2650488369/the-pot-and-how-to-use-it-a-book-review-and-more</p>

<p>Tonight, I’m going to depart from my norm of posting movie reviews, and try my hand with a book review. The book in question: The Pot and How to Use it: The Mystery and Romance of the Rice Cooker by Roger Ebert.</p>

<p>Several of my posts have referenced my admiration of Mr. Ebert. As I’ve said, he is one of two sources of inspiration on my beloved topic of film. But that is not the subject of his book or of my post. It is that of the rice cooker.</p>

<p>Ebert’s recent battle with cancer resulted in a surgery removing his lower jaw and depriving him of the ability to speak or eat. This in turn resulted in him taking on a more massive online presence. He is Twitter and Facebook and he created a new blog where he discusses a myriad of topics, not strictly film. I am a regular reader. One of his recent posts was about his upcoming book on the rice cooker.</p>

<p>I told Mom about the post under the misconception it was referring to a crock pot. She bought me one for Christmas and I later bought Ebert’s book to accompany the gift. Upon glancing through the book, we realized that it was talking about the rice cooker not the crockpot. In my ignorance I had thought they were the same thing. Apparently they’re not. Don’t worry, I’m sure my crock pot will come in handy and be well-used too. So we went off to Wal-Mart to locate the proper appliance:a Rival six-cup rice cooker for thirteen bucks (Mom even got herself one – an Aroma eight cup rice cooker for a few dollars more). We went home and experimented with them cooking eggs in mine and long grain brown rice in Mom’s. By the way, I’ve since learned the difference between a crock pot and a rice cooker. The crock pot is a slow cooker with a thermostat.The ingredients are be placed in the pot at the beginning of the day, turned on, and it will all be ready by dinnertime. The rice cooker, on the other hand, has just two settings: cook and warm. So it cooks the meal then keeps it warm ‘til you’re ready to serve. Consider yourself informed.</p>

<p>This is ostensibly a book review, so let’s finally talk about the book, more about me later. Roger Ebert is a Pulitzer Prize winning author; he was the first film critic to win the Pulitzer and remained the only one for twenty-eight years. So, theoretically, I don’t have to tell you that he is a great writer. You wouldn’t expect a film critic to write a book about cooking, but he did and he brings the same natural and witty style of writing he uses in his film reviews. But even his cookbook is rife with film references, which made it all the more enjoyable for me, the film buff that I am.  Ebert writes of how the rice cooker can be used by people short on time, money and space to cook healthy and tasty meals. But he is quick to say that he’s not putting his readers on an all rice diet. In fact, he claims that practically anything can be cooked in the rice cooker. The book is a really quick read; I got through it in less than three hours tonight. Mom, for you and any other health nuts…uh…health conscious people, the book is a proponent of locally grown, organic food and names books and websites with information on finding community gardens, edible school yards, and farmers’ markets in your area. I noticed while writing this review, Ebert always refers to the Pot with the capital “P” as if it was a deity of some sort. That gives you an idea of the esteem he holds for this appliance.</p>

<p>When I first moved to Carlsbad, over a year and a half ago, I lived on microwaveable dinners. A few months ago, I finally got myself a Foreman Grill which has improved my daily cuisine some. And I anticipate the Pot improving this bachelor’s life as well. Thanks Roger…</p>

<p><b> Ebert: Now the Foreman Grill! Man!</b> </p>

Thanks for the response! I cannot overstate how much of an inspiration you've been for me. Your knowledge of film is enviable, to say the least...</p>

I've sent her the link to try to help her along with her cooking adventures.  <br />
I got my rice cooker at a thrift store.  It was practically brand new and cost 5$.  I'm still using it a few times a week after 4 years.</p>

                    <p>This is a somewhat dead thread, but here goes nothing.</p>

<p>Just made this for lunch:</p>

<p>2 cups of elbow macaroni<br />
1 cup of heavy cream<br />
1 cup of chicken broth<br />
1/2 cup of shredded cheese<br />
2 tablespoons of butter<br />
Salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, hot sauce to taste.</p>

<p>I threw everything into the pot (even the cheese), and it came out perfectly. All told, the ingredients to make 6-8 servings of this stuff cost around $5 and made me feel way more talented than if I'd just thrown a box of kraft on the stove. Might want to ramp up the cheese, if you try it, but I was pleasantly surprised by the end result.</p>

                    <p>Hmmm...this managed not to post the other day. Here's a recipe for macaroni and cheese, for the perusal of people from 2008. If I'm being incredibly impatient with your response to old threads, just ignore this one. My bad.</p>

<p>2 cups elbow macaroni<br />
1 cup heavy cream<br />
1 cup chicken broth<br />
1 cup of shredded cheese<br />
2 tablespoons butter<br />
salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, hot sauce to taste</p>

<p>Common sense dictates that you'd throw in the cheese once the Pot clicks over to Keep Warm, but I threw caution to the wind and tossed the cheese in with everything else. I used a cheap bag of mild cheddar, as I was worried about ruining a more expensive, better cheese, but now that I've done it a few times, I'm pretty sure that the finer cheeses will work and might produce some satisfactory results. Gouda? White cheddar? It will probably all work. For an extra punch, maybe steam some broccoli? Add some bacon?</p>

<p>And, to reiterate something I've tweeted to you a few times, an Ebertfest Rice Cooker Cook-Off would likely fill an auditorium. I know I'd skip a day of work to put my culinary skills to the test. Of course, I imagine Tilda Swinton would be judging, and that she'd love my macaroni and cheese, but this is a distant and unlikely dream.</p>

<p><b> Ebert: I like the idea of the bacon.</b> </p>
