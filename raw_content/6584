<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/silky-smooth-pumpkin-pie/" title="pumpkin pie, under attack"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3009/3011319606_2f4a66f91e.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="pumpkin pie, under attack" /></a></p>
Is pumpkin pie as we know it broken? This is what I was asking myself at 10 p.m. last night as I had words I will only express in asterisks going through my head as I was in my twentieth minute of trying to push a pumpkin pie filling through a very fine mesh strainer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3010468183/" title="my first canned yams, ever"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3026/3010468183_25921a6b02_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="my first canned yams, ever" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3011306240/" title="vegetable, dairy"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/3011306240_2b58bbc76a_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="vegetable, dairy" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3010489203/" title="cooking the filling"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3254/3010489203_3eb1ebf0d2_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="cooking the filling" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3010471555/" title="adding the dairy"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3162/3010471555_417e7075df_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="adding the dairy" /></a></p>
<p>The source of the recipe, as some of you may have guessed by now, was the November 2008 issue of Cook&#8217;s Illustrated, wherein seeking to make a more complex and less grainy pie, those clever people up in Vermont came to a few conclusions. Swapping out some pumpkin puree with canned yams resulted in a better pumpkin flavor, as did concentrating the flavor by cooking the filling on the stove top before filling the crust.  They also found that a mix of a higher and lower baking temperature kept the pie&#8217;s custard from curdling (making the filling a bit coarse). And then they found that passing the filling through a fine mesh strainer resulted in a less grainy filling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/3011311222/" title="straining the filling, and also my nerves"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3151/3011311222_b9dfb3460f.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="straining the filling" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-1188"></span></p>
<p>Which pretty much brings us up to 10 p.m. Now, I should have known better than to start a recipe that late (after the gym, after dinner and after a long work day) and I have no doubt whatsoever that this was in part what wore down my patience. Also? I hate passing things through strainers. I must have the &#8220;finest&#8221; strainer known to man, because I swear, a cup of flour can take five minutes to sift in that thing. It is enough to make you strain your own sanity and question that of the bow-tied man. (In the end, I switched to a medium-mesh strainer and might have saved myself a few gray hairs. I can only hope.)</p>

<p>But when I tried the pie today, all of my frustration and asterisked words dissipated. This is some <i>good pie</i>. It is silky and not so heavy, it is smooth and a bit velvety, it is softly spiced and very pumpkin-y and I don&#8217;t mean to tattle or anything, but Alex has already had two slices. Of pie that did not involve chocolate.</p>
<p>I rest my case.</p>

<p><b>Silky Smooth Pumpkin Pie</b><br />
Adapted from Cook&#8217;s Illustrated, November &#038; December 2008</p>
<p>A half-recipe of your favorite pie crust, chilled (Updated: My choice these days is my <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/pie-crust-102-all-butter-really-flaky-pie-dough/">All-Butter, Really Flaky Pie Dough</a>)</p>
<p>1 cup heavy cream<br />
1 cup whole milk (I used 2 cups of half and half instead of one cup each of cream and milk)<br />
3 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin puree<br />
1 cup drained candied yams from 15-ounce can (regular canned yams can be substituted)<br />
3/4 cup sugar<br />
1/4 cup maple syrup<br />
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger (I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground because I&#8217;m not a huge fan of fresh ginger)<br />
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br />
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br />
1 teaspoon table salt</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</p>
<p>Roll out dough on generously floured (up to 1/4 cup) work surface to make 12-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick.  Roll dough loosely around rolling pin and unroll into pie plate, leaving at least 1-inch overhang all around pie plate.</p>
<p>Working around circumference, ease dough into plate by gently lifting edge of dough with one hand while pressing into plate bottom with other hand. Refrigerate 15 minutes. Trim overhang to 1/2 inch beyond lip of pie plate. Fold overhang under itself; edge should be flush with edge of pie plate. Using thumb and forefinger, flute edge of dough. Refrigerate dough-lined plate until firm, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove pan from refrigerator, line crust with foil and fill with pie weights or pennies. Bake on rimmed baking sheet 15 minutes. Remove foil and weights, rotate plate. Bake 5 to 10 more minutes until crust is golden brown and crisp. Remove plate and baking sheet from oven.</p>
<p><u>Make the filling:</u> While pie shell is baking, whisk cream, milk, eggs, yolks and vanilla together in medium bowl. Combine pumpkin puree, yams, sugar, maple syrup, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in large heavy-bottomed saucepan; bring to sputtering simmer over medium heat, 5 to 7 minutes. Continue to simmer pumpkin mixture, stirring constantly and mashing yams against sides of pot, until thick and shiny, 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove pan from heat. Whisk in cream mixture slowly, until fully incorporated. Strain mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over medium bowl, using back of ladle or spatula to press solids through strainer. Re-whisk mixture and transfer to warm pre-baked pie shell. Return pie plate with baking sheet to oven and bake pie for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees. Continue baking until edges are set (instant-read thermometer inserted in center registers 175 degrees), 20 to 35 minutes longer. Transfer pie to wire rack and cool to room temperature, 2 to 3 hours. (The pie finishes cooking with resident heat; to ensure the filling sets, cool it at room temperature and not in the refrigerator.)</p>

				<p>Finally, someone else who shares a not-so-fondness for fresh ginger.  I thought it was taboo to admit as such in foodcentric circles.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be trying this for sure, because I need to produce a pie that 1) doesn&#8217;t get a &#8220;meh, might as well buy one&#8221; reaction; and b) doesn&#8217;t contain any frippery like espresso or cheesecake or other non-pumpkin-pie-ness.</p>

				<p>A friend made pumpkin pie cobbler the other day and my God, was it fabulous. I think it&#8217;s forever usurped pumpkin pie for me. I&#8217;m working frantically on a recipe to put on my site.</p>

				<p>What?  no ground cloves in the recipe?  I love that part!<br />
I like the idea of the yams and pumpkin.  I&#8217;ve never cared for sweet pot pie because it was too pasty and dense..this sounds like a perfect combo.  I also like the idea of the fresh milk or half&amp;half..canned milk has a off taste that comes through..at least I think it does.  I&#8217;ve never found my pumpkin pie lumpy or grainy..ever!  But..it&#8217;s never been silky either.  That&#8217;s what has me interested.  Thanks for checking this out for us, Deb.  I&#8217;ll give it a pre-TG trial.</p>

				<p>One of the other things the CI cooks were trying to adjust in their old pumpkin pie recipe was that they felt it was too heavily spiced, and that the cloves were a big part of this. I paused myself when I saw that there was only half a teaspoon of cinnamon but the pie is a delight. Delicately spiced and very pumpkin-y. Of course, you can always use these techniques and your own spice preferences, but I am glad I tried this new way out.</p>

				<p>I will have to give this a try.   Last year I made pumpkin and sweet potato pie.  Now I&#8217;d only have to make one!!  yeah!!  I&#8217;ve never had a grainy pumpkin pie.  I use the Libby recipe and it is always smooth or maybe I don&#8217;t know what smooth is?</p>

				<p>CI is freaking amazing. I use their pumpkin pie recipe from &#8220;The New Best Recipe,&#8221; which does not involve yams or mesh strainers, but does involve pureeing the filling in a food processor and cooking it on the stovetop. It really does make a difference!</p>

				<p>Thanks for providing their thoughts on their spice issue.  I&#8217;ll take your word for the spice adjustment.  After all, I&#8217;m doing a trial run and can adjust the spices for the big show if concensus dictates</p>

				<p>Deb,</p>
<p>I detest pumpkin pie :-(  In all honesty I have tried very hard to like it and tried all my friends&#8217; grandma&#8217;s and ma&#8217;s pumpkin pies and tried making my own.  Alas, I disliked each and every one of them.  In my 7 yrs in  the U.S. I have attended 7 Thanksgiving feasts and on each one of them I sadly watched everyone devour their slice of the pie while I mourned.  I thought to myself, &#8220;pumpkin and I can never ever be friends.&#8221; :-(<br />
Then everything changed last Christmas! A friend brought me a pumpkin bread and I LOVED it.  Then I decided that the next time I go to anyone&#8217;s Thanksgiving feast I will take along a pumpkin bread &#8211; for myself primarily.  Now Thanksgiving is near and I don&#8217;t have a recipe.  Since you are the queen of desserts, may I please request you for a recipe of PuB? I know that there are a lot of recipes out there but, your recipes are always a class apart.  So, if you have time, please post a recipe for PuB.</p>

				<p>This is exactly what I needed as I am in charge of pies for Thanksgiving.  Do you think Pie making is something that requires a dry run?  And thus me eating at least one entire pie prior to Thanksgiving.  I&#8217;m thinking yes.  More because I want pie then I am afraid of screwing it up.</p>

				<p>Deb, you have gotten me even more addicted to cooking than I already was with all your fabulous recipes and stunning photos. One of my old roommates used to bake his pumpkin pie with a thin layer of lightly sweetened cream cheese spread about 1/8&#8243; to 1/4&#8243; on the bottom and the pumpkin pie on top. I thought it was a little strange at first, but by golly, it was the most decadent pie I&#8217;ve ever tasted!</p>

				<p>Deb, I *just* (meaning yesterday!) searched your site for a good pumpkin pie recipe &amp; was super surprised to find there wasn&#8217;t one to be found &#8211; - until now &#8211; - this pie looks scrumptious!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve tried CI&#8217;s old pumpkin pie recipe, and yes &#8211; way too heavily spiced. I was not a fan.  I haven&#8217;t tried this one, but I&#8217;m glad to read your review.  I&#8217;ll be sure to use a medium-mesh strainer if I ever make it.</p>

				<p>For about 4 years in college   I had this &#8217;signature&#8217; pumpkin pie that I brought proudly to every autumn party I was invited to. It was horribly overspiced, grainy, too sweet and otherwise bad. I always wondered why there was so much leftovers. Haven&#8217;t attempted pumpkin pie since my realization that my pie sucked&#8230;. But I have a good strainer and I think I&#8217;ll give this a go. Thanks for the motivation.</p>

				<p>Will try this recipe for Thanksgiving.  I try a new pumpkin pie recipe every year. May I also comment on your chocolate chip cookies.  The chocolate discs were beautiful.  Have you ever tried milk chocolate in your cookies instead of bittersweet?  If not, it is a whole different animal, er cookie.</p>

				<p>If you are going to go to the trouble to sieve canned pumpkin why not just roast your own? For my going away Thanksgiving dinner (missed it in America from the transatlantic move) I roasted (no water, salt or oil) Buttercup &amp; Butternut squashes and then whirred the scraped squash in a food processor. No passing through any sieve needed. Smooth as silk and light, <a href="http://eggbeater.typepad.com/shuna/2005/11/pie_perfected.html" rel="nofollow">fresh pumpkin</a> scent.</p>

				<p>You can used fresh yams instead of canned &#8211; sweet potatoes is what we call them in Canada but I think the orange ones are actually yams&#8230;.  Poke and microwave until done.  Squash, like butternut, also makes a great pumpkin pie.</p>

<p>I am usually in the &#8216;more is better&#8217; spice camp (I often don&#8217;t measure spices and just sprinkle them on to my glory), but I will have to try a pie with less spice and see how I like it. Maybe less is more? :)</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m really enjoying NaBloPoMo over here &#8211; thanks!</p>
<p>My treasured Thanksgiving traditions include getting together with my sister the day before to make the pies.  We like to have one pie per guest, so while several guests bring dessert as well, we feel it incumbent upon us to put out, so to speak.</p>
<p>Whatever fun, new pie recipe we come up with, we always have to have the standards &#8211; Cook&#8217;s Illustrated Pumpkin and Pecan pies.  We use the Best Recipe or the Baking cookbook (they&#8217;re a little different in each), and curse as we dig out the candy thermometer for the pecan pie, and the Very Old Beans for the pie weights, but the results are always worth the efforts.  I haven&#8217;t strained the pumpkin before, but it does go through the food processor at some point.  We now have an immersion blender, which should make this part easier.</p>
<p>This year my family will be at my grandmothers, and my sister will stay home, so I will miss our late night Get Out the Pie session.</p>

				<p>Just after Halloween is a great time to get pumpkins cheaply.  Look for small but &#8220;heavy for its size&#8221; ones. Canned pumpkin is bland in comparison. </p>
<p>Cut your pumpkin into long strips as you would a cantaloupe, then use your serrated knife to remove seeds and strings. Cook pumpkin (Check net for the many ways)  I use a pressure cooker and cook for 12 minutes at 15lbs. </p>
<p>Put into a strainer and when cool remove the shell.  You can freeze the pumpkin in zip bags and use in many recipes. Pumpkin soup rocks!</p>
<p>Use 3 cups pumpkin for a deep dish pie. 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp ground cloves, 1 tsp ground allspice, and 1/2 tsp ground ginger, and 1/2 tsp salt. 18 oz canned evaporated milk, 4 eggs. Beat on med high till smooth.  If some small fibers collects on your beaters discard the fibers. Pout into your pie shell and bake at 425 for 20 minutes then reduce heat to 350 for 45 minutes or until a knife comes out clean. </p>
<p>If you have leftover pumpkin mix just bake it in an oven proof buttered bowl.</p>
<p>No, your pie won&#8217;t be silky smooth but this is a pie guys like me really love.</p>

				<p>This sounds utterly fabulous, and my pumpkin-pie-loving associates agree. However I *know* I will skip the step that involves straining the filling and get a less silky texture as a result. You know what? I don&#8217;t care! I&#8217;m not sure it would seem like a proper pumpkin pie without a slight graininess. Of course, my fellow cook might disagree.</p>

				<p>Yumminess. Pumpkin pie is probably my favorite part of Thanksgiving. After mashed potatoes and gravy. I, too, am one of the Spice Queens. I always add a tiny bit of cloves (and mace, which takes it up a notch). For some reason it&#8217;s not the same without the spices for me&#8211; it&#8217;s like that combination of spices is the taste of pumpkin pie. Instead of canned milk/any other kind of milk, I always use egg nog, too. I don&#8217;t think I could handle a lightly spiced pie, but the cooking and yams could be the ticket. I think I&#8217;ll try the cooking part, too (but no strainer as I don&#8217;t have the patience, maybe the food processor will help?).</p>

				<p>*sheepish*  </p>
<p>What our family does for pumpkin pie is use a pie crust recipe from Fanny Farmer and then make the filling according to the directions on Libby&#8217;s Pumpkin Puree.  We&#8217;ve never needed anything else, it tastes delicious and is very easy!  :-)  Your version sounds time consuming and hard!  We serve a pumpkin pie every Thanksgiving and Christmas and at any excuse between those times.</p>

				<p>@ Tabitha &#8211; Most cookware stores carry pie weights; otherwise you can use any kind of dried beans or even rice.  I myself would hesitate to use pennies because they seem so dirty (yes I know they don&#8217;t touch the pie).<br />
 @Nancy &#8211; They are all sweet potatoes.  Real yams are pale and starchy and don&#8217;t grow in the New World.  The orange ones began to be called &#8220;yams&#8221; as a marketing tool.<br />
I&#8217;m so glad it&#8217;s fall &#8211; I love pumpkins and winter squashes and sweet potatoes!</p>

				<p>My family loves pumpkin pie. We prefer the pie I make because it doesn&#8217;t have any spices except cinnamon. (The kids can&#8217;t stand the typical pumpkin pie spices like ginger, cloves, and nutmeg.) I always make my own crust. When I have time, my family prefers I make the filling from scratch too &#8211; not from a can. It&#8217;s a lot of extra work to cut, cook, and mash the pumpkin, but it tastes so much better.  It&#8217;s kind of like the difference between instant mashed potatoes and real mashed potatoes. </p>
<p>Well, I tried something new last month. Instead of regular pumpkin pie, I made a pumpkin ice cream pie. Turned out pretty good if you ask me. You can try it if you like: <a href="http://www.ice-cream-freaks.com/ice-cream-pie-pumpkin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ice-cream-freaks.com/ice-cream-pie-pumpkin.html</a></p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve just been told that my incredibly picky brother-in-law (who I love) gets really sad when there&#8217;s no traditional, plain-old pumpkin pie on the table at thanksgiving. Since they&#8217;re coming here, I&#8217;m SO glad you posted this recipe! This is the pie I will make. Thank you!</p>
<p>(and, it seems, I&#8217;ve just recently come out from under my rock to find your amazing blog. I&#8217;ve made a number of your recipes in the past few weeks and they&#8217;ve all been completely fabulous! Thank you, again!)</p>

				<p>Why do you want it silky smooth ?</p>
<p>A good pumpkin (or sweet potatoe) pie should have a firm, fibrous texture.  It&#8217;s pie, not babyfood.</p>

				<p>People divide into two equally sound preferences. Some like the firm bodied fibrous texture and others prefer their custards to be silky smooth. I am definitely in the silky category myself and I have great success achieving that with pumpkin or sweet potato pie by pureeing in a food processor for a couple of minutes instead of straining.</p>

				<p>&#8230;I have this thing where I try not to eat anything with pumpking in it until the pumpkin pie at TG.  I know..it sounds silly, but I need to build up anticipation for pumpkin pie, or nobody will eat any of it on the big day.  I think it started when we got sick of it after having it in so many treats before the holiday..and then everyone wasn&#8217;t interested in pumpkin anything by TG.  So..to test this, I&#8217;ll just give everyone a bite..and send the rest away.</p>

				<p>My pumpkin pie solution? Let my mom make it. Such a cop out but definitely the preference. And I have the finest strainer known to man as well. Once I had to sift the seeds out of a raspberry puree, and after awhile I couldn&#8217;t tell if the red color was the fruit or the blood from my wrists.</p>

				<p>Deb &#8211; I abandoned the pumpkin pie years ago.  it never lived up to my ambitions.  They just never turned out that great.  I will try the CI&#8217;s version this year.  You have given me hope.</p>
<p>P.S. How do you put your pictures in that cute 2&#215;2 square arrangement?</p>

				<p>Our family loves pumpkin pie too and this no-clove recipe looks fabulous!  We NEVER use actual pumpkin for pie in our family.  We like to use the big, ugly, gray-green Hubbard squash my dad grows.  They are so big and tough that my husband uses an ax to cut it up.  Then, I put the chunks, skin and all, in a 9&#215;13 pan with a little water, cover with plastic wrap and microwave until tender.  Process it in a food processor and you&#8217;ve got the most delightful &#8220;pumpkin&#8221; for pie ever.  And, our favorite pie has no cloves either!  Hooray for lightly spiced, custardy, velvety smooth &#8220;Pumpkin&#8221; pie!</p>

				<p>Hey Deb, I just emailed this to my mom, who is a pumpkin pie fanatic.  She&#8217;s a totally lazy baker so there is no way she would ever take it on, but I told her to make Ross do it for Thanksgiving.  He loves labor-intensive recipes.  As long as he gets to make a huge mess and have Dad clean up after him.</p>

				<p>Have to 2nd Shuna (#26). My friend finds that butternut squash makes things more pumpkiny and smoother and it&#8217;s easy to roast your own. For me it&#8217;s the best pumpkin pie I&#8217;ve ever had and I didn&#8217;t have to make it. Best of both worlds.</p>

				<p>Pie accomplished! I followed your recipe exactly &#8212; from the half and half to the 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground ginger. I was leery that the pie didn&#8217;t include cloves (and glad to hear that you were too!), but it IS spicy nonetheless. I attribute it to the cooking down of the pumpkin/yam/spice mixture. It&#8217;s smooth, thick, tall, and spicy. LOVE it. It&#8217;s now my go to pumpkin pie recipe. I used pennies as pie weights, and my own apple cider vinegar pie crust recipe. Delish! </p>
<p>PS &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t sure if my deep dish Emily Henry pie plate would be a good fit for the pie (the dish in the photos doesn&#8217;t look very deep), and baked with it anyway at my husband&#8217;s suggestion, it was a PERFECT fit. In fact, the pie would have runneth over had I used a shallower dish.</p>

				<p>OK, while I am sure this pie is fabulous, I must say that the thought of the canned pumpkin does make me wince. I never cared much for pumpkin pie and my hubby loves the stuff. Thus, two years ago, I decided to make one from scratch&#8211;not with the dreaded canned pumpkin stuff but by using a real (roasted) sugar pie pumpkin. All the while, dear hubby was giving me a hard time by saying that he&#8217;d &#8220;never be able to tell the difference&#8221; and &#8220;why was I going to such trouble?&#8221; I am proud to say that my husband swore he&#8217;d never eat a &#8220;regular&#8221; pumpkin pie again once he had the &#8220;real&#8221; deal and now anxiously awaits Thanksgiving to enjoy pumpkin pie. And happily I admit that now I, too, find it quite lovely.</p>

				<p>Bianca, it doesn&#8217;t call for Canned Pumpkin Pie FILLING, just canned pumpkin puree.  Totally different.  (The filling has &#8220;stuff&#8221; in it.  The puree is just pumpkin.)</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t find it, you can just buy a small-ish pumpkin, quarter it, scrap the seeds and roast it in the oven.  When it&#8217;s done, scrap out the &#8220;guts&#8221; and toss them in a food processor/blender.</p>

				<p>The &#8220;straining&#8221; sounds like it could be accomplished more easily by using a food mill. Not an item found in every kitchen, and I don&#8217;t suggest you go buy one unless you&#8217;re planning on making a lot of baby food or applesauce. It takes up a lot of space. I inherited one from my grandmother who made wicked good applesauce.</p>

				<p>My trick to the best pumpkin pie is real pumpkin.  Whenever I tell people that they look horrified and ask how I have the patience&#8230;.it really only takes an additional 10-15 minutes of actual hands-on time, and the difference is huge.  The flavour is more mellow and smooth. I also use some sweetened condensed milk in the filling.  This was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving (Canadian Thanksgiving was at the beginning of October) meal this year.</p>

				<p>This looks like it might be good, but I definitely prefer my pumpkin pie to have texture rather than be too smooth.  Though, pureed-to-death pumpkin works great for pumpkin custard or pudding.  I usually use a recipe from my grandmother&#8217;s 1930&#8217;s cookbook to make my pumpkin pies.  I go way lighter on the ginger, though, since it can overwhelm the other spices &#8211; especially the organic stuff I got at Whole Foods.  Oh, and pumpkin cooks up easily in the microwave. Just cut it up and nuke it, then scrape out the &#8216;meat&#8217; of it. I mash it with a potato masher :-) I usually buy a pumpkin or two in the fall and then can some of it to use later in the year when you can&#8217;t buy fresh ones.</p>

				<p>I hate to say it, but in my opinion this isn&#8217;t &#8220;hours better&#8221; than other pumpkin pie.  I tried it last night, and true, it made a delightful breakfast this morning, but I&#8217;ve got to say that it seems like fixing something that wasn&#8217;t really broken.  Or maybe my discriminating tastes (hah) just don&#8217;t extend to pumpkin pie.  As long as the crust is good, that is.<br />
On the other hand, as one who takes the more-must-be-better approach to spicing things, I thought the spicing here was really good (I also did pwdered ginger) &#8212; I didn&#8217;t even miss my beloved cloves.</p>

				<p>Is there a typo in the final part of the baking instructions? I&#8217;m making this right now and it&#8217;s been in the oven at 300 degrees for almost 50 minutes &#8211; still fairly loose in center and only at 150 on instant-read. I&#8217;m just going to pull it soon as I need to get to sleep! But just wondering if anyone else had this problem. Next time I&#8217;ll do the second temp at 350.</p>

				<p>i just made this pie tonight&#8230; my first solo pie attempt. a few things&#8230;<br />
1. mesh strainer= second level of hell, i had to send my boyfriend out half way through to get me a bigger/less fine version.<br />
2. i left the pie in for almost an hour too and the middle was still pretty loose whenever i moved it to check ( i don&#8217;t yet have a thermometer). finally i cranked up the heat to 400 for the last seven minutes. there were a few crispy corners of the crust but better safe than sorry.<br />
*i&#8217;ll let you know tomorrow how it turns out.</p>

				<p>I made this pie yesterday.  You were right; this is some good pie!  I made one slight change and that was to add 1/8 tsp of cloves and reduce the nutmeg to 1/8 tsp as well; the flavor was perfect for me.  I did taste pumpkin predominately with hints of spice.  The texture was soft and smooth as silk and creamy light.  My husband was admonishing me for undercooking the pie as he was stuffing his 2nd perfectly set wedge in his &#8216;pie hole.&#8217;  He just didn&#8217;t get the concept, but he will as I intend to make this pie again.</p>
<p> I am glad that the internal temp reading was provided, or I&#8217;d have left that pie in the oven longer.  As #70 Trisha Lynn noted, it took mine almost an hour to come to temp, but I figured that was because I used a deep dish pie plate and baked it on a cookie sheet.   I didn&#8217;t have stainer problems (mine is a med mesh) but I used my flat masher to break up the sweet potatoes when I first put them in the pan.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the pie recipe!  This was my first ever pumpkin pie and I found it wasn&#8217;t too hard to make at all.  I used my food mill (hand crank food grinder (i.e. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1469166265/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/teenytinyturkey/1469166265/</a> )- usually used to make baby food) instead of a strainer and that step was done in 30 seconds flat!</p>

				<p>Response to #70 and #71 &#8211; I did my pie according the to instructions, and yes, the middle was totally not set by the end.  I had the pie in for half an hour and then took it out and let it cool, and only 2-3 inches away from the crust had actually set.  I&#8217;m making this again tomorrow for Thanksgiving, and I&#8217;ll definitely be leaving it in for longer! (50 minutes maybe?)  Thanks for the help.</p>

				<p>Made the pie this morning and pulled it out of the oven after 45 minutes (against my better judgment, because my thermometer hadn&#8217;t reached 175 degrees) and ended up with a pie that didn&#8217;t set completely.</p>
<p>Aesthetics aside, the texture was utterly amazing as was the balance of spices and sweetness! Now a little wiser, I will definitely make it again and adjust the time accordingly.</p>

				<p>I made this pie for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I wasn&#8217;t too sure about the maple syrup flavor at first, but after a few bites, I was convinced. It was definitely worth the time and effort. Also, I used your all-butter pie crust recipe and instructions and it turned out perfectly! I&#8217;ve never been good at making pie crust and had previously resorted to using the store-bought kind (blech!), but I&#8217;ll never do that again.</p>
<p>Thanks for the great information and inspiration to create some wonderful food for my family this year!!</p>

				<p>I made this as a test run for Thanksgiving, and my roommate and I adored it. I used Dorie&#8217;s pie crust and didn&#8217;t have trouble straining the filling through my medium mesh strainer. I too should have left it in the oven for longer (took it out after about 40 minutes), as it didn&#8217;t set up as firmly as I would have liked. I think my pie dish was also shallower than is normal, because I ended up only using about half of the filling! But it&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m planning on baking up the leftover filling as a crustless custard-type thing to devour later with less guilt. :) We ate almost the whole pie by ourselves over the course of a week, and, sadly, I didn&#8217;t have time to make one for my family when T-Day came around! :( Thanks for the super recipe. This one&#8217;s a keeper.</p>

				<p>Loved your recipe.  Never considered using maple syrup.  I think I&#8217;ll give this recipe a try at Christmas.  I think we will do a taste test between yours with maple syrup and mine using your recipe with fresh pumpkin.  I find that it has a unique taste when using fresh rather than processed pumpkin.</p>

				<p>First post from long-time lurker&#8211;the pie was wonderful!!  I&#8217;ve never liked pumpkin pie nor has my 85-yr. old mother, but decided to make this for our huge Thanksgiving gathering (45 people).  I flew from CA into S.C. where my family now lives and my aunt, who sells her cakes and pies, my mother, and I all couldn&#8217;t believe how yummy this pie was. There was some extra filling so we each had a taste from a small ramekin full and loved it.  Well, my pie was on the dessert table along with 3 other pumpkin pies and several other pies, cakes, brownies, etc.  My pie was the only pumpkin pie totally demolished.  I never got a taste, so I made another one a few days ago and my mother and I enjoyed it immensely. </p>
<p>I’ve almost posted a couple of times, but this pie finally drew me out. If the pumpkin-pie haters would give this a taste, I think they’d change their minds. I think the reason I have always disliked it is because it’s usually so heavily spiced. This one is definitely a winner!! </p>
<p>Thanks for all your recipes&#8211;I&#8217;ve tried several now and there&#8217;s only one that needed some tweaking IMHO.  I also enjoy your humor, pics, and info about NY since I grew up on LI and moved to CA when I was 30 (23 years ago).  Keep up the great work!</p>

				<p>BTW, I also had to cook the pies for 50 min. @ 300 degrees after the 10 min. @ 400.  I used an instant-read thermometer (purchased especially for this pie) and kept checking, but now I&#8217;m comfortable leaving it in for the extra time w/o constantly peeking.</p>

				<p>Delicious pie!  Mine took 45 min at 300.  Straining wasn&#8217;t so bad because I used the hand mixer first.  I like the addition of the yams.  Thanks for another winner!</p>

				<p>has anyone had the eggs curdle on them when adding hot pumpkin to milk and egg mixture?</p>
<p>going to make this today and the thought crossed my mind&#8230; I have made a lot of flour-less chocolate cakes&#8230; or rather I have messed up a few of them.</p>

				<p>Hi pinktea &#8212; If you drizzle the cream mixture in slowly, you can safely avoid any curdling as that will temper it. (It probably won&#8217;t curdle even if hot because there is so much more milk/cream than eggs, but I always like to play it extra-safe.) I will update the recipe to suggest this, thanks. Good luck!</p>

				<p>This came out really well- extremely smooth and perfectly spiced.  The recommendation to use a food mill instead of a strainer was right on.  It makes a lot of filling- use a deep dish and make sure your pie crust doesn&#8217;t shrink down or it won&#8217;t all fit.  For the commenters who were not convinced and are still looking for the ultimate fall holiday pie, maybe you would like the Lee Bros. Southern Cookbook sweet potato pie.  It has lemon juice and buttermilk, which gives it a really bright, slightly tangy taste.  If I could only make one squash/yam/pumpkin dessert (and thankfully it has not come to that), it would be their pie.  The recipe is posted in many places, including here: <a href="http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/cookbook/2007/lee-southern/sweet-potato-pie.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/cookbook/2007/lee-southern/sweet-potato-pie.html</a></p>

				<p>This is similar to Rose Levy Berenbaum&#8217;s recipe out of the Pie and Pastry bible, in that you cook the filling, which gives it an amazing texture.<br />
My husband&#8217;s family thinks I&#8217;m a little nuts when I go to such efforts to make the perfect pie, but they all enjoy the results (even the ones who say they aren&#8217;t big pumpkin pie fans usually go back for seconds!)<br />
BTW, Rose advocates using the canned pumpkin for reliability, and doesn&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much difference between &#8220;fresh&#8221; and canned; maybe I&#8217;ll have to do a side-by-side comparison&#8230;mmmmm</p>

				<p>My mother in law makes her pumpkin pie with carrots instead of pumpkin.  It&#8217;s hard to admit but it&#8217;s as good as my pumpkin pie I make with sugar pumpkins.  Plus, it&#8217;s easier to find carrots and cooked carrots are easy to blend, no straining.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking for a new pumpkin/carrot pie recipe and I&#8217;m intrigued by yours, I like the idea of adding maple syrup.  We have Thanksgiving in a few weeks so I&#8217;m testing out recipes.</p>

				<p>Any time I need a recipe I come straight here &#8211; I love it &#8211; and I just tried this recipe last night but I am not sure I did it right&#8230; </p>
<p>Everything turned out beautifully (even the sieving) but the final product was a little eggy for some reason.  Has anyone else had this problem?  It was still completely and totally awesome right down to my very first pie crust, but I&#8217;m worried I didn&#8217;t cook it long enough maybe? Maybe I just like my pie less like an egg custard.  Do you think it would it mess too much with the texture if I left out some of the egg?</p>

				<p>Made this for my first Canadian Thanksgiving! It was my first attempt at making pumpkin pie and it turned out beautifully! Couldn&#8217;t find canned/candied yams here in Quebec so just doubled the pumpkin filling. The pastry worked beautifully, I was glad of the tip to stop at the &#8220;size of peas&#8221; otherwise I would have kept going. The new boyfriend, a massive pumpkin pie fan, loved it :)</p>
<p>Thanks for the great recipe!</p>

				<p>This was an all day effort, starting at 7am for me (a busy mom to a 2 and a 5 year old) with a pumpkin from our garden and fresh eggs from the farm nearby.  It&#8217;s probably the most perfect pumpkin pie EVER!  I can say that after I underbaked both the crust and the pie itself AND didnt push it through a sieve AND skipped the yams and used all pumpkin instead.  The flavor is amazing!  We&#8217;ll be making this again for Thanksgiving.  As always, thanks!</p>

				<p>Remarkable recipe. I took your light spice suggestion and I agree with your conservative approach. But for the ginger, I liked the bright flavor of freshly grated Hawaiian ginger. </p>
<p>On top of the work involved with this recipe, using roasted pumpkins and yams amounted to more work than I expected. And next time I&#8217;ll probably go withe a premade dough. At the time the homemade touches seemed like the right idea. Regardless of the time it took to make four pies&#8211;5 hours&#8211;the resulting texture and flavor made for a memorable desert. </p>
<p>All of the chunks from the pumpkins and yams did&#8217;t make it through the fine strainer. What didn&#8217;t make into the smooth pie found it&#8217;s way into another thick version. The thicker filling was just as good!</p>
<p>Is a silky-smooth consistency better? </p>
<p>Well done and thanks for your compassion with this sentimental dessert.</p>

				<p>I made this last night as a test run for Thanksgiving, and it was Perfect! Very pronounced pumpkin flavor, and I love the fact that there are no strongly-flavored cloves taking over the dish. The texture is so light and smooth; this is now my go-to recipe for pumpkin pie, hands-down.</p>
<p>As many commenters have noted, I, too, had to cook it much longer than the listed 20-35 minutes&#8211;probably closer to an hour. Also, as many have said, using a medium mesh strainer, I had no problems whatsoever, and the straining step went very quickly.</p>
<p>Good luck everyone, and enjoy!</p>

				<p>Last year I made an Apple Butter Pumpkin Pie, and while I loved the apple butter flavor, I wasn&#8217;t completely satisfied with the pie overall (it was good, but nothing extraordinary). I tried this recipe and I loved it, and now I&#8217;m wondering about incorporating some apple butter. Anyone have a suggestion as to how much of the pumpkin and candied yam I should have substituted?</p>
<p>The other recipe called for one cup each of apple butter and pumpkin. With this recipe, there are about three cups of fruit so my instinct is to go with just under one cup each of pumpkin, candied yams and apple butter. Or should apple butter make up half the fruit and then let pumpkin and yam make up the other half in combination?</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a matter of taste, I&#8217;ll go ahead and experiment&#8230; but I know baking needs to be exact, and I want to be sure to avoid a disaster! Any tips are welcome. Thanks!</p>

				<p>If you par-bake the crust, you shouldn&#8217;t have any issues of dampness. But even if you don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s not an overwhelmingly wet pie; you&#8217;ll probably be okay.</p>

				<p>Deb, I love your blog! This is my first time commenting, b/c I just have to say that I&#8217;m already making this pie for the 3rd time in a few weeks (2nd time in two days!). Everyone who&#8217;s tried it RAVES about it, and I may have even converted a few non-pumpkin pie eaters. Love the subtle flavor and the amazing silky texture which reminds me of Chinese egg custards. I did have to bake it almost 20 minutes longer than the recipe stated and ended up with too much filling. I might just buy those little pre-made tart shells and fill them with the leftover!</p>

				<p>i don&#8217;t know what happened but this did not work out! i made two different pie recipes this year (sour cream pumpkin pie from gourmet, which turned out great), and this one which worked only because i improvised when it became clear it would be disastrous! not sure where i went wrong, positive i got the measurements right, but when i started to add the cream mix into the warm pumpkin at a certain point it seemed the filling was the correct consistency but i still had about half of the cream mixture left to add. i should have stopped and trusted my instincts, but instead i thought, maybe that&#8217;s why everyone loves this pie, it&#8217;s some strange really-liquidy-filling that somehow works in the end. so i poured it all in, and it was pumpkin soup, but like, a really watery pumpkin soup. i tasted it and the flavor was delicious, but there was no way that was going to become a solid pumpkin filling, and definitely no way it would need to go through a strainer?! so i opened another can of pumpkin, used the rest of the sweet potato, added more spices and some of the liquid from the first attempt. all in all it ended up being fairly good, but the gourmet recipe was by far the favorite. where did i go wrong? the crust was also leaking butter in a way that has never happened with the recipe i usually use for pies (i had to keep opening the oven and wiping butter drips)! the only thing i did that maybe differed from the recipes was instead of using candied yams (couldn&#8217;t find any) i used pureed canned sweet potato. could that be the problem?</p>

				<p>no, no. thanks for the response + sorry if unclear. i made the filling as directed and it looked sooooo liquidy when i was done adding the cream to the pumpkin (even before being poured into the pie crust + baked) that i only used a little of the recipe filling and added to that another can of pumpkin and more spices (leaving me w. a ball jar of pumkin &#8220;milk&#8221; in the fridge). what was the consistency of your filling before baking? i assumed that because you included the step using the strainer it must have been fairly thick; if i had put mine through a strainer, it would have poured right through, almost like milk. though, i did eat the pie leftover today (my changed version) and it was alot better leftover than on thanksgiving, esp. the crust. still, i know something went wrong but i cannot for the life of me figure out what it was, as i am certain my measurements were exact. the only thing i could think was the canned pureed sweet potato instead of candied yams?!</p>

				<p>Hi Sasha &#8212; No, not very thick. The straining is really to remove any remaining pumpkin/yam strands or bits, to ensure the pie is &#8220;silky&#8221;. Sorry it did not work out for your meal!</p>

				<p>I made this for T-day last week and it was the most delicious pumpkin pie I ever tasted. It did seem very liquid-y and needed to stay in the oven longer than I thought it should, but it came out great. I also modified slightly by adding hazelnuts (with melted butter and brown sugar) on top and placing it under the broiler for a minute right before serving. Yum!</p>

				<p>My sister and my cousin and I made this for Thanksgiving this year. It was the best pumpkin pie I&#8217;ve ever made. We had a grand experiment too. We tried 3 different pie crusts, 2 pumpkin pie fillings, 2 kinds of apple pies, and we made a tart combining two of the recipes on your site: whole lemon tart filling w/ gingersnap crust (from the dark chocolate tart). It was to die for!</p>

				<p>I agree with Laurie, it did need to be in the oven a bit longer, but the outcome was OUTSTANDING. </p>
<p>Truth be told, before this I have never made a &#8220;from scratch&#8221; pumpkin pie. I&#8217;m so happy I trusted the reviews of this and tried it out.</p>

				<p>I have yet to find a single pumpkin pie recipe that does not call for &#8216;a 15 oz can of pumpkin pie filling.&#8217; I have recently moved to a country which does not see fit to import this product. I&#8217;ve been too scared to try to recreate it. What would you recommend? Just steam and mash? Start with 15 ounces of fresh pumpkin?</p>

				<p>Natasha- you can buy canned pumpkin many places. I usually get mine from my local super market. If you choose to get organic pumpkin, you could try finding it at specialty stores, or health food markets.<br />
Hope that helps!</p>
<p>The recipe looks good to.</p>

				<p>I can&#8217;t stand that these pies (THREE) are sitting around setting, only to be eaten tomorrow evening! darn&#8230; and in other not so fortunate news, as i was rolling out my dough, the oven decided it would not heat. ran to neighbors to ask for the use of their oven, just as they were leaving for the cottage (canadian thanksgiving (thank goodness for long weekends)). oh boy! i can not say it was easy, but these pies are looking and smelling so tasty!<br />
oh and i doubled the recipe, and yet am still left with quite a lot of filling&#8230; can&#8217;t say i&#8217;m complaining.</p>

				<p>I made a double batch of this recipe and, unfortunately, had trouble with the filling not setting by the 30 minute mark. The outer edge of the crusts are burned but the pies themselves are so delicious and smooth. I only had half the maple syrup required and I thought the maple flavoring was perfect. I ended up baking at a higher temp for 30 minutes for the second pie and it looks much better this time. Next time I might try not par-baking the crust.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,  I can&#8217;t wait to try this recipe.  Was wondering if there is an alternative if I don&#8217;t have pie weights or pennies.  I&#8217;ve heard dried beans?  But I actually use my dried beans for cooking.  Will they be effected by baking? Thanks!</p>

				<p>Nirmala &#8212; You can use dry beans but they will take muuuuch longer to cook and may not get as soft when you are done. You could also try weighting it with another pie dish, if it&#8217;s lightweight, maybe something else ovenproof to hold it down. Or, you could skip the prebaking step entirely. The crust won&#8217;t be as crisp but this is not a deal breaker for everyone. (It hardly bothers me, personally, on pumpkin pies.)</p>

				<p>We liked this pie and I&#8217;m planning to make it again for Thanksgiving this year! I followed the recipe as written, but minus the straining and with slight adjustments to the bake temp/time. Instead, I blended the filling after having mixed in all the cream/egg mixture. It came out beautifully silky and smooth when baked. Next time I will ratchet back the sugar a bit &#8211; perhaps to 1/2 cup sugar rather than 3/4 cup. Maybe my candied yams were more candied than some? I made do with another pie pan to weight down the pie crust during pre-baking&#8230;but the bottom still puffed/bubbled up. Am going to ask for pie weights for the holidays now. :) For bake time I did the 10 minutes at 400, about 30 minutes at 350, and then a little longer at 300.</p>

				<p>I have this pie cooling on the counter right now&#8230;my kitchen looks like a pumpkin exploded! I tripped on the kitchen rug when I was putting the filling into the crust, and pumpkin pie filling went everywhere, including down the sides of the crust and in between the oven and the cabinet (gotta love that). </p>
<p>I have a few quick questions: I had quite a bit of leftover pie filling &#8211; is this because I didn&#8217;t use a deep-dish pie pan? I used a regular Pyrex pie pan. I poured the leftovers into a little ramekin and baked it next to the pie on the baking sheet &#8211; when I tasted it, the filling in the ramekin was curdled. I hope that doesn&#8217;t mean the pie is curdled as well &#8211; I took it out right when it was about 175 degrees in the center, maybe a few degrees over, but very very close.</p>
<p>My second question is regarding the crust &#8211; after I prebaked it for the allotted time, it was really gooey and buttery looking &#8211; not at all crisp. I ended up baking it for a few more minutes on its own (no baking sheet), and it seemed to turn out okay, but is the crust supposed to look so wet and buttery and bubbling when it&#8217;s first baking? </p>
<p>Thanks for such great recipes and tutorials!</p>

				<p>I made this pie last night and it turned out fabulously!!! I did something a little different: I food processed the pumpkin and sweet potato (my store didn&#8217;t have &#8220;yams&#8221;) before cooking them. It seemed to make the texture a perfectly smooth consistency; almost like a mousse! </p>
<p>I did have to cook my pie a lot longer, and ended up turning up the oven&#8217;s temp to around 350º. It eventually reached an internal temp. of about 170º. I stopped at that point and called it a day.</p>
<p>It was delicious, and I&#8217;m definitely making it for Thanksgiving!</p>

				<p>I have a challenge for you that I really hope you&#8217;ll take on. My mother spent time on the farm of a family friend and the wife was apparently a fantastic cook. Only sad thing is all her recipes have vanished. The one my mom still thinks about today is a layer pumpkin-custard pie with the custard on the bottom. I have looked everywhere for this recipe and cannot find it. I am definitely not ready to just create my own recipe, so if you figured this one out I would adore you. Okay, I already do but still&#8230;</p>

				<p>Mel &#8211; I made this pie last year for Thanksgiving. I made and parbaked the crust, then packed that up, along with the filling in a tupperware container, to take to my in-laws&#8217; house. Once there, I filled the crust and baked it. Everything turned out great! Just refridgerate the filling because of the eggs.<br />

				<p>Chiming in that mine took an hour to be cooked through at 300 degrees, but was none the worse for the extra time. Oh, and USE A MEDIUM MESH STRAINER. I wanted to pitch the entire filling at several points because I don&#8217;t have one. It was dangerous and I may or may not have taken a nap afterward. But the pie is superb.</p>

				<p>My pie plate was a little too shallow, so I didn&#8217;t end up using all of the filling.  And I&#8217;m glad others said they had to cook the pie longer &#8211; I&#8217;m at a little over an hour and the internal temp is just approaching 170 &#8211; plus I bumped the temp up to 325 after checking at 50 minutes.  Crossing my fingers it tastes good&#8230; too bad it&#8217;s not de rigueur to bring a pie to a family function with a piece missing&#8230; :D</p>

				<p>Just made the pie and I&#8217;m super nervous about it turning out.  I read all the comments too late about the pie possibly needing to cook for an hour.  I baked mine for 40-45 minutes, till my thermometer died, made sure the edges were set and took it out.  Praying that all my hard work is rewarded.  Deb, you are my go-to-girl for amazing recipes.  I especially love to use your recipes to make an old standard absolutely amazing (like brown butter salted rice crispy treats!).  Anyway, I haven&#8217;t baked for the holidays in a few years, and missed it.  I also wondered why I had stopped, but was reminded why when my 3 and 7 year old went completely crazy today while mommy was busy in the kitchen.  I&#8217;ll be complementing the pros and cons while enjoying your pumpkin pie tomorrow :O)  Thanks!</p>

When I read &#8220;Bake on rimmed baking sheet&#8221;, I wondered, why a rimmed one?  I don&#8217;t own a rimmed one, so I used the rimless one I have.  Glad to say that the pie crust and I survived, but I now know why a rimmed sheet is best :O)</p>

				<p>Hey Deb &#8211; this is try #2 for this recipe for me.  I made it when you first published it 2 years ago, which became the family joke &#8211; &#8220;Would you like pumpkin pudding?&#8221; it was sooo super runny.  I&#8217;m going to try to cook it longer this year with the hopes that it solidifies.  However, even with a deep dish pie shell, I ended up with 3 cups extra filling!  Clearly I need to reduce this recipe for next time, but I&#8217;m not sure how to do it.  What would you recommend?  The cream? Or maybe halve it all around?  Thanks!</p>

				<p>This is the first Smitten Kitchen recipe I have made that I have been unsatisfied with the results. I felt the texture in the middle was still too soft and almost flan-like. I didn&#8217;t think the flavor was that great either. And the crust, although it rolled out like a dream puffed up and shrank like crazy, losing all the crimps. I don&#8217;t understand that during the par-baking they have you take out the weights/foil but then it puffed up and looked like a crazy tortilla shell. I tried again with the crust and the second one, even though I had folded it gently under the rim and crimped it, still un crimped and melted down from the rim! What did I do wrong?</p>
<p>p.s The bourbon pumpkin cheesecake was AMAZINGGGGG!</p>

				<p>Deb &#8211; PLEASE HELP.  First, I should say that the filling is lovely, creamy, thicker than most and so smooth.  </p>
<p>My problem is with par-baking the crust.  </p>
<p>I made your All Butter, Flaky Crust pie dough recipe two days before Thanksgiving.  Making the dough and rolling was a breeze.  I followed the instructions for par-baking, first baking it with weights for the required time and then took weights out as instructed for the additional 5-10 minutes with just the crust.  This is when things went south.  My crust puffed up to beautiful dome-like, convex shape &#8211; reminded me of the old fashioned stove top Jiffy Pop. There was no way this crust could be saved since no filling could be put into it!  Tried it with the second crust of the same batch with same results.</p>
<p>I thought it was my butter since I used a special local butter w high fat content, so I swapped it our with generic Land O Lakes for the second batch.  Same thing happened with crust #1.  So, I improvised with the second and last crust (it&#8217;s now day before Thanksgiving and still no pie crust!) by just par-baking it with weights and not baking it alone for the additional 5-10.  The result was OK, but I noticed that when I filled the crust, there was so much residual melted butter at the bottom that when I filled it with the filling, some of it pooled near the fluted edge.  It also caused my bottom to be soggy.</p>
<p>Anyway, do you know why I am getting the dome-like shape when I tried to your second par-bake step?  Has this happened to you?  It&#8217;s day after Thanksgiving now, yet, I feel the need to keep at this recipe until it comes out right!!</p>

				<p>I made this pie for Thanksgiving and I will never make a plain old pumpkin pie again.  I got rave reviews from my family.</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,  Just wanted to let you know my Thanksgiving table of 16 adults, all declared this to be the Best Pumpkin Pie they have ever tasted.   All Thanks to you :)</p>
<p>One Q: i used your All Butter Crust &#8211; I had it fluted and edged .5in above the rim, and followed all your chilling techniques &#8211; but sadly my crust shrank terribly in the oven, way below the rim after the first pre-bake and I performed emergency techniques to save it! :)  Any thoughts on where I went wrong?</p>

				<p>I made this for T-giving this year as well and it was a STUNNER. (Also made your mom&#8217;s Apple Cake which my mom declared to possibly be &#8220;the best thing she&#8217;s ever eaten&#8221;). I used a farmers market squash that I had pureed and wanted to just share that I had made a practice run pie that didn&#8217;t turn out as well because my squash had more moisture than what comes in a can&#8230;. so for anyone out there pureeing your own&#8211; be sure to put it over a cheesecloth (I used an old tea towel) and a collander overnight before you try to bake with it.</p>
<p>Also, I ended up having to nearly double the baking time on this bad boy&#8230; but I&#8217;m blaming that on my oven.</p>

				<p>Just discovered your site and I love it.  I always use fresh pumpkin for pumpkin pie. I use a cheese pumpkin which is lighter in color (beige) than a jack o lantern pumpkin.  I cut the pumpkin in half, put it on a cookie sheet  cover with aluminum foil and bake in the oven.  I use the food processor to puree the pumpkin. ( I have never had a problem with it being grainy or stringy once food processed). I ziplock 2 cup batches of pumpkin and then freeze so that I have pumpkin available to me all winter long. I have always used condensed milk in my recipe so I am looking forward to trying the heavy cream and milk.  I also use the cinnamon and ginger spices from Penzeys spices which is far superior than the spices at the supermarket.</p>
