			<p><a href="http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/11-Proven-Ways-Your-Personality-Can-Cause-Health-Problems.png"><img src="http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/11-Proven-Ways-Your-Personality-Can-Cause-Health-Problems.png"></a></p>
<p>A couple of millennia ago, ancient scientists and doctors were already beginning to suspect that there was a link between personality and health. One of the earliest theories on the matter — though long since disproven — was put forth by Greek and later Roman physicians, who believed that good health was the result of balancing four humors in the body (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood), each of which was connected to a corresponding temperament (melancholic, choleric, phlegmatic, and sanguine respectively). Modern science may have disproven this early theory, but it has also shown that the basic principle behind it is in fact quite sound: good health, or lack of it, is in many ways linked to an individual&#8217;s personality traits.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last century, numerous studies have shown that personality traits can have a serious impact on everything from fitness, to health habits, to disease risk, and even on longevity, with certain traits exerting a much larger influence than others. Much of this shouldn&#8217;t be surprising, as those who are prone to taking risks may naturally experience more injuries and illnesses, while those who are conscientious may be more likely to get health issues checked out. Yet often we don&#8217;t think about just how much our personalities, in much less extreme examples, impact our health on a daily basis. Here we share some striking studies on the link between health and personality that may just convince you to make some major personality changes, as your temperament could affect your health, well-being, and, ultimately, how long you live.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111018212346.htm">Disposition has been linked to liking sweets</a>. </h3>
<p>When it comes to personality, we are quite literally what we eat. At least, that&#8217;s what a recent study seems to suggest. Researchers from several universities found links, in both directions, between eating sweet foods and a person&#8217;s disposition. In one example, those who had a preference for sweet foods were more likely to volunteer to help a person in need. Yet, the studies also suggest that those who have sweeter dispositions may simply be more inclined to eat sweets, though the reasons are unclear. With a myriad of problems linked to overconsumption of sugar, this predilection for sweets could have a serious impact on health, even if it does help personality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120123175659.htm">Narcissism has a high health cost for men</a>. </h3>
<p>In Greek mythology, being overly self-involved led to Narcissus&#8217; demise, but science is showing that this old myth isn&#8217;t just a morality tale: it may contain some unpleasant truths. Research at the University of Michigan suggests that scoring high on the narcissism aspect of personality tests (characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, overestimations of uniqueness, and a sense of grandiosity) could have serious negative effects on the health of men. By measuring the level of the stress hormone cortisol in the men participating in the study, researchers found that the inflated view narcissists have of themselves is relatively fragile, causing them to resort to aggression when threatened, have higher blood pressure, and most distressingly, higher levels of chronic stress. All of these factors can lead to serious health problems and potentially shorter life spans, making narcissism not only off-putting but also dangerous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120710093806.htm">Those with higher reward sensitivity are more likely to be influenced by junk food ads</a>. </h3>
<p>Your personality can influence much more than your penchant for sweets, with certain traits actually driving you toward junk food and other unhealthy meals. Research presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior demonstrated that those who are reward-sensitive (a personality trait rooted in the neurobiological dopamine system and often an indicator of addiction risk) are more likely to get an urge to eat after seeing TV ads featuring junk food than those featuring healthy food or no food at all. In women, these effects occur even when being shown a still image of junk food. This effect may cause these individuals to have a much more difficult time controlling what they eat and avoiding unhealthy behaviors that can harm overall health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://www.dukehealth.org/health_library/news/9961">Negative personality traits increase the risk of heart problems</a>. </h3>
<p>Are you a classic Type A personality? While that might be good for your finances, research has shown that it may be taking a serious toll on your health. Those who fall into the Type A personality tend to be more hostile, competitive, intense, and driven. Those traits, especially hostility, were found to correlate with higher rates of coronary heart disease. Type As aren&#8217;t alone, however, in their increased risk of heart problems. Those who are Type D personality, exhibiting high levels of unhappiness, irritation, worry, and social inhibition, are at a substantially greater risk for poorer outcomes, including death, when they face cardiac problems. Regardless of personality type, research has shown that those who have the best chance of staying away from heart disease and surviving heart problems are people who exhibit high levels of openness to new experiences, feelings, actions, and ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-16356/Positive-minded-people-fight-disease.html">Those who are easily stressed, moody, or nervous have weaker immune systems</a>. </h3>
<p>The connection between our brains and our bodies isn&#8217;t something to scoff at, especially since new research is pointing to a strong connection between personality and how individuals cope with illness. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh injected 84 volunteers with a hepatitis vaccine to stimulate an immune response. Those who were found to be moody, nervous, and easily stressed (classic traits of neuroticism) on personality assessments were likewise found to have weaker immune systems. Previous studies found that these individuals were also more likely to report greater numbers of disease symptoms than other patients. Studies like these suggest that personality can actually have marked physical effects that can reduce positive outcomes and make it more difficult for the body to bounce back from illness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/2/165">Mindset can have a huge impact on weight and other health factors</a>. </h3>
<p>Being an optimist or a pessimist is about much more than whether you see the glass half full or half empty. Research is increasingly showing that mindset plays a critical role in a number of health-related issues. In a study done at Harvard in 2007, researchers studied 84 room attendants, one group of which was told that their work was good exercise and satisfied health recommendations, while the other control group was told nothing. Four weeks later, the group who believed they were exercising (despite making no changes in behavior) showed decreases in weight, blood pressure, body fat, waist-to-hip ratios, and BMI at much higher levels than the control group. This is powerful evidence that mindset, which is often governed by your personality, can have a serious effect on your health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/2007/RAND_RP1262.pdf">Neuroticism and conscientiousness play key roles in the development in certain diseases</a>. </h3>
<p>Not only do those with negative personality traits have weakened immune systems, they&#8217;re also much more likely to develop certain diseases. Two of the most important personality traits with regard to health are neuroticism and conscientiousness, both of which have been found to be strong predictors of disease risk. A study done in 2006 revealed several striking correlations. Those who scored high in neuroticism and low conscientiousness not only perceived themselves as being less healthy, they actually were, with higher levels of skin and urinary problems, sciatica, stroke, and TB. Other combinations of traits were also found to cause health problems. Diabetes, high blood pressure, hernia, and bone and joint problems were most prevalent in those testing low in conscientiousness and normal in neuroticism. Ulcers, asthma, bronchitis, and other lung problems were most common in those who tested high in neuroticism and normal in contentiousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://bfi.uchicago.edu/humcap/wp/papers/Deary2010PsychSciPubIntintelligencepersonalityhealth.pdf">Negative personality traits can adversely impact the progression of cancer and HIV</a>.</h3>
<p> There is also evidence that suggests a link between the progression of some serious illnesses and personality. In these cases, negative personality traits don&#8217;t cause illnesses or necessarily even increase the risk of contracting them, but have been found to lead to a greater chance of mortality. Cancer and HIV are two examples of conditions that seem to be exacerbated by negative personality traits. Studies suggest that negative personality traits and depression can cause cancer to spread more rapidly or more aggressively and may even lead to higher rates of death in patients with these traits. Similar results were found in studies of HIV patients, with those showing higher conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness seeing a much slower progression of the disease than those with lower levels of these personality traits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://www.aepc.es/ijchp/articulos_pdf/ijchp-125.pdf">Your personality can impact how you feel pain</a>. </h3>
<p>We often think of our experiences of pain as being purely physical, but there are also key psychological factors that determine how much pain we feel. One of those factors seems to be personality. In one study of lower back pain, those high in hysteria on the MMPI scale had much poorer outcomes in the treatment of this kind of pain. In fact, many with this trait were likely to report continued disability and would not return to work even as much as a year after treatment. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2728051">Other studies</a> have shown that those high in neuroticism report more pain and other bodily symptoms, perhaps both real and imagined. Personality can also influence <a href="http://ukpmc.ac.uk/abstract/MED/3809156/reload=0;jsessionid=80eqfqAgJSBAIxCzV8Zo.12">what conditions cause pain</a> and how much pain, with chronic anxiety being one example. Those who test high in novelty-seeking are more likely to have frequent bodily pain and a lower pain threshold when suffering from chronic anxiety, while those with high harm avoidance often have extreme pain, worry, and fatigue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201009/can-you-survive-your-personality">Personality traits influence how well you take care of yourself</a>. </h3>
<p>Personality doesn&#8217;t just affect how you cope with disease after diagnosis and treatment. It can also alter how to take care of yourself and work to prevent a myriad of different illnesses before they ever occur. Here again, the personality trait of conscientiousness plays a major role in health. A decades-long study of the relationship between health and personality found that people who are high in conscientiousness (which is often expressed through attention to detail, punctuality, and reluctance to procrastinate) actually lived longer than their less conscientious counterparts. A large part of this increased longevity was due to the fact that these individuals simply took better care of themselves and didn&#8217;t put off addressing health issues. Conscientiousness isn&#8217;t the only trait that can have a positive effect on health. Those who test high in agreeableness are healthier, too, as they are more likely to work out and engage in vigorous exercise. It&#8217;s not all bad news for those who aren&#8217;t high in these traits, however, as researchers have found that it is possible, though difficult, to undergo personality changes at any point in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120524215339.htm">Certain personality traits may be linked to your overall longevity</a>.</h3>
<p> All of the ways that personality impacts your health add up to either increased or decreased longevity, and some may simply be predisposed to longer lives through their inborn personality traits. A study released earlier this year found that people who reach age 100 shared many of the same traits, including extraversion, optimism, agreeableness, and humor. As you might suspect from the research we&#8217;ve already presented, centenarians also exhibited low levels of neuroticism and higher levels of conscientiousness. These facts alone isn&#8217;t especially surprising, but the findings also showed that the traits that promote long lives can be linked to certain genes. These personality genes may be just as important in determining whether individuals make it to triple digits as genes that determine many kinds of physiological advantages that allow for long life.</p>
