Thanks for visiting!</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/protein-challenge/" >I discussed protein</a> a little bit, and it&#8217;s such an important topic that I think it deserves its own Tuesday 10 (Read all Tuesday 10 columns <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/category/the-tuesday-10/" >here</a>).</p>
<p>In all the debates this year about sugar (carbohydrates) and hydrogenated oil (fat), we forget that protein warrants consideration as well. Bacon, sausage, deli meat? No, thanks. The wrong proteins in the diet will quickly sabotage optimal health.</p>
<p><strong>Many myths surround protein</strong>. For the record, <a title="but possibly boredom" href="http://www.veggieboards.com/blog/?p=271" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.veggieboards.com']);">vegetarians will not die of protein deprivation</a>. I hope no one believes that anymore. It helps to understand that protein is a macronutrient. What we call &#8220;protein&#8221; is, in fact, a family of amino acid molecules. When grouped together in various combinations we get proteins. There&#8217;s no protein molecule hanging out in that hamburger; rather, the animal tissue is made of many different amino acid building blocks. Protein is just a catch-all term we use. This is why vegetarians won&#8217;t keel over as people once feared. (However, I still recommend meat consumption, and for a number of reasons: caloric efficiency, blood sugar management, and human biology. It takes more calories to get adequate amounts of protein on a vegetarian diet. Living on beans and tofu increases the amount of carbohydrates in one&#8217;s diet significantly. And the human body most certainly handles &#8211; and benefits from &#8211; a bit of flesh. But I digress.)</p>
<p><strong>Here are my ten ideal sources of protein, and their popular but inferior counterparts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>10. Winner: Grass-Fed Beef</strong></p>
<p><strong>Loser: hamburger meat</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve discussed the <a title="yum, hundreds of cows in a single bite!" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/meat/" >problems with hamburger meat</a> before. I will not eat a meal that includes parts of literally hundreds of dead beasts. I think that&#8217;s pretty heinous. That&#8217;s just me. Moreover, the average cow is raised on cheap grain that will kill it after about six months (they&#8217;re conveniently slaughtered before this happens &#8211; but not always). Hardly something I want to put in my body. Grass-fed, organic beef won&#8217;t make the vegetarians happy, but this beef is rich in beneficial fatty acids that are missing from the factory-raised cattle. It&#8217;s cleaner, healthier, more flavorful, and richer in nutrients. And grass-fed beef is typically raised in humane conditions. If you eat beef, grass-fed is a must. It&#8217;s getting quite easy to find these days, but you can order online from many outlets as well.</p>
<p><strong>9. Winner: Organic Chicken</strong></p>
<p><strong>Loser: regular frozen chicken</strong></p>
<p>No comparison. Did you know chicken has flavor? Yeah, bizarre, I know. Chicken raised properly (not shoved by the cluckload into dirty factories) is rich in EFAs and is one of the most efficient, lean sources of protein available.</p>
<p><strong>8. Winner: Wild Salmon</strong></p>
<p><strong>Loser: farmed salmon</strong></p>
<p>Fish is healthy, right? Don&#8217;t even bother patting yourself on the back for eating salmon if it&#8217;s from a farm. Farmed salmon is produced in a way that&#8217;s the seaside equivalent of a chicken factory. As a result, the fish are often sick and infected. They&#8217;re fed cheap feed that does not yield the desirable Omega-3-rich flesh. They&#8217;re miserable.</p>
<p>Stick with wild only. Most restaurants use farmed salmon, so you have to get a little aggressive about this.</p>
<p>Notice a trend here with my emphasis on good fats in protein foods? Source makes a huge difference in the quality of protein you get. Meat is &#8211; or was &#8211; a very valuable food because it&#8217;s so dense in nutritious fat and protein. What an efficient, rich source of energy! Helpfully, our modern factories have eliminated the nutritional value and left us with weak, flabby, carcinogenic, diseased patties and drumsticks. Hey, thanks, guys. (Although we consumers don&#8217;t get off easy: maybe if we <em>ate</em> less&#8230;)</p>

<p><strong>7. Winner: Tuna fish</strong></p>
<p><strong>Loser: fish sticks and popcorn shrimp</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I need to go into this one.</p>
<p><strong>6. Winner: Organic DHA-Enhanced Eggs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Loser: egg substitute and/or regular eggs</strong></p>
<p>If eggs were meant to be eaten as mechanically-separated, low-fat, chemically-altered whites in a carton, the chickens would have done it by now. But an egg is a chick in the making. It&#8217;s rich in antioxidants, good fats, vitamins, and &#8211; for the calories &#8211; a lot of protein. Things like Egg Beaters are the result of food manufacturers exploiting fears based on grossly inaccurate health information. There&#8217;s nothing healthy about such unnatural products.</p>
<p><strong>5. Winner: Organic, Plain, European (Greek) Yogurt</strong></p>
<p><strong>Loser: regular yogurt</strong></p>
<p>No comparison. The European stuff is richer, fattier, more nutritious and lower in sugar. Again, when choosing an animal protein source, choose one that also provides valuable fats to maximize nutrition. Don&#8217;t go for the conventional animal products that are high in chemicals, hormones, bad fats, and sugars. Yogurt isn&#8217;t a staple of my diet, but if I eat it it&#8217;s certainly not a plastic cup of sugar-infused strawberry dessert.</p>

<p><strong>4. Winner: Tempeh</strong></p>
<p><strong>Loser: tofu and &#8220;mock meats&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Fermented foods ought to be part of everyone&#8217;s diet, vegetarian or not. <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/10-things-to-know-about-tofu/" >Tempeh</a> is one that is chewy and delicious, even to die-hard burger fans. It&#8217;s healthy and a much better bet than heavily processed tofu or &#8220;mock meats&#8221; that are brimming with poor-quality modified proteins, sodium, chemicals and starchy fillers. In my opinion it doesn&#8217;t compare nutritionally or in taste to a juicy steak but as vegetarian options go it ain&#8217;t half bad.</p>
<p><strong>3. Winner(s):  Quinoa</strong></p>
<p><strong>Loser(s): green beans &amp; any large, starchy bean: kidney, great northern, lima</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, green beans are decent veggies. But these &#8220;beans&#8221; contain very little protein. Kidney, northern, navy, lima and other starchy beans are also rather limited in their protein amounts and contain a high amount of carbohydrates. Quinoa (pronounced &#8220;keen-wah&#8221;) is a so-called &#8220;complete protein&#8221; grain &#8211; the only one of which I&#8217;m aware. Though I stay away from grains entirely, for a vegetarian protein option you could do much worse.</p>

<p><strong>2. Winner: Almonds and Almond Butter</strong></p>
<p><strong>Loser: peanuts and peanut butter</strong></p>
<p>Peanuts are one of the least nutritious nuts (and they&#8217;re not technically a true nut anyway). When adding a handful of nuts to your salad for protein, go with almonds. Almond butter is less toxic and allergenic than peanut butter, although the protein amounts are similar by comparison (between 6 and 8 grams, usually). Still, this is about quality protein, not necessarily the amount. When it comes to protein, people often think that &#8220;more is more&#8221;. A giant steak will certainly give you &#8220;more&#8221; protein, but if it&#8217;s conventionally raised and is an unreasonable portion size, it&#8217;ll give you a whole lot more trouble, too.</p>
<p><strong>1. What&#8217;s <em>your</em> favorite protein source?</strong></p>
<p>Give me a shout, Apples. What protein do you favor? What have I left out? (To comment, simply click on Comments below to log in to the blog forum, or proceed directly to the <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/forum" >forum</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>N</strong><strong>ote</strong>: &#8220;Cows&#8217; milk is for baby cows,&#8221; the saying goes. <strong>You&#8217;ll notice I left cheese and milk out of this list</strong>. I think dairy is less than ideal for human consumption, though I do like yogurt because it&#8217;s a fermented food. Raw dairy is healthy and enjoyable for many people, but generally, I think quality meat is better for you than quality milk. Less processed cheeses such as ricotta, buffalo mozzarella, goat cheese and mascarpone are superior to more heavily processed cheddar, colby and jack. I think a little cream and butter are fine in cooking, because I don&#8217;t fear saturated fat, but I am concerned about folks who substitute lean, nutritious meat with highly-processed cheese.</p>

										<p>Kidney beans don&#8217;t deserve the bad rap you give them.  Like their colorful cousins, red, black, and pinto beans, kidney beans are high in flavonoids.  The flavonoid mix differs among the varieties, so it&#8217;s good to include all of them in your diet.  Kidney beans are larger and thus starchier than black or pinto, but the differences in carbs, protein, and fiber are not significant.  </p>
<p>Beans are appropriate in small quantities as a side dish along with generous servings of produce.  Heme iron enhances the absorption of non-heme iron, so I try to include a little animal protein with my beans.  As a non-menopausal woman, I&#8217;m not likely to suffer from iron overload, especially with my relatively low protein consumption.</p>

										<p>No grains, even quinoa have all the essential amino acids so cannot be considered a complete protein.  However these ingredients are often mixed with others that contain incomplete amino acids to form complete ones. This is called &#8220;mutual supplemaentation&#8221;  You just mix two items with incomplete amino acids so that one makes up for the loss of the other.    Hummus and pita is a good example and a tasty one at that!</p>
<p>I love tempeh, but even that can come mass produced. There are some places that still hand craft tofu, and it is excellent!  even to a meat eater like me!</p>
<p>My favorite protein is a toss up between three; malpeque oysters, lentil and quinoa salad, or grass fed beef from Georgia, Texas, or Florida.  Since I live in Canada I guess I&#8217;ll go with the oysters for the rare treat.  But as for daily protein I&#8217;ll go with the lentil and quinoa salad.</p>

										<p>I think the best sort of dietary suggestions are ones based on data. Evidence that cow or goat&#8217;s milk is harmful for human consumption is negligible- in fact, much to the contrary. For many people, it is their largest source of calcium.<br />
    Similarly, there is little evidence that organic vegetables are healthier. If you can afford it, and think that it is in your best interest to eat organic, go ahead. However, it would be extremely difficult to feed most of the world&#8217;s population if mass-produced foods were eliminated entirely.<br />
    People seem to think that foods are all or nothing- it isn&#8217;t healthier to eliminate grains entirely from your diet. At a certain point, proteins are converted into the same fat cells as grains. The fact remains that most of the food you eat is converted into energy, not muscle, and it doesn&#8217;t particularly matter whether you get it from pasta or chicken, as long as you consume a decent amount of protein.<br />
     A balanced, varied diet is the best diet.</p>

<p>That is probably very true, but then how did the world become so populated in the first place?  Healthy people in more isolated, primitive groups tend to have fewer children by choice (it&#8217;s not simply a result of disease killing off most of them&#8230; see Weston A. Price&#8217;s &#8220;Nutrition and Physical Degeneration&#8221;).  Also it&#8217;s not the job of those in the West to try desperately to save every starving human being in the rest of the world, even if we&#8217;ve been browbeaten into believing that it is.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact remains that most of the food you eat is converted into energy, not muscle, and it doesn’t particularly matter whether you get it from pasta or chicken, as long as you consume a decent amount of protein.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, I suggest reading &#8220;Nutrition and Physical Degeneration&#8221;.  It&#8217;s a fantastic book and will absolutely amaze you.  Very old though and it&#8217;s difficult to find a copy, but the whole thing is available online: <a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200251h.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','gutenberg.net.au']);" rel="nofollow">http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200251h.html</a></p>

										<p>Dude, you&#8217;re so wrong!!! Cow milk is definitely bad for you. It contains unnecessary saturated fats and hormones for the cow to produce milk faster, as well as blood, YUMMY!! Organic anything is better, NO EFFING DOUBT. And it does matter whether or not you get it from pasta or chicken; those are two totally different food items. One being from an animal and the other, a grain. One is a complete protein, and the other isn&#8217;t. You&#8217;re right on the balanced and varied diet though. Fad diets are dumb, &#8217;cause all you need is moderate exercise and knowledge of the food guide pyramid.</p>

<p>If people were smart they&#8217;d shirk their brainwashing and empty monetary conditioning so families could grow all of their own food &#8211; this is entirely possible to do in any climate. Scarcity is a myth  propagated by the Captains of Industry to further their own profit of worthless created-out-of-debt, backed-by-nothing cotton-linen paper and empty digital data.</p>

										<p>check out the China Study that looked at the population of rural China and the occurance of cancer.  It concluded that the consumation of dairy and meet,as a primary part of the diet has a direct connection to higher rates of all types of cancer and illness.  After all if we were ment to eat meet why do we have to cook it and why do most mammals ween their young off milk at around 6 months and we continue to drink it our whole lives.  Not to mention that we are the only mammals that drink the milk of another mammal.</p>

										<p>Your father milked cows that were only 250 pounds?  What&#8217;s he milking &#8211; calves? Don&#8217;t have much faith in his skills/opinions.  And we eat their meat &#8211; by that logic shouldn&#8217;t that cause the same health problems?<br />
Anyway, trust me, most (if not all) cows/bulls would continue to drink milk into their old age if someone (mom, the farmer) would let them/feed it to them.  Cats drink milk their whole lives too &#8211; dogs would too but it&#8217;s not a &#8216;tradition&#8217; to do so, so people don&#8217;t feed it to them.<br />
Some people can&#8217;t tolerate milk &#8211; they shouldn&#8217;t drink it.  Doesn&#8217;t mean other people can&#8217;t or that it isn&#8217;t a healthy food.  Some people are deathly allergic to nuts &#8211; doesn&#8217;t mean no one should eat them.</p>
<p>One thing for sure: No animals besides humans cook their food.  Would your dad suggest we shouldn&#8217;t either?  <img src='http://cdn.marksdailyapple.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

										<p>how thick are you? because we eat meat milk is fine. then you go on to say &#8216;trust me&#8217;&#8230; milk is drank my calves that have four stomachs, we have one&#8230;<br />
and the point about not cooking food which side of the argument are you on? you shouldn&#8217;t cook food it reduces the content. you cook food to improve the taste but with veg your cooking away the minerals and vitamins.</p>

										<p>WHAT !!!<br />
If wolves had a way to milk a cow, they would drink her milk and for that matter cows themselves. Try giving an adult dog or a cat milk and see what happens. Guess what, they love it. haha</p>
<p>And why is not eating meat of a 250 lb animal(actually cows are more like 1000 lb or more) does not make you wonder why we have health problems?</p>

										<p>Cows milk is designed for calves the same as human milk is designed for babies&#8230;cows milk varies in protein, calcium, essential fatty acids as wel as others &#8211; which can have massive consequences on feeding a babies on cows milk.<br />
As with adults milk is constantly promtoed as a good source of calcium, but what is not mentioned is calcium works along side magnesium. The optimum ratio is 2:1..in milk the ratio of calcium to magnesium is 10:1. So too much milk could cause a deficiency and imbalance.<br />
But dont get me wrong im a great fan of milk if its from a good source, as long as its not a huge part of someones weekly diet.</p>

										<p>the highest source of protein is&#8230;.a blue green algea called Spirulina! By precentage of protein it is over 60% which is higher than beef. It also is fabulous in fro yo, yogurt, apple sauce, shakes, healthy baked goods. Plus a power house of minerals omegas and your body easily assimulates it compared to harder to digest proteins..&#8221;its not what you eat it&#8217;s what you assimulate&#8221;&#8230;. I like that you can add superior protein to carb foods without altering the taste too much. Have to add Kefir to the list which is better than yogurt. I make my own from raw milk add probiotics and it is perfection.</p>

										<p>Garbonzo beans are great as well as they have about 6ish grams of protein per cup and while low calories can keep you going for hours. An egg per day is a good source as well as long as you remove the yolk as that has 100% of the fat in eggs.</p>

										<p>Being a strict vegan and nutbutter head, I think it way cool that almond butter made number two on this list.</p>
<p>But, I balance almond butter, chick peas (via hummous), peanut butter and soy milk, to get most of my protein, with splendid results.</p>
<p>Thus, I would remove peanut butter from the &#8216;evil counterparts to good proteins list&#8217; and would remove raw soy as well.<br />
Both are excellent, assuming a lack of allergies.</p>
<p>I would also recommend having almonds and peanuts in butter form, since they need to be ground up good to digest. Walnuts and pecans, on the other hand, can be had by the handful.<br />
Chick peas as hummous? Just a preference here.</p>
<p>And, if I can ever find a genuinely cruelty free form of dairy, I will revert to lacto-vegetarian form from strict vegan since 1996 (vegetarian since 1987).<br />
Fresh milk is definitely better than any meat for all nutritional purposes.</p>
<p>But, other than that.<br />
Not bad!</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

										<p>hmmmm. I am still not convinced as to why egg whites in a carton are not a viable/healthy source of protein. Your argument against them seems more based on personal opinion than fact. I could use your same argument and claim that if we were meant to eat cooked beef the cow would produce it that way. Or that cleaning a fish (i.e removing the scale/bones/guts) isn&#8217;t the proper way nature intended us to eat it. Just because a food is processed doesn&#8217;t mean it is loaded with sodium and preservatives and chemicals. The ONLY ingredient listed on the egg white carton is 100% Egg whites. NO preservatives or anything else. If they are lying let me know and we will alert the FDA.<br />
    What is the difference between mechanically separated egg whites and &#8220;humanly&#8221; separated egg whites other than speed?<br />
    Am I wrong in saying that all the pasteurization process does is kill off bacteria and restructures the amino acids in the egg whites allowing for their protein to be absorbed during digestion&#8230;the same process that would occur when cooking eggs from the shell at home?<br />
   I usually use egg whites from a carton for smoothies for several reasons. 1. I don&#8217;t want to risk the possibility that an egg white I separate myself contains harmful bacteria 2. As an egg needs to be heated in order to make its protein absorbent, it would be very hard to imitate the pasteurization process at home while maintaining the egg white&#8217;s liquid form. 3. It&#8217;s very wasteful and time consuming separating eggs.<br />
   In no way am I saying that overall, an egg white is better for you than an Organic DHA-Enhanced Egg from the shell. I agree that the egg yolk contains has many nutritional benefits, i.e vitamins, minerals, etc etc, but your post is specifically on sources of Protein not anything else&#8230; and your argument on egg whites seems more against it&#8217;s packaging than its health benefits. When my butcher separates the meat from the cow is he not processing it? When wraps it in paper or cellophane wrap is that not an unnatural container for it? If I am wrong please let me know. But not based on that a carton is unappetizing to you. Give facts as to way the protein value in egg whites in a carton is somehow less than a normal eggs.</p>

										<p>&#8220;As someone who appreciates the Buddhist idea of ahimsa, I fully appreciate the motive to not harm any living thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since when were plants not living things? If we did not eat living things, we would soon be extinct (rule #1), that is after our species dies out from eating the garbage we sometimes call food (see rule #1) I agree with eating wisely, but don&#8217;t rule out an entire kingdom (one of the only two kingdoms: plants and animals) as not living. If you mean, do no harm to the animal kingdom, then be careful what bugs you squash daily. Don&#8217;t swat that mosquito! Also are you careful not to wear leather or have leather wallets &#8211; how about wool clothing&#8230;</p>

										<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I agree with you 100% Geoff. Carton egg whites are fine and the FDA requires they put any additives on the ingredient list right? Mine also just says 100% egg whites &#8211; so what&#8217;s the problem? I&#8217;m guessing I&#8217;m not going to find much value on this website because I also add fat free cheddar to my carton of egg whites (also a no no according to this post) and top it all off with a healthy portion of low-fat cottage cheese for lunch. Oh well, I guess I&#8217;ll move on to another site I can agree with. <img src='http://cdn.marksdailyapple.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

										<p>Eating egg whites only, to me is like eating rice cakes. What&#8217;s the point? The yolk is, in my opinion,  the most important and nutritious part of the egg. Also, I personally do not believe in wasting anything and if an egg yolk is the worst thing I am consuming than I think I would be pretty well off.</p>

										<p>Michael, your post, like your diet, lacks balance. Nothing wrong in combining meat and vegetable to create a nutritious meal.</p>
<p>Lions kill and eat animals every day. They have evolved to be carnivorous, it&#8217;s just what they do, there&#8217;s nothing wrong about it.</p>
<p>Likewise, we have evolved to be omnivorous (yes, even you) for a reason. Sure, we can choose to go one way. But don&#8217;t be fooled into believing that the choice you have made is the better choice.</p>

										<p>how patronizing. </p>
<p>anyway monkeys have canines dont see them eating meat. and comparing us to Other animals doesnt work as we have (as meat eaters will continuously tell me) greater intelligence, what i get from that is that we have the intelligence to choose what to eat and to be able to survive without eating meat. being a vegetarian you can get everything you need for a balanced diet, you just have to eat much more. there are an unbelievable amount of reasons to be vegetarian (or not to eat meat).</p>
<p>3 are:</p>
<p>hunger in the world. land used for a few cows could instead be used for thousands of crops.</p>
<p>health benefits. a much lower risk of cancer.</p>
<p>Fat bastards. you can eat as much veg as you like, its hard to become obese.</p>
<p>i am of course talking about vegetarians that enjoy all types of vegetable, not vegetarians that just eat bread and cheese.</p>
<p>there will always be deaths, humans and other animals. it cant be avoided but that should not be taken as a reason to increase those deaths.</p>
<p>eatin meat is necessary in the wild. i&#8217;m a vegetarian ifi had no choice and it was eat meat or die i would eat meat, for me it is purely a choice thing. and all i can see for eating meat is the taste. that is it.</p>
<p>you are taking lives. even if those lives mean nothing to you and look meager compared to yours. </p>
<p>As a race we&#8217;re an arrogant bunch of cunts.</p>
<p>(ps. jason is a meat eater that shows some understanding, thanks jason. i normally find the answer given by meat eaters to vegetarians to be all too similar to the &#8216;stupid&#8217; animals they&#8217;re killing)</p>

										<p>Michael,  I have been a vegetarian for some time and I appreciate your stance.  Only recently, I have begun to rethink this &#8211; after a review here of Lierre Keith&#8217;s book &#8220;The Vegetarian Myth&#8221;.  While I am still researching this, I think the most poignant point made by Keith in her book is that we vegetarians are fooling ourselves if we think that our non-meat diet doesn&#8217;t result in the death of MANY animals.  This is especially true if we have a largely grain-based diet which has caused near total destruction of the habitats of many (thousands?) of creatures.</p>
<p>Our food &#8211; and therefore our life &#8211; depends on other things dying for us.  It is a fact we cannot escape.</p>

										<p>There is no doubt that the simple fact that we are alive will result in animals being displaced and no matter our diet, there will be animal deaths. However, given the fact that we cannot eliminate All deaths, should we not still strive for the Least deaths possible? Causing the least harm possible?<br />
Massive quantities of the grain we grow is used to feed animals in CAFOs. Thus not only are there wild animals dying in the fields, we are then killing yet more for our plates. And, even if you look at the diet of eating 100% free range beef (with No finishing at feedlots), 100% free range dairy, and no consumption of eggs &#8211; the numbers of animal deaths are still higher than that of a veg*n diet. </p>
<p>Steven Davis wrote a paper that attempted to show that veg*nism caused more death &#8211; but (the Many other flaws with his paper aside), when the math on his paper was corrected, it in fact showed that veg*ns cause the least death. [http://homepage.uab.edu/nnobis/papers/least-harm.pdf]  </p>
<p>So again &#8211; since as long as we are alive, something will die, does that mean that we should give up and kill unnecessarily, or that, during our time here, we should strive to take the fewest lives possible..to cause the least harm.</p>

										<p>cont..<br />
Based on your post, I&#8217;m thinking you would agree with the latter. In which case &#8211; instead of reverting back to consuming meat, should we not be looking at ways to further reduce the harm &amp; death we cause? Be it buying local &amp; in season, growing our own gardens, limiting grain consumption, buying organic, funding alternate harvesting methods, the list goes on.</p>
<p>It seems to me that while veg*nism is ~not~ perfect and still does cause death, it is the best option we currently have &#8211; and as such, it is a base from which we can take steps to yet further reduce our impact.</p>

										<p>Jason,</p>
<p>These are some wonderful points that I will look into.  Thank you for taking the time to offer them here.</p>
<p>While doing this research, I am also going to consider as many relevant factors as possible.  For instance, is death of animals necessarily bad? (I&#8217;m of course not arguing for completely unnecessary death, nor am I arguing in favor of the torture of animals in CAFOs.) If causing the death of animals is bad (seemingly an obvious point for someone who has been a vegetarian for moral reasons), then of course the diet that causes the least death is the most bad.  I don&#8217;t know the answer to that question, though, so I will have to think more about it. As someone who appreciates the Buddhist idea of ahimsa, I fully appreciate the motive to not harm any living thing.</p>
<p>The second question is whether or not we are, by nature, &#8220;intended&#8221; to eat meat. (I say &#8220;intended&#8221; to mean by evolution, not deistic intent.) I don&#8217;t know the answer to this question either.  It seems to me there are convincing arguments both in favor of and against humans eating meat.  So I don&#8217;t know that either, and will have to continue to research this topic.</p>
<p>What I wish is that more people would ask these questions.  It seems obvious to me that we should grow absolutely as much food as we can.  And if we decide to eat meat, it should be in limited quantities from local, sustainable sources.  </p>
<p>And if grain has led to civilization, then it has also led to the destruction of the planet.  A VERY limited grain intake seems necessary.</p>
<p>Anyhow, thank you again for your comments.</p>

										<p>Hi Lance,</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve left me with a few things to think about as well.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a few thoughts:<br />
&gt; is death of animals necessarily bad?<br />
I think this is a good question in so far as, like most things, to me, it is not always so black and white. I personally wouldn&#8217;t necessarily always place a value judgment on death; at least not on a high level. To me, for better or worse, death is a part of life. And there are times when one needs to kill in order to live. </p>
<p>For instance, someone living &#8216;in the middle of nowhere&#8217; &#8211; there aren&#8217;t grocery stores around, it is ~many~ miles to get to any version of a store, and in the winter, those miles are snowed in. So what happens when the rice and beans run low and the winter is uncharacteristically long? What happens if winter came early &#8211; before you had a chance to stock up on rice and beans?<br />
Or, for the many in the world who are poor &#8211; vegetarianism is often a default diet because it is cheaper; however, if offered an animal for slaughter and consumption, they’d be turning down a chance to feed their families.</p>
<p>But, in all of these cases, it comes down to need.<br />
I shall never walk out my door and shoot someone &#8211; even if it&#8217;s not random – be it that person made me mad, or I know I can get that person&#8217;s ATM card. In my mind, reasons or not, I am simply fulfilling a personal want and thus the killing is blatantly wrong. But if I were attacked &#8211; if I had to kill in order to survive, I view the taking of this life as quite different from one that is not necessary. And, my views remain the same when it comes to taking the life of any being, regardless of species. </p>
<p>So I don&#8217;t personally view it as always good or always bad. But, to me, if we have an underlying respect for life (which I think you&#8217;ll agree is greatly lacking nowadays), how can we indiscriminately kill? How can we justify taking life merely out of want? And if we don&#8217;t need that death, is it anything but killing for want?</p>
<p>Q2 &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure either. I&#8217;ve seen arguments on both sides. My belief at this point is that our systems are that of a minimal omnivore. It seems that a majority of our systems line up with herbivores. But, a small percentage does not. Thus, my impression at this point is that we were &#8216;created&#8217; to eat both, but with a *high* plant content.</p>
<p>However, the &#8216;design&#8217; of our bodies is from many, many years of evolution. And none of those years had grocery stores. None of those years had agriculture. We were &#8216;created&#8217; long before there were crops. So while the &#8216;design&#8217; of our system may allow us to consume eggs, flesh, and plants &#8211; this does not by any means mean we have to. The &#8216;design&#8217; was simply the version of us that won and was able to thrive under the circumstances. Nowadays, we live in completely different circumstances and thus, to me, whether or not my ancestor&#8217;s ancestors ate flesh is ultimately irrelevant if I don&#8217;t have to to thrive. </p>
<p>That said, I do think that though one could also attempt to emulate the original diet. it would be quite difficult as it would be purely hunting and gathering. (Cows, modern pigs, chickens, etc are a far cry from the original animals.)  And in all actuality, when it comes to the least harm, I think that if the person hunting is quite skilled and shows enormous respect, this quite possibly is equal to or less harm than a veg*n diet. However, it is not sustainable on a large scale; there is simply not enough wilderness left to have the general public going out to get their food. (And, while it may be equal on a harm scale, that is based on the assumption that you have people who have a great respect for life going out there. This is a false premise if we all pack up the neighbors and head out to the woods to do us some shootin&#8217; and drinking and stomping on all the plants. Thus again, to me, (since I go at it from a least harm view), the hunting method is knocked off the list as an option of how to &#8216;be the change you wish to see&#8217;.)</p>
<p>As for growing food, I am happy that it ~seems~ that more and more people are starting to look at those giant patches of grass in front of their houses and wonder why they&#8217;re there instead of other plants (or food!). It’s a slow process, and ultimately seems to have taken a greater hold simply due to the economy. But, whatever the reason, I&#8217;m quite happy that the seed has been planted that we don&#8217;t all have to purchase everything. We have lawns to rip up; we have community gardens; we even have vacant lots. No matter what, we can be growing some of our food (and support our local farmers instead of regularly purchasing out of season products from thousands of miles away.)</p>
<p>I do agree with you on the meat front &#8211; quadruply so with the limited quantities. Putting aside all value judgments on taking a life or not, the current American meat at every meal diet is beyond unsustainable. It is (literally) killing us and it is killing the planet. I do wish more people would see the connection and/or act upon what they see (the latter being the hardest as we are quite resistant to giving up our personal wants for the benefit of either our future needs, or the greater good&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p>When it comes to grain &#8211; have you read Ishmael? I&#8217;m sure the concept has been introduced elsewhere, but it also was introduced in Ishmael that essentially, the beginning of our demise was agriculture.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if grains are the devil so to speak. Personally, I&#8217;ve been of the mindframe that I also read in Ishmael &#8211; that it is simply agriculture in general. Which actually personally led me on the &#8216;if agriculture has done great harm, how can I/we live in ways that don&#8217;t depend on it&#8217; which again lead to hunting and gathering..and then lead back to veg*nism due to the implementation/sustainability issues of hunting/gathering.<br />
In many ways, I wish similar question had been asked many years ago &#8211; when the wilderness was prevalent and going back to basics could sustain us all.</p>
<p>Anyway, I appreciate your reply. If you have any further thoughts, I&#8217;d be interested in hearing them. And if not, kind regards.</p>

										<p>The vast majority of grain being grown is for animal feed. The amount of grain it takes per lb of meet is ridiculously disproportionate. When it comes to the environment, pollution, and destruction of rain forests etc., see it for what it is.</p>

										<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, everybody is entitled to eat and believe what ever the want, I just don&#8217;t follow the reasoning that vegetarians and vegans give for their dieting choices. I am quite spiritual and believe that everything has an energy which comes from the source of life itself. Therefore, if I were to think the same way, I think I would starve to death.<br />
Also, there is not one animal or plant or organism in the world that would not feed on you if it had the chance. I believe that vegans and vegetarians only choose to live that way for the same reason that people believe in different religions or have to have big houses or nice cars, so they have some sort of idea of themselves that they can say &#8220;this is me&#8221;, &#8220;this is who I am&#8221; because when push comes to shove that is all people care about, who they are.</p>

										<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure what you say here may apply to some or many vegetarians/vegans/pescetarians/etc&#8230; But I think it&#8217;s a rather broad generalization to apply to everyone who chooses not to eat meat or animal products. </p>
<p>Personally, I do not have a problem with the consumption of animal products if the animals are raised and treated humanely. Unfortunately, because most Americans choose meat as their main course and eat it with every meal, factory farms have to exist to fill the need. I&#8217;d been considering giving up meat and seeing the video below made my mind up. I think people who choose not to eat meat at all help balance out the people who eat far too much meat.<br />
<a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/video/index.html?fr_story=fddfc1d63c358bb2db36b53597ceeb7b724f5771&#038;fr_chl=222751a84208af937ad836e8b89a08d42163259e" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','www.humanesociety.org']);" rel="nofollow">http://www.humanesociety.org/video/index.html?fr_story=fddfc1d63c358bb2db36b53597ceeb7b724f5771&#038;fr_chl=222751a84208af937ad836e8b89a08d42163259e</a></p>
<p>Not eating meat is not an &#8216;identity&#8217; for me. I&#8217;m not a vegetarian, then Stephanie. I&#8217;m Stephanie and I&#8217;ll choose the veggie wrap.</p>

										<p>Oh, boy. Brian, I think you make a few good points, but I have to disagree with you when you mention that vegans and vegetarians make their food choices so that they can say &#8220;this is me&#8221;. With all due respect, it is an ignorant assumption, coming from someone who has never been on the personal journey that led them to remove meat from their diets in the first place. I think that your answer would change if you realized the amount of soul-searching and fact-checking that most people go through in order to eventually change their eating habits. And, if image were the real reason people declared themselves vegan or vegetarian, there would be many more egotistical, pretentious people touting their vegetarianism. </p>
<p>Ironically, most people become vegan/veg because they are the opposite of selfish. They instead remove themselves from the equation and look at things from the big picture perspective, thinking about others: the animals, of course, the people who are forced to work in the miserable conditions of CAFO&#8217;s, the people who live around these facilities who are constantly sick because of the air and water quality that is affected from the runoffs of the farms, and their children and grandchildren who will undoubedtly be faced with cleaning up the mess that previous generations have left. </p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s important to realize that myself, as well as probably many other vegetarians, don&#8217;t find it necessary to wear the term like a badge. In fact, most of my friends and acquainances are not even aware that I am vegetarian. The only time I bring it up is when I am in a situation that it calls for, for example, if I am invited over to a dinner and I have to let the host know. I rarely talk about it, unless of course someone is genuinely interested in what led me to my decision.  </p>
<p>Also, I do not drive a fancy car or live in a big house. But if I did, I&#8217;d probably have the money to hire a personal chef that could prepare all of my vegetarian meals and make my life a lot easier.</p>

<p>tho i also know it would be stupid of you to believe me, as there aren&#8217;t any truly moral people in the world. so how can i be one?</p>

										<p>I never understand the vegan standpoint.   Granted, eating animals may seem cruel, but what about the plants.   What if they have feelings too?   Eat no animals and eat no plants.   What&#8217;s left to eat but chemicals, toxins and plastic.  <img src='http://cdn.marksdailyapple.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />    This is why I eat a little of everything, as nature had intended us to in the first place.</p>

										<p>Most people have no idea where the animal products they consume come from and I hope those that don&#8217;t know would be shocked at the deplorable conditions pigs, cows, and chickens are raised in and the torturous life their forced to endure so that we can buy their flesh, eggs and milk in the pretty, sanitary packages we find at our grocery stores. </p>
<p>For me it is not a question of whether it is morally wrong to eat meat. If the animals are treated humanly while they live and they are humanely killed I don&#8217;t have a problem with supporting the farmer raised, sold and slaughtered them. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, most people eat meat as their main course for every single meal. First &#8211; that is not healthy. We do not need that much protein. Second  &#8211; and for me most important &#8211; that creates a huge demand for meat that humane farming could never keep up with. Therefore factory farms that treat animals so horribly have to exist to fill this great lust for meat. </p>
<p>I choose not to eat livestock or their products to do my part to lessen my consumption to a responsible level and make up for someone else who won&#8217;t be willing to make the same choice. It sounds like it you eat a highly varied diet, you may already have lessened your consumption (or always have had a low consumption) of meat. That&#8217;s really all I think we should all feel obligated to do. </p>
<p>Thanking the next step to abstaining from all meat or all of any particular group of animal products is a personal choice. I won&#8217;t judge anyone for not making the same chose that I do and I expect them not to judge me. </p>
<p>I replied to Brian above, but there was a link in the reply so it is still waiting approval, but this sums up what I said to him. </p>
<p>I can only speak for myself, but being a vegetarian is not an identity. I choose not to eat livestock, much like I choose who to vote for, may choose not to patron a store whose business practices I disagree with and choose to adopt pets rather than support breeders. My identity is not made up of any one of these choices, but rather all of them and many more.</p>

										<p>I may have been vague in my post, but I wasn&#8217;t quite prepared to give everybody step by step information on how exactly to eat. But yes, you are right people are used to eating way too much meat, usually half their meal consists of it. You should limit your meat intake to at most 1/3 of your total meal. And what&#8217;s more; believe it or not, but this ravaging blood thirsty meat eater doesn&#8217;t eat meat at every meal. I believe you need to eat a variety of food, to meet all the needs your body has.<br />
As for clean, moral farms not being able to keep up with the demands of us meat eating humans, I own and operate a family business and in my world when you become busier your business grows with it. Also, there would probably be more farmers if more profitable. I don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re from, but all I see happening at farms in my area is the farmer growing farther into debt until the farm shuts down, because the big chain grocers and restaurants can buy their meat and produce for ten cents less a pound. Last week I had a farmer buy $50 worth of diesel fuel and he paid with a $50 bill from 1937. Probably the first one he had ever had. But you had better not make his farm anymore busy. Now, one thing I would like to know is if everybody who thinks so much about where their meat comes from (which is a good thing), also puts as much thought into where their produce and nuts come from. Most of them are grown in inhumane crowed conditions, sprayed with pesticides and fertilized in manure from the same cows that you all refuse to eat.(Which again, a good thing). The same companies own and operate all of these super farms. Super farms are just that, farms that mass produce everything, not just meat, with little or no regard to quality of their product or lasting effects on the consumer and unless you are buying local you are probably supporting one of these farms, and if you aren&#8217;t then you have to be supporting a local farm (which is good). So tell me, Stephanie, which one are you? The one who supports the mean produce, beef, chicken and pork farmers (like you say we shouldn&#8217;t) or the one who is putting a &#8220;strain&#8221; on local farmers (again, like you say we shouldn&#8217;t) because you can&#8217;t be doing neither you have to get food from somewhere.<br />
 And finally this leads me to your identity. Being a vegetarian is not  an identity in itself, (you would be very boring if it was). It is however, one of many things that make up your identity. You identify with you diet, the same way you identify with your perfume or cologne, it&#8217;s pieces of you that make up a whole. Maybe you don&#8217;t identify with it as much as the next person, but trust me when I say you do to an extent. If you didn&#8217;t, you would have a clearer mind on the subject, which you don&#8217;t considering as you do not hold your produce and nuts to the same measure as you hold your meat. This tells me that you need to defend your point of thought in order to keep that part of your identity alive. So yes, the vegetarian belief that you&#8217;ve instilled in your life has become a part of you whether you like it or not.<br />
  The moral of the story, boys and girls, is that you should eat a healthy balanced diet of everything, without over eating, and if you choose to take one thing or another out of your diet then please! Please when asked about it just say &#8220;I do it because I choose to&#8221; not because you are saving the world or feel bad for the cows. And lastly please don&#8217;t believe everything you&#8217;re told. Like, although humans are designed to farm and the earth is designed to be farmed, we couldn&#8217;t possibly, no way, no how, survive just like we have since humans first stepped onto this earth by farming. From now on, try to look into things a little bit more. I think someone above said it; RESEARCH! Do your research and you&#8217;ll make better decisions.</p>

										<p>Brian,</p>
<p>To address many of the things in your post would just be repeating myself. I do appreciate your opinion and respect your right to it, just as I hope you respect mine. </p>
<p>As living beings I believe that animals deserve more consideration than produce. You seem to disagree. If you can really look at a head of lettuce and then look into a little piglet&#8217;s eyes and believe that both are equal and deserve the same level of care, I don&#8217;t know how to convince you otherwise and I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;re can not convince me that they are equal. On this, let&#8217;s agree to disagree. </p>
<p>I have done a lot of research. More than that, part of my job is working with abused and neglected animals. You say that I should &#8220;just say “I do it because I choose to.&#8221; I did that. Then I chose to give a reason for that choice. I&#8217;m not asking you to agree with my choice or appreciate my reasoning. </p>
<p>I know that farmers who aren&#8217;t and don&#8217;t work for huge corporations are suffering. In my area that is in large part due to more and more people giving up cigarettes. But there are also good families who raise edible crops and livestock. They use the pesticides they have to and the fertilizer they need to. And they should. They treat their animals well and give them all the room they need to explore and graze. I respect them and I choose to partake of their crops and let others, who will fill over half their plate with barbecue and the other half with grilled chicken have the meat. That is my choice. I don&#8217;t understand why it matters to you or why you want me to eat the meat. </p>
<p>One thing my research has taught me is that, yes, there needs to be more humane farmers. It also told me that even if humane farmers increased there is not enough land, workers, feed, grass, etc&#8230; to humanely sustain the amount of livestock it would take to feed Americans as much meat as the majority of Americans want to eat. I am not saying you eat too much meat or that any person here eats too much meat. I don&#8217;t know your diets. I&#8217;m just statistically talking about most Americans. </p>
<p>A few points to clarify and to make sure I have not misrepresented myself:<br />
* I don&#8217;t eat livestock or dairy. I don&#8217;t eat eggs unless I know for sure they are really from free-range, free-roaming hens. I do eat fish. I am not vegetarian. I was vegan for awhile and found that my health suffered. I don&#8217;t disagree that we need a varied diet that includes animal protein. I just carefully choose what I want that animal protein to be. </p>
<p>* I do buy some of my vegetables from grocery stores. I agree that it would be better for me to shop exclusively at farmers&#8217; markets. I am working toward only supporting sustainable farms.  </p>
<p>* I think it&#8217;s fine that you eat meat in moderation, especially if that meat is from farmers in your area (I think you said it was.). We actually seem to agree on many of the things we&#8217;re talking about here. We are working with the same information and believe similar things. We&#8217;ve just done slightly different things with that information. I chose to give up livestock meat completely, you chose to balance your diet with less meat than the average American. The only real disagreement I see is that you believe produce needs to be treated humanely for their own sake and that they shouldn&#8217;t be treated with pesticides to keep insects from ruining them and they should not be fertilized with manure. I believe that local farmers should be supported, but I don&#8217;t believe that tomatoes have feelings. </p>
<p>* I am not perfect. I do what I think is right to the best of my ability. The validity of what I believe is not contingent on how perfectly I uphold it. I should buy more produce from local farmers. Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t eat fish &#8211; I don&#8217; know about that one though. I do what I can, just like we all do and while I appreciate your opinion, I don&#8217;t appreciate the condescending, combative way your express it. But I will concede that voice tone and attitude is often hard to discern in written communication, so my interpretation may not be correct and if it is not, I apologize. </p>

										<p>One more thing to clarify:<br />
I don&#8217;t think that people who raise tobacco are bad people. Reading back and see that it sounds like that, but that&#8217;s not what I meant at all.</p>

										<p>Just to clarify, I don&#8217;t care what kind of decisions anybody else makes. I can not control how people think and I don&#8217;t dwell on it. If you don&#8217;t eat meat, that is great.<br />
No, I do not believe that produce have feelings (that&#8217;s just silly). Just like I don&#8217;t believe that cows or little piglets have feelings. You see, feelings are purely a human thing. In order to feel them you have to have a concept time, which means you have to be able to think about the past or future so that you may compare the present situation with whatever situation you once were in or hope to be in. This is something that only humans do and because we do it, we assume that everything does it. Animals live in the moment, it&#8217;s all they have and all they will ever have. They don&#8217;t huddle together at night and cry to each other about there living conditions because they don&#8217;t know any different. I do believe that they feel  the stress of the conditions that are subject to, just as produce does, which effects the quality of the product. For example; the fat in grass fed beef has recently been found to actually be healthy for you, where as the corn, grain fed, stressed out beef is completely unhealthy for you. The same is true for all products farmed, not farmed properly you lose flavour, nutrients, and antioxidants. Even more dangerous is the use if the wrong types of pesticides and manure. Do you know that a vast majority of produce is fertilized with manure from corn fed cows which is riddled with salmonella and is then passed right on to the produce itself. This is what I mean when I talk about produce not being farmed properly, not that their feelings are hurt.<br />
  Also, the FDA likes to allow people to think that it would be impossible for us to live off natural farms and that we need these super farms to survive and listen I could write all day about this but lets try to sum it up. One company sells a product that everybody buys, they cut the cost which in turn makes the product cheaper. Yay! But at the same time, takes the product from being healthy to being extremely unhealthy, but who cares? It&#8217;s cheap, right. Next people get unhealthy and obese and they need six different medications to stay alive. And then the crazy part; the same companies owns shares in both the food industry and the drug industry. Wow! Talk about burning the candle at both ends. Once their methods are exposed and people decide that they are no longer going to support these monsters, then comes the &#8220;studies&#8221;. We can&#8217;t grow our own crops, and raise our own beef that would ruin the earth(that was sarcasm).<br />
  Yes, we do seem to agree on many things, including disagreeing. But I believe that you have missed most of my points from you earlier post. However, it has been a pleasure conversing the subject with you. If you have any questions on the subject feel free to ask.</p>

This is an abstract from the 2008 SOFIA report <a href="http://www.wri.org/publication/content/8384" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','www.wri.org']);" rel="nofollow">http://www.wri.org/publication/content/8384</a> There will be a new report for 2010.</p>
<p>One more &#8211; Harvard Public School of Health &#8211; which is pretty reputable &#8211; gives very little place to meat and animal products in a healthy diet  <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/pyramid/index.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','www.hsph.harvard.edu']);" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/pyramid/index.html</a>  and what they have to say on protein <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein-full-story/index.html#protein_package" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','www.hsph.harvard.edu']);" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein-full-story/index.html#protein_package</a></p>
<p>I have been a vegetarian most of my life because I don&#8217;t want to eat animals (also very healthy). One way to look at it is that I am carbon offset for another 3 or 4 moderate meat eaters. So it would actually make sense for meat eaters to encourage vegetarianism.</p>

										<p>Also just discovered that the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans was released on June 15th.  <a href="http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DGAs2010-DGACReport.htm" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','www.cnpp.usda.gov']);" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DGAs2010-DGACReport.htm</a> </p>
<p>I have read reports from those involved in putting together the guidelines that it was an amazing struggle between food scientist, nutritionists and lobby groups. </p>
<p>It starts off with &#8221; The 2010 DGAC Report is distinctly different from previous reports in several ways. First, it addresses an American public of whom the majority are overweight or obese and yet under-nourished in several key nutrients&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is what the 2010 guidelines recommend &#8211; </p>
<p>Shift food intake patterns to a more plant-based diet that emphasizes vegetables, cooked dry beans and peas, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. In addition, increase the intake of seafood and fat-free and low-fat milk and milk products and consume only moderate amounts of lean meats, poultry, and eggs.</p>
<p>These guidelines have a big impact as they underlie school lunch programs and all sorts of other government related food services.</p>

										<p>Plants appear not to have the physiology to feel pain. If you are concerned about plants being eaten though, a plant-based diet will help reduce harm to other plants, as fewer will die based on that diet.Fewer forests will be cut down to make room for growing grain that will be given to animals as feed etc. As for variety, a vegan diet often includes lots of things that you would not see in a traditional western diet. For example, teff flour, nutritional yeast, sea vegetables, wide variety of nuts, beans, seeds and often a much wider variety of vegetables and fruits. I like lots of spicy and flavorful foods and find a vegan diet accommodates this very well.</p>

										<p>Tofu is bad because it&#8217;s highly processed? Er, we&#8217;re not talking TVP here, tofu is minimally processed and is usually purchased w/o a preservative. True, calcium sulfate or magnesium chloride is used to coagulate the curds from the soy milk, but they&#8217;re not toxic.</p>
<p>Now you might make a case for phytoestrogens and  the mental health of people over 60 eating a lot of tofu&#8230;.but that&#8217;s not what you said.</p>

										<p>Take a look at the animal kingdom and tell me if you think any other animal, particularly primates, care about the humane conditions of their protein sources. Then, recognize that without an increased consumption of meat by our hominid ancestors we would not be the highly functioning creatures we are today.</p>

										<p>I&#8217;m a vegetarian, and I love animals, but honestly, I think the important thing here is that the inhumane conditions breed sickness and disease which, in turn, impacts what we ingest. At one time (say, back in the caveman era to pick on someone else&#8217;s comment), animals could be killed and eaten naturally. There is very little that is natural about how our meat is processed these days&#8230;with the exception of those raised organically and free range, and we can still run into problems there. Everything is manufactured now and generally robbed of key nutrients. Animals are fed things they can&#8217;t digest, and their systems back up on them. Large companies and factories produce and handle our food products, which leads to contamination&#8230;E. coli in spinach, anyone? This is one of the main reasons why we have so many health issues in the States. Go see Food, Inc. It will change the way you think about meat consumption, not to mention just about everything else you put in your body.</p>

										<p>Why do you think there is such a problem with mad cow disease the problem lies in the conditions of the animals within the factory farming industry. The same goes for the industries that mass produce veggies, there is a problem with cross contamination not washing and poor regulation.</p>

										<p>hi.. i just found this website and firstly, want to thank everyone for being so smart and awesome. I&#8217;m vegan for the most part, exceptions on DHA enhanced local farm free happy chicken eggs. <img src='http://cdn.marksdailyapple.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' />  this stated.. i recognize and am continually rethinking and researching debates and facts on nutritional guidelines, with optimal health (while standing by my beliefs,) of *key importance.</p>
<p>i want to say that.. as a vegan, i am not by any means trying to challenge this fact that animal flesh is incredibly nutrient dense and complete, as well as, totally normal/natural as part of a human diet. really i agree, personally, with these facts.</p>
<p>my staying away from (for the mostpart) animal products, is entirely to do with personal relation, understanding and empathy for all living beings, including my own, and simply doing the most i can do to participate in a positive free and enjoyable trip for everyone here. vegetables of course also included. <img src='http://cdn.marksdailyapple.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>there are so many incredibly messed up things going on in this place right now, i realize there&#8217;s only so much i can do; but i&#8217;m fine with that.. and prefer to always be doing simply the best that i can.</p>
<p>also wanted to state that.. even though i couldn&#8217;t personally take an animal&#8217;s life, (personal reasons/issues and whatnot), i respect hunting (for need, rather than, obviously, sport,) fully well; in fact could probably say that i am an advocate; considering my true issue lying in the hands of the insane corporate drama madness. </p>
<p>power to ya.</p>
<p>anyways. just wanted to state those points. in case maybe some of these fellow animal-product bypassers feel similarly. </p>
<p>or maybe i just wanted to stand up.<br />
lol</p>
<p>anyway thanks guys.<br />
hope you all sit with incredibly happy, peaceful dreams and lives. <img src='http://cdn.marksdailyapple.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

										<p>Personally, my family buys our beef directly from a farm where the animals live long and healthy lives before becoming food.  Another option would be eating at Chipotle (they use naturally raised meat without all the added chemicals and growth horomones)&#8230; It&#8217;s an good option if you eat meat or choose not to eat meat due to cruel treatment of animals.</p>

Only support local farmer&#8217;s who have done things right for many generations and actually need our support.</p>

										<p>You don&#8217;t fear saturated fat? I&#8217;d like to know why, because saturated fat is bad fat &#8211; solid at room temperature, the kind you cut of the edges of meat and such. The good kind of fat is unsaturated &#8211; liquid at room temperature.</p>

										<p>You obviously haven&#8217;t read anything on this site. Saturated fat is good. If it&#8217;s solid at room temperature, provided it&#8217;s not hydrogenated, It is resistant to rancidity. Polyunsaturated fats are bad as they actually oxidize in the bloodstream and become rancid- in your system.</p>

										<p>Most of you are picking nits. I am an expert, ask my ex. </p>
<p>Geoff, you come close to an interesting idea. I imagine a time when being a civilized human meant cooking some things sometimes. The animals eaten back then probably were most often gutted and eaten with minimal preparation. </p>
<p>Hunger, fear of getting eaten or killed yourself and a different set of priorities are what my caveman instincts are telling me. </p>
<p>I am also willing to bet almost everything (Geoff said fish) would be healthier if eaten with almost everything &#8216;as is&#8217;. Animals eaten whole with just their last meals removed sound like the kind of meal we were made to eat. Almost everything living is hungry or literally starving all the time. Do herbivores only eat the tastiest parts and spit out everything else? Not the ones I have seen. </p>
<p>Being mostly vegetarian would make sense back when fire meant civilized. A plant is easier to catch than an animal. It just makes sense to me that humans need a diet that was the easiest to get for all these generations.</p>
<p>I do not think God(s) or evolution intended for us to eat at McDonald&#8217;s. Ronald gets all the hate mail but all &#8216;fast foods&#8217; are no longer an asset when we do not have to run to stay alive.</p>

										<p>Oop, forgot to mention; Paul said &#8220;a genuinely cruelty free form of dairy&#8221;,</p>
<p>Go to small, local dairies. Tell them what you want &#8211; milk from humanely treated milk cows and ask who in the area runs that kind of farm. Then ask for a tour when they next (no time to hide the truth) milk the cows. The small operation farmers you want will probably love the attention, be eager for cash, love showing off and worry about you claiming you got hurt by the &#8216;raw&#8217; milk.</p>

										<p>I was vegetarian (in fact mostly vegan) for about ten years because I loved animals&#8230; but my health suffered badly.  Now I&#8217;ll eat free range, organic beef/chicken/eggs etc., and wild caught fish.  Also organic raw cheese/milk/Balkan yogurt.</p>
<p>It took me a long time to be able to do it, but really my whole attitude towards life and human beings has changed.  I still hate factory farms and any sort of animal cruelty with a passion and won&#8217;t contribute to it knowingly in any way, but I don&#8217;t feel alienated from my own body anymore.  A lot of vegans and vegetarians seem to think that humans are not really animals, and that eating other animals at any time is morally abhorrent and &#8220;evil&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think most people do a heck of lot better with a bit of animal protein and fat at least a few times a week, though.  Your body cries out for animal fat, even if you ignore it.</p>
<p>P.S. Just watched that documentary &#8220;Fat Head&#8221;&#8230; I still loathe fast food restaurants, but it was awesome.</p>

										<p>Hi,  I am with you on that one.  I pretty much created an eating disorder for myself trying to be vegetarian.  If I couldn&#8217;t find what I wanted to eat, I just didn&#8217;t eat at all.  I think I lived off of sugar and grains because the vegetables became a pain, and I couldn&#8217;t get organic like I wanted, and now I am treating myself for candida&#8230;and guess what that entails?  Eating clean meat!</p>

Forcing them to reproduce at the whims of some farmer every year only to be raised in crowded, inhumane conditions until finally they are murdered to feed the unquenchable hunger of these vegan beasts that have decided that they must have plants and only plants.
