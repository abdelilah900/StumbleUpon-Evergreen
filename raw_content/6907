          <p> Food  is the #1 least recycled of all waste materials. There is just no easy way to recycle food - until now! Our society recycles more and more paper and plastic each year, which shows our  potential once a technology is in place to make things easier. <br />
          </p>
          <p> <br />
            <span class="textTopic">The Biodegradable Irony</span> <br />
          </p>
          <p> Food  decomposes by itself in nature.&nbsp; However, it is one of the largest components in landfills, accounting for nearly 50% of all municipal solid waste.&nbsp; There is more food in landfills than diapers, styrofoam, and tires &#8212; combined.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p> Landfills are layered deep and saturated with water.&nbsp; No oxygen can penetrate.&nbsp; As a result, even &quot;biodegradable&quot; waste will remain embalmed for centuries to come. &nbsp; Landfills produce methane, a harmful greenhouse gas <span style="font-weight: bold;">21 times more potent than carbon dioxide</span> (according to the US EPA), and leach toxic chemicals into our air and drinking water.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p> On a more urgent note, we are running out of landfill space&#8212;that is, open space reasonably close to population centers.&nbsp; Stories abound of trash barges with no place to dock, ocean dumping, and trash exported to poorer countries.&nbsp; Landfill costs are skyrocketing, which means higher fees (or taxes) for everyone.&nbsp; The organic nutrients present in food and paper waste are removed from the food chain, requiring gardeners and farmers to instead rely on chemical fertilizers to replenish their soil.&nbsp; National and local governments around the world are enacting regulations to limit trash and increase recycling.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p> <span class="textTopic"> <br />
            Cultures at work</span> <br />
          </p>
          <p> Microscopic compost cultures, which are present everywhere in nature, eat away at organic waste material.&nbsp; Most of the material is converted into water vapor, which evaporates away. &nbsp; Roughly 25% of the material remains in a highly nutrient rich form which re-enters the food chain as a natural organic fertilizer called compost.&nbsp; Of particular value is nitrogen, which is difficult for plants to obtain in a usable form.&nbsp; Compost is also very useful for retaining moisture due to its spongy, fibrous texture.&nbsp; The most important requirement for compost cultures is oxygen - without it they can not survive.&nbsp; <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <p> <span class="textTopic">Spread composting and grass-cycling </span> <br />
          </p>
          <p> Left to itself out in the open with oxygen, compost cultures break down organic matter into fertile soil.&nbsp; In the most primitive form of home composting, simply spread waste out and eventually it will go back to nature.&nbsp; In a process called &quot;grass cycling,&quot; just leave grass clippings right there on the lawn rather than collecting them in a bag.&nbsp; They will dry out in a few days and will be hardly noticeable.&nbsp; The process takes a year or more, however, and some organic wastes will attract pets, children, rats, and raccoons.&nbsp; It's fine for grass clippings but not for kitchen compost.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p> <img src="images/earth_organic_compost.jpg" alt="compost worms" width="224" height="144" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="left" /><span class="textTopic"> <br />
            Backyard composting</span> <br />
          </p>
          <p> You can accelerate and partially contain the home composting process by building a heap,  compost bin, or compost tumbler.&nbsp; Compost cultures, already present in most foods or added from a starter pack, eat away at the waste material and produce heat as a byproduct.&nbsp; If the material is piled high enough, heat is trapped inside and can raise temperatures significantly.&nbsp; The heat allows the cultures to work faster and reproduce faster to increase their population, which in turn reduces composting time to a few months or weeks.&nbsp; You can build a home compost heap with just a pitch fork, or use any one of a number of inexpensive or home made compost bins and compost tumblers and tools to keep things organized.&nbsp; Many garden centers sell compost bins and compost tumblers and offer courses on how to compost in your backyard.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p> But backyard composting has drawbacks.&nbsp; The heap must be at least three feet (one meter) high to generate sufficient heat.&nbsp; A typical compost bin or compost tumbler is not  big enough and so sufficient heat is never achieved. And if it is too big, oxygen will not penetrate.&nbsp; The compost must be turned periodically so the cold outer layer has a chance to get inside where it is warm.&nbsp; This is backbreaking and dirty work.&nbsp; Moisture level, acidity, and the carbon to nitrogen ratio must be carefully managed.&nbsp; In most climates, winter temperatures destroy the compost cultures.&nbsp; Most compost bins and compost tumblers are not attractive.&nbsp; Certain foods wastes such as meat, fish, and dairy products, have obvious health hazards and are not suitable for a home composting.&nbsp; You may be surprised to find seeds from a single discarded tomato or apple germinating all over your garden.&nbsp; Besides, not everyone has space for a compost heap. It is the same thing for worm composting and using a worm compost bin, which will be explained in better detail later on.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p><br />
            <span class="textTopic">Municipal Composting</span> <br />
            <br />
            Some towns and cities have begun programs to make compost on a massive scale.&nbsp; Food, paper, and yard waste are collected from homes and restaurants, and hauled to a large field.&nbsp; The material is sorted, shredded, and arranged in long rows, called windrows.&nbsp; Each windrow is ten feet high and hundreds of feet long. Industrial fans and ducts blow air through the material to improve oxygen flow.&nbsp; In some cases, windrows are covered with a plastic sheet to contain moisture and reduce odors.&nbsp; Specialized tractors turn the material periodically. <br />
          </p>
          <p> A chemist monitors temperature, moisture level, and other indicators to ensure safe and effective composting.&nbsp; Temperatures inside are so hot that they actually sterilize the compost and render even meat, fish, and dairy products safe for handling.&nbsp; The finished product is often very valuable, and can be sold to the agricultural industry to offset the cost of running the facility.&nbsp; Making composting is very cost effective when compared to landfills.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p> Windrow composting has drawbacks, namely storing, collecting, hauling, and processing of all that rotting kitchen compost material.&nbsp; Rats, raccoons, flies, fluid dripping, and odors can be hazardous at collection points as well as on route to the composting facility.&nbsp; In most cases, an additional fleet of diesel trucks, with all their dirty emissions, is required.&nbsp; The air ducts and plastic covers are usually discarded after just one or two uses, thus contributing to landfills.&nbsp; Initial startup expenses can be prohibitive.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p> <br />
            <span class="textTopic">In-vessel systems</span> <br />
          </p>
          <p> For years, hotels, schools, food processing plants, prisons, and other large institutions have used industrial  machines to make compost and reduce waste hauling fees.&nbsp; The machines are essentially big tanks with lots of heavy duty mixing and pumping equipment.&nbsp; The compost is fully contained, such that fluid drippings, flies, and odors are eliminated or otherwise disposed of.&nbsp; High temperatures can be reached quickly and reliably to render meat, fish, and dairy products safe for handling.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p> But there is a downside.&nbsp; The investment is typically tens of thousands of dollars, and requires a great deal of space with special sewer and electrical hookups.&nbsp; A dedicated, trained, and experienced staff must operate and maintain the equipment.&nbsp; Depending on location, odors can be a problem.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p> <br />
            <span class="textTopic">Worm composting</span> <br />
          </p>
          <p> Another approach is to let worms eat your trash, in a process called &quot;vermi-composting.&quot; Worms will eat almost any kitchen compost, produce little odor, take up little space, and they work fast.&nbsp; A variety of inexpensive or home made bins contain the worms and wastes such that you can add more waste and remove the finished product in a convenient way.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p> The disadvantages of worm composting are many.&nbsp; The worms don't sterilize the material with high temperature, so meat, fish, and dairy products are not safe for worm composting, and germination of seeds may occur.&nbsp; Some people encounter smells and excessive fluid drippings, depending on the type of kitchen compost used.&nbsp; And of course, there is always the fear of worms getting loose&#8212;whether from the quest for more food, or inadvertent encounters with children or pets.&nbsp; For some, the very idea of squirmy little critters is simply not acceptable.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p> <br />
            <span class="textTopic">NatureMill&#8212;a home solution</span> <br />

          <p> <img src="images/earth_compost_kitchen.jpg" alt="Compost kitchen" width="148" height="249" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="left" />NatureMill brings home composting to the mainstream user.&nbsp; It is essentially a miniature in-vessel kitchen composting system.&nbsp; NatureMill delivers an answer to the problem of space and labor for both traditional composting. It is a great upgrade from an ordinary compost tumbler or worm compost bin.&nbsp;  Waste is collected right where it is generated&#8212;in the kitchen.&nbsp; A computer controls the temperature, air flow, moisture, and mixing to accelerate the process and eliminate the backbreaking work.&nbsp; Everything is fully self contained in a modern, attractive container.&nbsp; Just a few square feet of floor space is required.&nbsp; No special plumbing or electrical connections are needed, other than a standard electrical outlet.&nbsp; There is no need to handle and transport the rotting material.&nbsp; <br />
          </p>
          <p> Best of all, NatureMill provides home gardeners with a source of rich, organic compost.&nbsp; And there is something uniquely satisfying about witnessing the entire food chain: from the garden, to the dining table, and back to the garden again.&nbsp; <br />
