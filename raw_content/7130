This recipe comes from my local butcher in Le Rayol-Canadel. In France your butcher sells much more than just raw meat and the Peyrelard’s have an exquisite variety of terrines, patés and prepared dishes such as pissaladier, quiche and stuffed courgettes.</div>

Inspired by Elizabeth David’s gâteux au chocolat, in her classic cookbook French Provincial Cooking, the cake is enhanced with a traditional Aztec hint of chilli. This cake is a classic on its own and can certainly be made without the chilli powder.</div>

Simple and refreshing this salad is a great accompaniment to any meat or poultry dish. The fresh citrus flavour also works as a foil to fatty or rich dishes. It’s a great addition to a cook's repertoire ... </div>

Jared refers to this recipe as “how to roast a duck and have time for your wife” making it the perfect option for a special romantic dinner. He suggests that it would be wonderful cooked in a coal- or wood-fired barbecue – which is how I cooked it...</div>

These pizzas are amazing!! It will make you think twice about ever ordering in again. The base is crisp and not too doughy. The real treat is you can add whatever vegetables and toppings you want, I have recorded a couple of Jamie’s favourites ...</div>

The flavour in this tomato broth is an exquisite accompaniment to the fresh, plump mussels. Cleaning and debearding aside, this recipe is all over in 5 minutes. Serve immediately with some well-buttered toast – it’s hard to go wrong.</div>

Re-named frumpets by the lovely Blocka, this ingenious dish is a little left of centre - but those who stick to the recipe will be rewarded. The chilli adds kick, the maple syrup brings sweetness and the bacon provides the smoky saltiness ...</div>

I was recently presented with the opportunity to purchase half a spring lamb. I couldn’t resist, yet found myself stumped when it came to the breast. I have now discovered when slowly cooked, the lamb’s breast is a cut somewhat akin to pork belly ...</div>

This salad is a classic and a meal in itself. Hopkinson does not include tuna, however a lightly seared tuna steak would be a lovely addition if you are hungry. Opt for the best anchovies - it makes all the difference...</div>
