	href="http://cookingforengineers.com/article.php?id=3">first Bacon Cooking Test</a> (October 2004), I knew that I would have to continue to test different ways to cook bacon. I was so sure that a second article would follow that I named labeled that first article as "Part I". Over half a year later, I've finally gotten around to writing up my latest experiments with cooking bacon.<span class="fullpost"><?if($fullpost==1){?><br />
<br />
I look at three more techniques in this article (using a fourth cooking method, low heat pan frying, as a control): Microwaving with a Makin' Bacon dish, grilling, and slow baking.<br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4624_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4624_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='294' class='left' alt='' /></a>
<b>Method 1: Microwaving with a Makin' Bacon dish</b><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br />
There are many specialty dishes designed for microwaving bacon. Some are simply plastic plates with grooves cut in them to catch grease. This one, <a href="http://www.makinbacon.com">the Makin' Bacon dish</a> (about $10), elevates the bacon on poles. As many as a eighteen strips of bacon (according to the manufacturer), can be cooked at a time on this apparatus (although I think my bacon must be wider than their bacon because only a dozen of my strips would fit).<br />
<br />
Since I was only going to be cooking a couple strips, I used only the center pole.<br />
<?}?></span><br /><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4625_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4625_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='218'></a><span class="fullpost"><?if($fullpost==1){?><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4626_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4626_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='263' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Following the instructions on the Makin' Bacon box, I covered the bacon with a paper towel to reduce potential splatter.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4628_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4628_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='217' class='left' alt='' /></a>
I then microwaved it on high for 90 seconds. The bacon at the top (where it bends over the beam, was thoroughly cooked (almost overcooked). However, some of the fatty parts were still soft and partially unrendered. The texture of the bacon was thick and crunchy (similar to the microwaved bacon from the first test). There was also a slight off flavor to the bacon indicative of heating the bacon to too high of a temperature. It is definitely a very fast way to cook and with the Makin Bacon dish, a reasonable number of pieces can be cooked at the same time.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br />
<br />
As advertised, the bacon grease dripped down into the plastic container. The instructions recommend pouring out the bacon grease but why waste a good thing? After the grease cools, simply spoon it out into a storage container and store in the refrigerator. The grease collected was fairly clean with some small pieces of bacon in it.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2: Grilling</b><br />
I prepared a grill with low heat (about 300-350 degrees) and laid out the bacon onto the cooking surface.<br /><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4631_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4631_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='176'></a><br /><br /><div style='clear:left'></div><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4633_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4633_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='295' class='left' alt='' /></a>
Flipping the bacon every five minutes, they reached doneness in twenty minutes time.<br /><div style='clear:left'></div><br />
<br />
With this method, the meaty portions were chewy (but not overly so) while the fat was light and crisp. There were also no off flavors to the bacon. Because of the texture and flavor, this was Tina's favorite cooking method.<br />
<br />
Because the bacon grease dripped down into the grill, there was no grease to collect and save afterward; there was also no clean up required. Depending on the size of your grill, you can cook a great deal of bacon at once.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 3: Baking at low temperatures</b><br />
I seemed to have lost the pictures that accompanied this baking technique - but their not much to look at anyway, it's just an oven.<br />
<br />
I laid out strips of bacon onto a wire rack and positioned a wire rack on a foil  lined half sheet pan. I placed the pan in an oven preheated to 200&#176;F (93&#176;C) and waited. The theory was that the low heat would penetrate the bacon slowly and as the bacon cooked the fat would render, but without increasing the bacon temperature to a level where the preserving agents of cured meat begin to react and form new compounds producing an off taste (and potentially carcinogenic substances - but more chemicals such as ascorbic acid  or erythorbic acid are added these days to help mitigate these effects).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I do not know how long the bacon was in the oven because I forgot to look at the time and fell asleep. My best estimate is that the bacon baked for about 3 hours.<br />
<br />
The baking resulted in extremely straight pieces of bacon that I found to have exceptional taste and flavor as compared to the pan frying and grilling (the microwaved bacon's off taste was really apparent next to the baked bacon). The texture was crispy throughout. Since flavor and texture were great, this is my favorite cooking method. (Tina prefers a little chewier meat and still likes the grilled method the best.)<br />
<br />
The long cooking time means this method is best for cooking bacon in large quantities (multiple pans) and then bagging and refrigerating them for future use. The bacon grease collected from the half sheet pan was pure white and completely devoid of charred bits.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 4: Pan frying</b><br />
As a control, I cooked the bacon in the same way as the "winning" method from the <a href="http://cookingforengineers.com/article.php?id=3">first bacon test</a> - pan frying. I placed three strips of bacon in a cold pan and placed it over low heat.<br /><a href='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/640/DSC_4632_crop.jpg'><img border='0'  src='http://www.cookingforengineers.com/pics/320/DSC_4632_crop.jpg'  width='320' height='159'></a><br />
<br />
After fifteen minutes of cooking while turning the bacon occasionally, the bacon was done. The bacon was light and crispy with a little chewiness to the meat. The grilled method's results came closest to this bacon. The bacon grease remaining in the pan had a pale gray-brown color and was spotted with charred bits and pieces of bacon.<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusions</b><br />
If you're in a rush, microwaving works - but for the best flavor and texture either grill or bake (in advance). If you own a propane grill, cooking bacon over the grill is easier and more convenient than doing it on a stove top. However, if you don't mind spending the time, baking produces the best results with pure bacon grease for use later (may I suggest <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article.php?id=112">clam chowder</a>?).<br />

					<div class="commentbody">Cooking bacon, or any fatty food like duck breast for example, requires a slightly differant treatment than most meats. It's best to start by placing the meat, fat side down, in a cold and dry pan. Then the stove is turned to high until the fat begins to sizzle. At this point the heat is turned to medium high until done. This approach allows the fat to gradually render, producing a superior product.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">re: Australian bacon?<br />
<br />
I'm not familiar with the bacon that is sold/served in Australia. American bacon is cut from the belly, cured or smoked. The fat content is about 50% (eye-balling it, not actually measured). Generally streaks and clumps of meat are surrounded by ample areas of fats.<br />
<br />
Canadian bacon is cut from the loin and in comparison is not fatty at all. It has a different texture and taste (almost like ham) when compared to American bacon.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the bacon sold in Australia is like Canadian bacon?</div>

A B says put your bacon in a cold oven and pre heat to 400 i leave it in about 12 minutes and i'v tired most of the other methods and find this to be successful for flavor plus i even just use my toaster oven if all i want is a little and ajust the time to suit your tastes</div>

The bacon melts (as it does in the oven) as it cooks; there is no sizzling. The process takes at least two hours and requires minimal attention. As the bacon finishes, whip up some pancake batter and keep the bacon warm in a slow oven while the pancakes cook.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">The gadget may work better with a full rack than with just two strips. The additional strips would absorb more of the energy. The bacon would cook much slower. It works the same when cooking bacon in paper towels in the microwave. I have found that some bacon cooks much faster. There are differences from one package to another, and with the age of the bacon. The rack should make it easy to tell when it is done the way you like it.<br />
Since this is an engineers cooking site, I will suggest another approach: Connect a clip to each end of a strip and measure its resistance. As the moisture leaves, resistance should increase. This could be used to make an automatic slow cooker, using a large light bulb for heat in an insulated box. Unless you use stainless steel clips, you would sacrifice one strip.<br />
There was a device sold in the 70's that heated a hot dog by inserting sharp metal points into it and running straight house current through it for about a minute. It tasted awful, and there was no browning. Slow oven cooking creates taste.</div>

That may be true for 3 strips, but if you cook a full package, the grease will build up in the bottom of your grill and eventually run out the bottom (if you gave a gas grill)...  theres supposed to be a little bucket to collect this (comes with most grill kits) but I dont know many guys who bothered to put it on. <br />
<br />
I dont cook much with charcoal, but I suspect that the grease would end up mixing with the ash and make for a fun cleaning job as well.<br />

					<div class="commentsubject">Subject: <span>Bacon on a George Foreman grill</span><br /></div>
					<div class="commentbody">I have an imitation George Foreman (iGF) grill (it has most of the<br />
same features, just not the brand name or price tag) and I recently tried<br />
cooking some bacon on it.<br />
<br />
The result was probably the best bacon I've ever cooked.<br />
Thats not really saying a lot. After reading this article I learned that<br />
I've probably been doing it wrong all these years. (cooking it over too<br />
high heat )<br />
<br />
I did two batches of bacon on my iGF.<br />
The first batch I started with the grill cold. I layed out as many slices<br />
as I could fit comfortably. Then I closed the lid and plugged it in.<br />
I started checking it for done-ness by eyeball after about 4 minutes.<br />
By 5 or 6 minutes total cooking time, the bacon was done.<br />
<br />
For the second batch I just put more raw bacon on the already hot iGF.<br />
The cooking time was reduced a bit. Other than that, the results were<br />
pretty much the same.<br />
<br />
The bacon came out wonderfully tender crispy (personally I can't stand<br />
chewy bacon) without being over cooked. Since it's constrained by the<br />
grill while cooking it comes out nicely flat. Due to the nature of the<br />
grill, the grease drains away while cooking so the bacon isn't greasy.<br />
Lastly, since the system is closed while cooking, there is little<br />
opportunity for splatter.<br />
<br />
On my particular grill, cleanup is a Pain In The Posterior. It doesn't<br />
disassemble at all. Being an electric appliance I can't just toss it into<br />
a sink of hot water. There are other, more expensive, models with<br />
removable cooking surfaces which are dishwasher safe.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'd say using an electric clamshell style grill to cook bacon<br />
works very well. I wouldn't recommend running out to buy one JUST<br />
to cook bacon. If you do run out to buy one, choose wisely. Consider cleanup.</div>

					<div class="commentsubject">Subject: <span>The Kentuckians way to cook bacon</span><br /></div>
					<div class="commentbody">First you gotta have good bacon. Not the watery mess sold in the grocery stores these days. You want real hickory cured bacon that has had salt rubbed in it to cure it. <br />
<br />
Now this is mighty hard to come by these days so you may have to find some farmers or backcountry smokehouse folks who will sell it to you. My favorite was in the next town over and they would take me into the smoking rooms and open a door to a smoker. There would be a small pile of hickory sawdust smoldering on the floor and hanging above were many slabs of sow belly. <br />
<br />
I would ask the curing man to pull me down one he thought was best and he generally would get me a nice on. I never had it sliced by them but just took the whole slad wrapped in paper home. It was strong enough that the whole pickup would smell like hickory smoke. <br />
<br />
Now to cook it. I would take a real real sharp butcher knife and cut a slice bout 1/8 inch thick or maybe a bit thicker. You never never want thin bacon.  I would either cut on thru the rind (outer skin) , then slice that off later or fillet about 2 inches with the flat of the knife along the top of the rind. <br />
<br />
Next goes some pure lard into the 8 or 9 inch cast iron skillet. This skillet must NEVER be touched by women's hands. They will ruin it with soap and remove the seasoning. Never let them touch it and it will never stick, long as you clean it right afterwards. <br />
<br />
Bring the lard up to heat and put the bacon in the pan. If your temperature is just right and enough lard(to just cover the bacon) it will never pop or splatter and also because all the liquid in it has been cured out!!<br />
<br />
This bacon will not shrink either. What goes in the skillet is the same size as what comes out. You then look for when the fat parts of the bacon tend to get done. Its a judgement call anyway and you will learn. You then put it on a platter on top of some folded paper towels and then another to pat the top. This removes the extra grease and results in a certain brittleness. No chewieness. Don't want that. I like mine to be at the point where I can snap it in two. Not burned either. Just right is what I want. <br />
<br />
You will also notice that with this good bacon that there will be NOTHING sticking to the bottom of the skillet. What that is with normal bacon is the carbon from the sugar burning. You don't want that either. No sugar cured bacon. No sir. <br />
<br />
Now the hard part. No a lot of folks can eat this type of old fashioned bacon. It may be a bit too salty for them or too smoky. But once you get to like it you won't be able to live without it. City bacon will just not work for you anymore. <br />
<br />
Now with the bacon grease in the skillet you can do many things. You never dispose of it. You first can fry you some eggs. Over easy or sunnyside up. Let the grease cool down a bit. Use a spoon or metal spatula to flip grease onto the top of the egg and it will cook perfectly. Put it on a plate and pat with a paper towel then pepper it. <br />
<br />
The leftover bacon drippings(grease) can be used to season a lot of vegetables or to make cornbread with(also in the skillet). You can season turnip greens with it or collards or whatever. Green beans too. You can also put it in a qt. mason jar and save it in the icebox. <br />
<br />
BTW making good cornbread is a lost art. Its  getting just the right amount in the skillet, no sugar and no flour. Just bacon drippings, Martha White cornmeal(white only) and one egg and some milk. Got to have just the right amount of milk. When baked if too thick won't taste right nor if too thin. Let it bake a tad too long and its coarse. Get everything just exactly right and you will eat the whole pan full. Save some to crumble in a glass of buttermilk with salt and pepper on the top. Heaven. I mean heaven. <br />
<br />
I can cook up a pot of white beans with a ham shank and a pan of cornbread and some fried potatoes and I am back on the farm. Well I still live on the farm but you know what I mean. <br />
<br />
Round here if you go to the church fellowship dinners you will get the best food you ever ate. This is cooked by older farm wives the old fashioned way. <br />
<br />
This is the way I have cooked bacon all my life. <br />
<br />
To clean the skillet after pouring off the drippings. Hold it under the cold water faucet and wipe with a paper towel. It will have a slight sheen of animal fat on the surface. Put it in your over to store it. I keep all my cast irons skillets there. For just myself I use a little skillet. Maybe 5 inches or so. <br />
<br />
With the white beans and cornbread you got to have a good white onion or Valdia onion. Can't never get too much black pepper on white beans, some say. <br />
<br />
Again I must say. Don't try this with city bacon. Not the same. <br />
Now that many of the local smokehouse folks are out of business I am considering building one myself. A small metal one out back. My friend made one and it was easy. Got the plans out of Mother Earth some time back.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">I agree that oven baking produces the best texture and flavor.  Many restaurants bake bacon, both for taste and because you can cook enough to feed a crowd without taking up all your skillets.<br />
<br />
The slower bacon is cooked, the more flavorful it is.  However, as a compromise between flavor and speed,  I find that a medium oven works well.  My method is to stack the bacon in two-strip piles in a cold, ungreased pan, put in a cold oven and turn the oven to 350 F (gas mark 4ish).  Depending on the thickness of your bacon and how crispy you like it, it is cooked in about 15 minutes, and it renders enough fat out so you have a respectable amount of dripping for later use.  If you like very well-done bacon, you should remember that baked bacon does continue to cook for about a minute after it's removed from the heat--so take it out a little early to avoid a charred mess.  <br />
<br />
I miss British bacon.  On the other hand, since I save bacon drippings for other uses, there's not that much waste from American streaky bacon.  Just have to cook more slices to make a decent sandwich.</div>

I believe what you are talking about is hog jawl. You can ask your grandpa about it. If he is an oldtimer than grew up on a farm, he might know that hog jawl is eaten on New Years Day along with black eyed peas with a coin in them for good luck. <br />
<br />
Hog jawl can be bought in a Kroger or Publix or larger grocery store from time to time. They usually cut it too thin tho. It should have a thick skin on it that takes a long time to completely chew up. You can cut the skin off and chew it seperately during the day to get the bacon taste. It will help you not be hungry between meals if thick enough and cooked right.</div>

					<div class="commentsubject">Subject: <span>My opinions on bacon cooking from much experience</span><br /></div>
					<div class="commentbody">I <b>love</b> bacon. I buy it in 3 lb packs from a discount wholesale store. I usually eat a bit after cooking and refridgerate the rest to eat as a snack out of ziplock bags like chips. I have tried almost all of the methods listed above. The best method I have found so far is based on the microwave (although grilling arguably makes for a better taste and has its own advantages listed at the end of this).<br />
<br />
A favorite saying of mine: "Everything tastes better with bacon, even bacon."<br />
<br />
Take a pyrex dish or bowl. I prefer the large wide mixing bowls since you can fit more slices in per batch and only have to clean the bowl once at the end of all of your cooking. The wide opening also gives you the advantage of fitting whole slices of bacon if your microwave is large enough. Place a bamboo rack on top of the bowl. I have also used wooden spoons and bamboo skewers before, but they can be a pain to use since they roll if you're not careful while placing the bacon. Place two stacked paper towels on top of the bacon to keep it from splattering in your microwave. Cook the bacon in your microwave for about 4-5 minutes at 70% power. Experiment with the power settings and time to find what works best for you. I use a lower power to more evenly cook the bacon. Most of the fat will drip into the bowl. Clean up is remarkably easy. Dump the fat into some empty soup cans and let them cool before you throw them away. Use some dish soap to get the residue from the bowl. I usually handwash the bamboo rack as well, but you could place the bowl and rack in a dishwasher, too, for a more thorough clean.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
<br />
+ Your bacon will be less greasy.<br />
+ Easy to clean and makes no mess.<br />
+ Using the microwave timer, you can note exact times required for different levels of cooking: limp bacon for sandwiches, crisp bacon for a breakfast side. This makes future cooking a breeze.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
<br />
- The bacon can tend to cur<b></b>l downward at the ends. You can correct for this by using a bamboo rack, or by better placement of the wooden spoons or bamboo skewers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Disadvantages of other methods:<br />
<br />
Skillet:<br />
<br />
- Constant supervision<br />
- Splatter<br />
- Greasier<br />
<br />
Oven:<br />
<br />
- Harder to clean<br />
- Greasier<br />
- Takes a long time<br />
<br />
Broiler:<br />
<br />
- Same as oven, except for the tendency for burning as Michael notes in the article<br />
<br />
George Foreman grill:<br />
<br />
- Seems to take a while and you can't fit that many slices at once.<br />
- Also, I only have the small version and have to cut the bacon in half.<br />
<br />
Special microwave dishes for bacon:<br />
<br />
- They tend to <b>melt</b> after the first batch or two! I've tried the one above and several others.<br />
- Can only cook 4-5 slices at a time, usually.<br />
- The vertical ones leave your bacon looking funny with a "V" shape. Matter of taste(pun not intended), I guess.<br />
<br />
Grilling:<br />
<br />
+ The bacon tastes good.<br />
+ Can cook ALL of your bacon at once if your grill is large enough<br />
- Takes a while, but the results can be worth it.<br />
- Messy to clean. You <b>DO</b> clean your grill, don't you?</div>

<br />
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.  Lay bacon directly on the foil, not touching.  Turn bacon over at about 10-12 minutes; very thin bacon may be done now, thicker bacon will take as long as 12-16 minutes total.  Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate.  You can eat it right away, or put it aside for a bit and, covering it with a paper towel, reheat it for 30 seconds in the microwave (for those of you who have trouble getting the timing right with multiple dishes).</div>

Personally, I usually trim most of the fat off the streaky end and keep just the pink bits. Oh, and pan frying it is usually best (although I haven't tried baking it for 3 hours!)<br />

Me, although not American, grew up with American style bacon (streaky bacon) and even though I live in Australia now, I cannot get used to the taste of Aussie bacon. It just isn't bacon. It's ham. Australians bash American bacon just because theirs have more meat, but Aussie bacon really lacks the smoky flavor. It's just salty ham. I'm still trying to find the American kind here...</div>

<br />
The general American trend to cook the bacon till completely crisp is not the common way of cooking it over here though. We generally cook it till the fat has gone crispy but the meat is still chewy.<br />
<br />
I think grilled bacon tastes far and away the best between grilled baked and fried. Never tried the microwave method though. will have to give it a go.<br />

Broiling, in this context, means to cook food directly under a heat source. In American ovens, an additional heating element is often placed at the top of the oven (either a gas jet or electrical heating element) under which you place food. The heat is very intense and localized. In older ovens, the broiling element was the same as the oven heating element (below the cooking chamber) and a special broiler drawer is used to broil food.</div>

All in all it takes about 5 to 10 minutes off of the conventional time it takes just cooking in the pan, which can be important when you are preparing complimentary dishes that take less time to cook.</div>

In the past there wasn't grocery stores like we think of them now, the nearest town might be 5 hours away by horse, and there was no such thing as vegetable oils. The only sources of cooking fat came from either animal fat or butter, and cows would stop giving milk in the winter. On my grandparents farm they would render fat into lard, and they salted and smoked bacon so it would last through the winter. The bacon dripping were poured off into a small covered crock and used in place of butter through the winter (I still have the crock!). I think that this cut of meat was chosen on purpose to make bacon with because it was so fatty, and the thin slices come from having to ration it out to last through the winter. The lard didn't have a strong taste and was used to make breads, pies, cakes, etc.</div>

I buy bulk whole bacon when it's cheaper here (Australia) and trim it, separating the eyes, which don't need much cooking, from the rest. The eyes I use immediately for recipes I don't want fatty bits in, or fry it lightly, then freeze, because cooked bacon freezes well, where raw bacon doesn't. The streaky bits I oven cook spread on trays because you can do a lot at a time and it doesn't need much attention. I then freeze that in ziplock bags and when I want a quick bacon sandwich or something a couple of rashers microwave very efficiently in 10 - 20 seconds and go extra crisp.</div>

Where do you think the Safeway bacon comes from? Do you think that those hogs live in apartments? Or maybe food tastes better to you, after it has plenty of additives added, and is processed in high speed factories?<br />
No, that "hick" who probably sold most of his hogs to Safeway, he doesn't know anything about making pork products, and he doesn't add any chemicals to the meat. How could it be good?<br />
You have probably already eaten hog jowl, if you have ever eaten at Cracker barrel, or had a canned ham.<br />
<br />
RE: Mayonaise with raw eggs. That is how mayonaise is made, in the wonderful delicious factories, or at home.  The raw eggs are the reason that anything made with mayonaise cannot be left out of the refrigerator for more than 1 hour.  The raw eggs start to go bad, resulting in food poisoning.  But then again, you know everything, so why not make some potato salad, RIGHT NOW, and leave it on your porch overnight. Tomorrow for lunch, ENJOY!<br />

					<div class="commentsubject">Subject: <span>Differences in Bacon</span><br /></div>
					<div class="commentbody">Some here have noted teh differences in bacon available, not just the thickness of the slices but the amount of water (effectively adding to shrinkange) and the ration of fat to lean.<br />
<br />
My uncle had a hog ranch in TX.  THere are many types of hogs and they all have differing weights for the "best" fat or lean uses.  The geographic area actually makes a difference (or used to) as far as how fat or lean meat was to be.  Remember that the hogs are raised for ALL thier meat, not just the pork belly.  One good weight for the rest of the meat might make a fatty belly, as would hogs that were "penned" verses what we would call "free range" today.<br />
<br />
His hogs always had large pens and could move at will.  They were raised on grain and sold at 190 to 200 pounds average.  If my uncle delivered at 185 pounds he would not be paid enough to stay in business, teh same at 202 pounds.  Believe me, they were all very close in size (average) by sex.  It was amazing because My uncle would one day say "its time to sell them" ....he would never have weighed them he just knew by looking.<br />
<br />
The point is that the companies that make the bacon heavily brine them, use sugars and other unnecessary items in curing, add liquid smoke, add additional salt and then at packaging add and inject water.  They do NOT care about a good product.  They are there to make money.  They certainly do not care about the "lean" of the product. Some idiot will buy it and eat it because they aer programmed to like it.<br />
<br />
I have eaten bacon that of course was brined before smoking, but never had anything added or changed after smoking, no water, nothing.  There is NO comparison of REAL bacon to the stuff being sold in the US as palletable.  There is NO meat on this stuff, if there is it is fatty streaked meat as well (penned hogs) from flacid muscles.<br />
<br />
WE need a minor revolution in bacon to have good product.<br />
<br />
The only product I was able to find that was any good at all was sold in stores in the San Jose area as cut ends and peaces of bacon (the drops and cuttings from processing).  It was meaty, thick and even huge chunks.  It was cheap.  It was better than any I have found as regular store items.<br />
<br />
If you are int eh SF bay area (unfortunately I am now in FL) try Cosentinos Markets, they sometimes have fairly good bacon in the meat department.  I watch for exceptionally lean product even there before buying, I even make them sort some for me if I can.<br />
<br />
As to the cooking of the bacon.....after having read all the reports and methods, it seems that there is a thread of evidence that would make one believe that cooking for over 15 to 20 minutes under a heat that allows this without burning delivers the best results.  I believe that is correct as I usually slow cook on stove top or oven  for about 20 to 30 minutes myself</div>

I thought that if I had a multi rack over a drip pan with water in it,  and at 400 degrees, I would have the fastest cooking method.  Has anyone seen a multi rack that would be smell enough to fit in a toaster/conv oven?  The racks would only have to be about 1/2 inch to 1 inch apart.  Four to five layers could probably fit.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">Before reading this post I had never given much thought about the way bacon was (or should be) cooked.  Throw it in a hot frying pan until crispy then dry on paper towels.  For cooking at home now I use the baking method.  Typically I'll wake up at 3:00AM turn the oven to 200 degrees and put in a half sheet with a rack to hold the bacon out of the grease.  At 6:00AM when I get up I kick the oven up to 400 degrees for about 10 minutes to finish.  Best bacon I've ever cooked.<br />
<br />
A while ago I enjoyed breakfast at a place called The Tractor Room in San Diego.  The bacon came out in an interesting looking curl.  It was absolutely incredible.  When I inquired as to how it was prepared they told me that they deep fried it.  Nice, but I'm not going to put a commercial deep fryer in my kitchen.  <br />
<br />
Now I'm looking forward to grilling some bacon.  Would have already tried this if I was still living with my ex.  We had a nice deck off the kitchen with a wonderful gas grill.  God I miss that &lt;del&gt;girl&lt;/del&gt; grill.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">Every weekend I pull out a pack of Hormel Black Label (UNCOOKED) bacon from my fridge. This is by far the best "supermarket bacon" available, and, if cooked right, tastes like pure heaven (and pure heart attack, but hell, I've got more important things to worry about. Like whether or not I'll have enough bacon next week.)<br />
<br />
Be careful, though. I've seen a lot of stores carry Hormel Black Label, but most likely it's fake. Unless you're dirt poor or enjoy this stuff, do NOT get the precooked junk. Definitely not worth it! I'd rather eat the package it came in.<br />
<br />
Tip: If you're pan frying, put simply anything over the pan to cover it. If it has a lid, great. Just make sure there's an opening so the steam can get out. This reduces the risk of splatter greatly, although you have to be careful when you're flipping the bacon. (Pretty obvious but I see a lot of you still complaining about it...)<br />

					<div class="commentbody">I have to give my kids credit for this one. They wanted to make bacon that was twirly--curled around like a corkscrew. I thought about it and decided we might be able to use drinking straws as the form. So we wrapped bacon strips around a straw, like the red stripe on a candy cane. Then we cooked it the normal way in the microwave. It worked quite well and the kids were very excited about the way it looked. The straws will get very melty and sometimes are hard to separate from the bacon. But it's a fun experience for the kids.</div>

actually when bacon is still sizzling hot - whether you do it in the microwave on pan/griddle, it is very pliable.<br />

cook it up, then quickly wrap it around the handle of a wooden spoon (for example) - allow to cool.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">My brother has a Makin' Bacon, and I am not a fan.  The one I have used, with consistently good results for about eight years, is the BaconWave.  (Walmart.com has them, but the retail store does not.)  It holds the bacon strips on their edges, and quite a lot of fat renders out.  It's clear, with a few little bacony bits in it, just as Michael described for the Makin' Bacon.  With the BaconWave come skewers to hold the ends of the strips in place, but I've never used them.  One caution is that the instructions for the BaconWave generally have too-long cooing times, so be prepared to experiment.<br />
<br />
Some folks mentioned how fatty standard American bacon is.  I agree. But John F. Martin (based in Lancaster PA, I believe) makes excellent bacon -- a nice smoky flavor, but not overpowering, and significantly less fat than national brands.  The bacon comes in regular and low salt, but they taste equally good to me.  Only annoyance (a minor one) is that the strips are sometimes not uniformly thick.</div>

I usually bake my bacon on a rack at 350 for about 20 minutes. There's no need to slow cook it and you'll get very straight and evenly cooked bacon. You can even flavor it with spices, maple syrup or whatever you like and get the same results.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">Just in the past month or so, I've discovered the wonders of slow baking bacon in the oven, partially thanks to this site.<br />
<br />
One morning, my wife wanted waffles.  She's grown accustomed to my raised (yeasted) waffle recipe, which I usually let rise overnight.  But I needed it for the morning, and it needs at least an hour for the yeast to ferment.<br />
<br />
So I figured it was the perfect time to try out the slow baking method.  I put the oven at 200 degrees (as suggested here), and the bacon cooked for about 90 minutes like that.  No mess.  No burnt stains on the aluminum foil (as I've seen before at high temperature).  Perfectly clear drippings.<br />
<br />
The bacon wasn't quite done at that point, so I turned the oven up slightly as I started to make the waffles.  The flavor was UNBELIEVABLE.  Texture was fantastic -- uniformly crispy with just the right amount of chewy.  I had a guest for brunch as well as my wife; both said it was about the best bacon they had ever had.<br />
<br />
Higher temperatures do the trick, but few comments seem to discuss trying the slow baking method.  Yes, you need extra time, but some weekend morning when you're up early and the rest of the family is sleeping in, put the bacon in and just let it slow cook until people get up.  You can always raise the temperature to finish it if you need to, but any additional time is worth it.</div>

I stumble out of bed, lay in the bacon, turn burner to about 1.5 of 10 (electric burner).  Don't use any oil on pan; you want it to stick--the bacon strips are super flat; even the fat is crunchy.  Go back to bed.  About an hour or so later, smell wakes me up, and 'm happy!  While making the breakfast, you can play around with the finishing heat.   The remaining bacon fat should be crystal clear.</div>

					<div class="commentbody">As other have said, in the UK bacon is is 90% meat, with some fat round the edge. I've played with the sugestions on this site (thanks!) to cook cheap bulk offers of bacon from the supermarket. Once cooked, you can scoff a slice straight from the freezer! Sounds nasty but is nice. <br />
<br />
The disadvantage is the potential erosion of your economical frozen stash.<br />

If you try it, you won't thank me for this observation... it's so tempting.<br />
