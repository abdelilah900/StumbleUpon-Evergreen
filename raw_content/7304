Old as it may be, I hadn&#8217;t heard of milk punch before a few weeks ago but can assure you, I&#8217;ve thought about nothing else since, not blizzards, not book deadlines and not how long it will take for all of the molars to show up so we can get back to sleeping again. Nope, nothing but milk punch. An avid fan of eggnog &#8212; also, John Denver &#038; The Muppets Chrismas album, carolers, chestnuts roasting on open fires and all sorts of things that are probably not expected from girl who celebrates Hanukah &#8212; but wary of all of the raw eggs and too impatient to tuck it away for anywhere from three weeks to a year to mellow flavor, milk punch seemed right up my alley.</p>

<p>Like all great drinks, it has an equally great history. Namely, that if you&#8217;re using it to cure whatever ails as you ring in the new year (or tomorrow, as a hair of the nog that bit you and yes, I <i>do</i> crack myself up) you&#8217;re doing it <i>absolutely right</i> as milk punch was initially concocted not as what I unbiasedly believe to be the coolest thing you could mix up at a party tonight but as medication. Apparently, people drank it in colonial times (even Ben Franklin had his <a href="http://www.masshist.org/objects/2004december.cfm">own recipe</a>!), people drank it on Mississippi riverboats but then sometime around World War 2, it fell off the map everywhere but New Orleans. Ah, New Orleans, this is just one more reason we like you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5310009248/" title="sifting powdered sugar"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5005/5310009248_0df44636c0.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="sifting powdered sugar" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-7052"></span></p>
<p>Recipes for milk punch vary wildly. Some use superfine sugar, others use powdered sugar, which dissolves almost instantaneously. You might use brandy, whiskey or bourbon in it, but you know I used bourbon because, well, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/about/faq/#37">I always do</a>. Some use milk, some use half-and-half (half cream, half milk, with about 10.5 to 18 percent milkfat) and many use both. The recipe below uses both but I&#8217;m going to be honest, given that most of us have retired any notions of healthfulness, at least until tomorrow, I might make it next time with all half-and-half as more of a cushion against the high booze ratio. Some recipes have you shake it with ice and serve it immediately but the ones I couldn&#8217;t get out of my head had you freeze it until slushy, a word I can assure you is much more charming inside this apartment than <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/31/nyregion/31slush.html?hp">out</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been poking around the web this afternoon, since we dropped the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5310270865/">little snowman</a> off at his grandparents for the night, and I&#8217;ve read a lot of beautiful summaries of the year. There are recipes for black-eyed peas and tallies of the highs of 2010 and for a moment, I fretted that the pressure was on to say something pithy and clever. But did you read that part about dropping the baby off? You see, I have a party to get to and hope you don&#8217;t mind that I made you a drink instead. It&#8217;s slushy but toasty and I hope you clink glasses tonight with everyone that you love.</p>

<p><b>Milk Punch</b><br />
Adapted from Canal House, v.2</p>
<p>5 cups of a mixture of whole milk and half-and-half (4:1 is suggested, but I might go more like 3:2 next time)<br />
1 1/2 cups bourbon, another whiskey or brandy<br />
1 cup powdered sugar, sifted<br />
1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br />
Freshly grated nutmeg, for garnish.</p>
<p>In a pitcher, whisk together milk, half-and-half, bourbon, sugar and vanilla. Freeze until slushy, which will take 3 to 4 hours, but you can leave it in there up to a day. Stir before serving it in chilled glasses, finished with a few gratings of fresh nutmeg.</p>

				<p>I came so close to making some of this for Christmas this year, but decided against it as I would have had to drink it all myself! (We just had a baby, and it would have been perhaps unwise to get too crunked-up solo.) I did however, make a ton of recipes from the canal house series over the weekend. It&#8217;s my absolute favorite series around right now. So beautiful! If you have v. 5, you have to try the celeriac remoulade that they have paired with the roasted pork belly. One the best sides I&#8217;ve  tried in a while, and so simple. . .</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve never heard of milk punch either. Interesting! I like eggnog so I am sure I would like this. Some of my closest friends are Jewish and they get more into Christmas than I do! haha Happy New Year!</p>

				<p>Milk and bourbon?  What&#8217;s not to love?  Unfortunately, though I have much of the latter due spending the spring in Louisville, I have none of the former.  Dare I use soy milk?  Or should I hit Amigos Mercado before they close?  Decisions&#8230;</p>

				<p>Next time, you might want to consider just making a milkshake, also known as my Mom&#8217;s Fancy Milk Punch. The best vanilla ice cream you can find, bourbon, nutmeg, whole milke (or hlaf n half or light cream also work well): whiz it up in a blender and voila! Milk Punch. No extra freezing time required!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve heard of Milk Punch but never had it. Considering that I love bourbon and that the NYE party I was going to has been canceled due to illness (the host&#8217;s, not mine), I may pare this recipe down some and stick it in the freezer in the next few minutes, to be ready when the cat and I celebrate at midnight!</p>

				<p>OH MY GOSH! So simple! So delicious! I love that you&#8217;re a bourbon girl!<br />
I literally just got back from the kitchen where I mixed up a mini batch of to see how I liked it- before using up all my good bourbon&#8230;<br />
I used almond milk- just because it&#8217;s all I had in the fridge- and I have to say the thick and creamy texture of almond milk lends itself to this perfectly! YUM YUM! Can&#8217;t wait for it to come out of the freezer!!!</p>

				<p>We serve a dish here in the South called &#8220;Boiled Custard&#8221; that is somewhat redolent of your Milk Punch.  The recipe for Boiled Custard requires whole eggs, much stirring on the stove, cream, milk, vanilla, sugar and is served chilled &#8212; preferably in grandmother&#8217;s antique cut glass pitcher. Bourbon or rum are usually added if a more festive party is desired. We serve it at my house for all afternoon and evening parties during the Christmas holidays. We call it Yumm Rum&#8230;.because once tasted, you keep wanting to keep back for more. Then the alcohol creeps up on you not to mention the calories. But who&#8217;s counting? Right?</p>

				<p>Happy New Year from New Zealand!  This looks good!  Could you speed up the freezing until slushy part by using your icecream maker, or does the time in the freezer mellow something out? It&#8217;s a pretty warm summer here, and this looks like a good late afternoon/early evening treat.</p>

				<p>I love/hate realizing that the dishes my family made when I was a child are actual dishes, and not just a Brown Family &#8220;thing.&#8221;  No bourbon for the children, of course, but this was a special treat throughout the year when there was no ice cream in the freezer.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve made a similar recipe for a holiday party a couple years ago as an eggnog alternative &#8211; it was *quite* yummy.</p>

				<p>When you say &#8216;powdered sugar&#8217; do you mean confectioner&#8217;s sugar? Because they&#8217;re not the same thing. Confectioner&#8217;s sugar has cornstarch in it. Powdered sugar is REALLY, REALLY superfine sugar, at least in the UK&#8230;</p>

				<p>My husband had nothing but whiskey around one day, nothing to mix it with and didn&#8217;t want it straight.. He searched high and low on the internet and stumbled upon a recipe for Milk Punch, low and behold there was milk in the fridge and powdered sugar in the pantry. He mixed this concoction up and to this day is a believer. I however was not convinced with his recipe. Maybe I should try this one and be forever changed.</p>

				<p>The New York Times had a fantastic milk punch recipe a few weeks ago in their holiday drinks guide. I served it Christmas morning and it was a huge hit with everyone. They suggested freezing a tray of milk cubes in the freezer the night before so the drink doesn&#8217;t get diluted and it worked wonderfully. Happy new year!</p>

				<p>I just made milk punch for the first time a few weeks ago when my parents were here &#8212; interesting that it is a hangover cure,  my father told me he had a hangover before he even went to bed from drinking it! (Probably because he assumed the punch was only for him and had multiple glasses.)  Love that Penzey&#8217;s vanilla!</p>
<p>Happy new year!</p>

				<p>This is a perfect way to bring in the New Year! As a Louisvillian, I am happy to agree with you that bourbon is, in fact, a food group. This recipe puts it to very good use. (And we all need more calcium, right?!) Thank you for another delicious year of recipes and baby photos. All the best to you in 2011!</p>

				<p>Yum! I mixed a small batch and it&#8217;s in the freezer now. Looking forward to it&#8230;<br />
A good substitute for egg nog is boiled custard.<br />
6 C milk, 6 egg yolks, 3/4 C sugar, 1 t vanilla. My original directions say to cook the milk then temper the eggs, but I&#8217;ve found that I can just throw the milk eggs and sugar together in a pot and cook on medium stirring constantly until it thickens enough to coat the back of a stainless spoon. Add vanilla and chill. (I&#8217;ve found that I have to strain it through a wire mesh strainer whether or not I temper the eggs).<br />
Tastes like liquid custard and the eggs get cooked, so it&#8217;s a win-win!</p>

				<p>1) Looks yummy. 2) Would be even better&#8211;and FASTER&#8211;churned in the ice cream maker. 3) No need to fear raw eggs if you used pasteurized ones. 4) Could cook this as an egg nog custard and then churn it in the ice cream maker&#8230; The high alcohol content would keep it slushy, a few egg yolks (5 max) would make it extra rich, and the ice cream churn would freeze it in about a half an hour (presuming the cooked custard is cold before you put it in there. Ok, I&#8217;m an ice cream fan, so forgive me&#8230;and happy new year! :)</p>

				<p>My earliest taste of milk punch was at Green Pastures in Austin. It was amazing &#8211; sweet but not cloying, decadent but not embarrassingly so. I could have consumed an entire pitcher on my own, but since it was an early outing with my future in-laws, I managed a tiny bit of self-control. Very tiny. Thanks for the reminder of this wonderful treat. And Happy New Year to you and yours :)</p>

				<p>Inspired by your post (and Ben Franklin) I made this tonight, and it was delicious! Somewhat unglamourously, but very practically, I put the ingredients (including freshly grated nutmeg) into individual mason jars, and then just capped them, shook them up really well, and placed them in the freezer for a couple hours. They were delicious!!</p>

				<p>AB: Powdered and/or confectioners sugar have miniscule (approximately 3%) amounts of a non-caking agent to keep it from clumping together. In the United States, it&#8217;s usually corn starch, and in France and other European countries, it has silicate (or the mineral tricalcium phosophate) added. I&#8217;ve done side-by-side tests and because it&#8217;s such a tiny quantity, they&#8217;re interchangeable in recipes like this where it&#8217;s going to be dissolved in liquids. You can also grind granulated sugar in a food processor until it&#8217;s powdery to make your own.</p>

				<p>Great post. I, too, have been perusing everyone&#8217;s &#8220;wrap ups&#8221; and I must say I enjoyed the milk punch. As a history teacher and devotee of the colonial period I had come across the term but had no idea what the recipe entailed. Thanks for the lesson. Hope the snowman enjoyed his stay at the grandparents, and that mom and dad enjoyed their evening out. Much joy in 2011!</p>

				<p>Yay &#8211; so many fellow Kentuckians representing!  I applaud your use of Knob Creek &#8211; it&#8217;s my favorite bourbon for regular drinking (but I&#8217;m all about Maker&#8217;s for cooking, because it&#8217;s cheaper and I don&#8217;t feel so guilty about using it in quantity).  Bourbon rocks!</p>

				<p>Happy New Year Great lady with the cutest kid!  I love your blog and wish you and yours nothing but the best for the New Year!  You&#8217;ve introduced me to a lot of new things (new to me anyway) over the last few years, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I hope to read your blog for years to come.  Really looking forward to your cookbook too!</p>

				<p>Lynne &#8212; I wish you were our <em>upstairs</em> neighbors, as they are very loud and take to what I assume must be clogging at all hours of the night, and you seem like you&#8217;d be much more charming!</p>
<p>Erica &#8212; We love Basil Hayden, Eagle Rare and the one with the horse figurine on the top that I always forget the name of. Probably because I am drinking it.</p>
<p>Eileen &#8212; More guilt about never finishing that book! My MIL borrowed it from our bookcases two weeks ago and declared it one of the best books she&#8217;d ever read. Obviously, it&#8217;s time I try again.</p>
<p>AB &#8212; Here, powdered and confectioner&#8217;s sugar are the same thing. However, if you only have superfine sugar around, no reason you cannot use it (as I mention in the post, many recipes use that instead; you&#8217;ll just want to make sure to stir until it dissolves).</p>

				<p>I had my first milk punch at Brennan&#8217;s in New Orleans.  Of course, it was wonderful!  Nothing like some delicious booze at breakfast!  To you who mentioned Green Pastures, thanks for the memories.  I have eaten there (sublime) and my sister got married there in 1999.  Gorgeous place for a wedding, and wonderful buffet for the reception.  I live in Dallas, but Austin really rocks!</p>

				<p>Update to the caramel cake (sorry I missed it before!). Your buttermilk cake is perfect &#8211; just try real penuche frosting and be prepared to swoon. Try the penuche from Gourmet 10/1990 (Epicurious &#8211; applesauce cake with penuche frosting). Low ratings because the reviewers didn&#8217;t understand that penuche takes some care. My aunt made a signature buttermilk cake with caramel frosting and between your cake and Gourmet&#8217;s penuche, I think I finally have it. Happy New Year!</p>

				<p>Lovely Deb!  Always lovely!!<br />
We in fact had a party last evening, and we made nutty Irishman&#8230;milk, half and half, Irish Whiskey and hazelnut liquor! Tis&#8217; another good recipe, but, I think with bourbon instead ( I&#8217;m with you on the bourbon, it&#8217;s a food staple!) I think I&#8217;d go with the nutty hill-billy.<br />
Yes dear, as the 1st day of the year, and some old classic movies on the TV this evening, Milk Punch will be the evenings desired drink.<br />
Thanks for sharing so much with us throughout the year.  Thank you for sharing that precious little guy ( just love him!)  I can&#8217;t wait till your cook book comes out, I&#8217;ll be first in line with bells on!  Have a happy and completely blessing filled year!</p>

				<p>Milk punch is the nectar of the gods. I first had it at Bourbon House in New Orleans. They make it with ice milk so it is almost like drinking a milkshake. A delicious, boozy milkshake. </p>
<p>I believe I will be trying this soon, though.</p>

				<p>I am a big fan of Penzey&#8217;s. I&#8217;d also like to recommend Rancho Gordo, which not only sells fantastic beans but also excellent Mexican Vanilla ($9.95 for 4 oz.)</p>
<p>I live in Canada and order from both Penzey&#8217;s and Rancho Gordo &#8212; it&#8217;s worth the effort.</p>
<p>(Needless to say, my only connection to these companies is as an avid customer.)</p>

				<p>Hello to all readers and happy New Year, well I&#8217;m a Mexican lady and here in Mexico at this time it&#8217;s very cold so we drink many kind of milk punches and one delicious is exactly like this one, but instead of putting half&amp;half we just boil the milk with the sugar, add some evaporated milk and out of the stove put the Bourbon, vanilla and a pinch of nutmeg or cinnamon powder.<br />
Salud !!!<br />
Thank you Deb for such a lovely site and a very good recipe !</p>

				<p>You had me with half and half and bourbon, but had to comment because of John Denver and the Muppets. My all time favorite Christmas album. Well, maybe a tie with Harry Connick, Jr. Seems more appropriate with the cocktails anyway.</p>

				<p>I used brandy, I like the mellower flavour, BUT I wouldn&#8217;t use near as much as the recipe calls for.  I might even cut the alcohol amount in half, I think that flavor needs to be a little more subtle.  It could just be that different types of alcohol produce different results and you just have to keep trying till you get it right!</p>

				<p>I have been seeing recipes for milk punch all over this year, but none with reviews &#8211; they all seemed to be more along the lines of &#8220;Man, we should try this sometime!&#8221; I&#8217;m so glad it turned out well, because I needed a new winter booze recipe!</p>

				<p>During last week&#8217;s blizzard, I was just telling my kids here in NJ about growing up in the mountains of western north carolina and making &#8220;snow cream&#8221; which was clean, freshly fallen  snow  we scooped into plastic mixing bowls, which my mom would put into glasses with a dash of vanilla and milk poured over the whole thing.  They were disappointed I wouldn&#8217;t let them collect snow up here to &#8220;drink&#8221;, but without the booze, this is a similar idea for a snowy day treat.</p>

				<p>We had milk punch at our wedding in lieu of champagne. It was white, decadent and perfect for toasting in the early afternoon. Our punch included ice cream in the mix, to keep it extra thick, creamy and cold.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the recipe, Deb.  My mom used to make eggnog for me for breakfast.  The &#8220;not so&#8221; real deal with raw egg, but nonfat milk and no bourbon.  I loved it, but haven&#8217;t had it in ages.  I&#8217;m thinking of exploring it again because we have laying hens out back, so I&#8217;m not too concerned about illness.  I&#8217;ll definitely try the milk punch though.</p>

				<p>I tried it and liked it! Maker&#8217;s Mark Bourbon was the deal&#8230;I used 1/2 half and half and the rest milk. Is that the reason it was way slushy or I might say more than slushy? Very good still. Delightful!</p>

				<p>This sounds brilliant- I have never been fond of the idea of eggnog, but love milky drinks, slushy drinks&#8230;and bourbon, so what could be better than combining them? It&#8217;s the new year already, but here in Auckland it is bakingly hot and I think these would go down excellently for sitting on the deck in the sun for no occasion at all. Happy New Year to you and yours Deb, I am looking forward another year following your site.</p>

				<p>My father makes a similar &#8220;drink&#8221; every Christmas, although I suppose it&#8217;s actually more of a Brandy Alexander. He uses a couple of scoops of vanilla bean ice cream, plenty of crushed ice, a splash of milk, then brandy, creme de cacao, and nutmeg on top. So good! And he uses an old avocado-colored ice crusher that we have had for ages. Served with a nice cookie tray, it&#8217;s a great way to end a Christmas meal.</p>

				<p>We here at GU Detroit have been drinking vast quantities of milk punch since the weather turned cooler in November- Todd, one of our founders, blogged about it and talked about it on NPR for a holiday segment. His family has a raw milk share and hoo boy is it good made with that milk! We use Buffalo Trace Bourbon in it- reasonably priced and it won our blind taste test.</p>

				<p>This is a staple at Scranton Times 25 Year Club, and as it is a closely guarded secret. They are probably wondering whether to get a journalist on the &#8220;leak.&#8221;  When time is too short for full freezing, there is an alterate serving technique:  a generous dollop of whipped cream in a wine glass before the pouring in the punch.  I have had it served with a small scoup of good vanilla icecream in the glass instead.</p>

				<p>I love Bourbon Milk Punch.  Love it!  Years ago (I mean, years, like 30 or more) I had a Bourbon Milk Punch at the Redwood Room in the Clift Hotel here in San Francisco.  To die for.  A few days later I had a friend over helping to trim the tree.  Mentioned this miraculous Milk Punch I&#8217;d had but had no idea how to make.  Light bulb went off in my head.  Picked up the phone and called the bartender at the Redwood Room and asked for their recipe.  Guess what?  He happily shared it.  Ready?  Here it is &#8212; buy a good quality vanilla ice cream, let it melt, a little &#8212; you want it still slush.  Add more vanilla (if you want) nutmeg (also optional) and lots (or to taste) of good bourbon plus a shake of nutmeg on top.  There you go.  Easy, peasy.  Basically a vanilla milkshake with bourbon.  Hiccup.  Happy New Year!</p>

				<p>The very day you posted this I was telling dear hubby about milk punch. I&#8217;ve often seen the same recommendation other mentioned, using ice cream instead. It is delicious with Breyers Natural Vanilla. In fact, I am surprised so many post-ers hadn&#8217;t heard of it either. Cheers!</p>

				<p>Usually I say, &#8220;Yum!&#8221; when I read the recipes on your blog, but today I thought &#8220;High Glucose Level!&#8221;  Reminded a bit of elementary school milk left on the doorstep on the school on a cold winter&#8217;s day, when the cardboard top would pop off and make it slushy.  And the teacher would say, &#8220;Drink it!&#8221; and we&#8217;d all watch Debbie Bowman gag it down because more than likely she was lactose intolerant in 1968 when nobody knew what that meant!  Maybe adding the bourbon and sugar will help&#8230; why didn&#8217;t I think of that in 3rd grade?  I may skip this one!</p>

				<p>Milk Punch has been a cold-weather tradition in my family since before my time! I&#8217;m almost embarrassed to admit that I&#8217;m usually the one appointed as master Milk Puncher these days because I learned how to make so well as a small child. My grandmother used to sit in her chair and ask my cousin and I to mix it up (she then added her own bourbon to taste, of course &#8211; I didn&#8217;t have real bartending endeavors til later in life) :)  It works just as well if you use fresh snow. Go out right after a snow, before it gets disturbed (usually best from a snow that has covered a previous layer) scoop it up and add the rest of the ingredients&#8230;..like a little piece of heaven :)</p>

				<p>I love learning that things I thought were universal were really only particular to my little neck of the woods.  I&#8217;m from Louisiana (not New Orleans, though) and milk punch is kind of a regular thing.  Not an every day thing but a very common festive brunch or wedding shower thing.  It is quite delicious!  Glad you are enjoying our little regional specialty.</p>

				<p>This sounds like it would be incredible and a good use for that bourbon I got for Christmas. It also reminds me of one of my favorite drinks of all time&#8230;the amaretto milkshake (which is just what it sounds like, and can be made with either vanilla or chocolate ice cream). Thanks for sharing!</p>

				<p>I love that you blogged about milk punch!  We have been making a &#8220;New Orleans&#8221; style meal (gumbo, onion pie, etc.) for Christmas day the past three years and milk punch makes such a nice conclusion to such a meal.  This year being stingy and preggo, I didn&#8217;t bother making the milk punch, but can&#8217;t wait until next Christmas when I can enjoy a nice tall glass of it!  I have never put mine in the freezer and will be doing so next year.  Happy New Year!</p>

				<p>I churned mine in my ice cream maker because I&#8217;m impatient, then stirred in a lot of nesquik. Felt really guilty about using top shelf bourbon, but it&#8217;s all I had you know? Also good with allspice</p>

				<p>Love this! I like it hot sometimes instead of slushy and with anise instead of vanilla (also good without the booze). It&#8217;s easiest to use anise sugar cubes, but you can also add a heaping teaspoon of crushed anise seed for every quart of milk.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve been hooked on milk punch for about 30 years!  Variations I have used and loved:</p>
<p>Substitute half of the milk with the richest, loveliest vanilla ice cream you can find; this eliminates most of the sugar.</p>
<p>Freeze a batch into a round mould and it keeps the batch in the bowl cold but not diluted.  Though it rarely lasts long enough to get too warm.</p>

				<p>I just made a batch of this. I have to say, I was trying to use up a gallon of 2% milk (organic &#8211; makes the difference in taste) and it was just as good. I used 4 cups 2% to 1 cup half and half, with the powdered sugar and brandy. We cut eggnogg with milk anyway, so this was perfect and now we feel like it&#8217;s ok to drink more because it&#8217;s lighter. Cheers!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m WAY behind on my blog reading because of the holidays, but have to give another shout out to John Denver and the Muppets. I&#8217;ve been listening to that album every Christmas since I was a little kid (my parents were major John Denver fans), and it will always hold a special place in my heart. Who knew there were so many other fans out there?</p>

				<p>Another Kentuckian chiming in here. So glad that you posted this. Gotta love the milk punch, which I find less cloying than eggnog during the holidays. However, a bit rich for my blood to use Knob Creek for a mixed drink! I like it straight and in drinks served up (like a Sazerac made with bourbon instead of rye), but everyone I know at home uses Maker&#8217;s for their mixed drinks and high balls&#8230;..</p>

				<p>This sounds some what familiar to what we call &#8220;lassi&#8221; here in Pakistan. Its heavy and is served at breakfast usually though lassi is made of yoghurt, milk and just the right amount of sugar and then shaked up a bit usually using the traditional hand churner. Milk punch is definitely what I&#8217;d call Lassi if I wanted to translate.</p>

This looks wonderful! I wonder, have you ever tried it hot instead? We&#8217;ve just had blizzard-like weather, and a warm milk and whiskey recipe sounds like the perfect alternative to the excessive amount of hot chocolate I&#8217;ve been drinking lately. Thanks!</p>

				<p>If you like drinks with booze, nutmeg, and milk, but without eggs, try a Jamaican drink I love based on carrot juice and rum. Simply mix fresh carrot juice, evaporated milk (or sweetened condensed for a sweeter drink), vanilla extract, rum, and freshly ground nutmeg. Proportions to taste. Add lots of ice. Amazingly refreshing and good for you too. Not everyone might like the flavour of canned evaporated milk, but that&#8217;s what makes it authentic!</p>

				<p>I just made a small test batch with canned coconut milk instead of dairy milk  . . . Delish! I think the strong coconut flavor calls for half dark rum, half bourbon, though. The full-fat canned coconut milk does the slush thing very well. Thanks for all you share, Deb!</p>

				<p>This rocked our small office&#8217;s holiday party a couple weeks ago after a full year of anticipation. I&#8217;ve found my new favorite dairy-based holiday beverage!</p>

				<p>Oooh &#8211; this concoction &#8211; with rum instead of bourbon &#8211; was the heart of a smashing party my parents had in the 60&#8217;s. People are still talking about that party because of how lethal and yummy the drinks were. Proceed with caution &#8211; and make sure you&#8217;ve got some food on hand to keep things from getting too out of control.</p>
