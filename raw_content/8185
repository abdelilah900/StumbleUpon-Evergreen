	<h1>Junkie saves child with Narcan</h1>

	<table class='imgTableProfile'><tr><td class='imgTD'><img src='http://www.dosenation.com/upload/img/Adam_imagem_43438_sm.jpg' style='width:200px'></td></tr></table>				<div class="blog_body">Last week in Milton, Wisconsin, three eighth-grade children overdosed on Heroin (which they believed to be Cocaine) in a park right outside of the local Police Department. Sadly two of these three boys are dead. However one child was very lucky and his life was saved because of a nearby Heroin addict. This "junkie" had a drug called Narcan, or Naloxone. He used it to resuscitate the young man. You may have read about Narcan in the listings on sites like MAP (<a href="http://mapinc.org">http://mapinc.org</a>); it is a miracle pill (or a solution) which instantly begins to reverse a heroin overdose and saves the user's life.<p />
If you have indeed read about Narcan before today, you would know that the American government wants to control Narcan almost to the point of scheduling it right up there with Heroin (and don't rule that out, either.) A lot of people in government would like junkies to simply drop dead, you see. Some of these people actually try to argue that it should only be in the hands of paramedics and not available to the public, because they are not trained health professionals. As if NOT DYING was ever a poor health decision. Even when delivered with a syringe, while sober, Naloxone does no harm.<p />
The (unnamed) Heroin Hero of Milton, WI would have never been able to save this child's life had the bureaucrats in his district managed to abuse him as badly as those in other parts of the country. Now he is saving lives. Even if you <i>still</i> want him to die, you have to be glad he lived this long.<p />
My problem is that I had to glean this whole angle from about three or four lines of the sourced article. The event hasn't triggered anything but the standard Heroin discourse anywhere but here yet, and it probably won't. It focuses on the children who died and mentions the survivor so briefly, it's as if the subject was changed. <p />
Even the cops have trouble admitting it happened:<br />
<blockquote>The addict "did save this kid's life, more than likely," said Lt. John Conger.</blockquote><p />
I'm not glad anyone is dead, but still I hope the addict had more than a single dose of Narcan. Imagine having to decide which child's life to save.<p />

									<div class='blog_comment'><b>Cassie.</b> : 2011-08-25 22:05:00<div class='blog_comment'>The people that one would get Narcan from are government funded needle exchanges. They have you watch a 15 minute video & then you sign for it.  I also was a drug addict who was saved by Narcan & I have seen at least 5 other people who have been saved  by it!  There was a time when I would have liked to overdose & surprisingly never did!!!!  I have been clean for going on 4 years am now a full time student in college w/ a 9 month old baby who I take care of by myself since her dad lives in another state!  Most people who get clean & stay clean are people who have an amazing support system and realize that hey life is good and go off to do better things!  You people who are talking sh*t are the selfish ignorant ones!  Would you like to tell me you have never made mistakes before?!?!</div>
</div>
<div class='blog_comment'><b>J9.</b> : 2010-05-24 18:12:21<div class='blog_comment'>I'm wondering how this guy gave the kid Narcan? With one of this addict's dirty needles????? Or did he just happen to have a clean one to use??? Hmm..seems unlikely.  Does this kid now run the risk of contracting Hep B or C or even HIV? Leave it to the professionals, please!</div>
</div>
<div class='blog_comment'><b>Drew.</b> : 2010-03-18 23:35:00<div class='blog_comment'>This is possibly the most naive and under thought thing I have ever read. Why am I glad that this 'junkie' saved the life of a moronic kid who will undoubtedly find another way of killing himself. I'm so sick of this 'no fault' mentality people have, 'its not the kids fault they are dumb asses meddling in drugs when its obvious that cocaine (as they thought) is a very dangerous substance'. I'm a paramedic and Narcan is NOT harmless infact I've had people die of heart attacks and angioadema after I administered it, it should be regulated with heroin and cocaine, it is not a safe thing to be handing out.</div>
</div>
<div class='blog_comment'><b>anon.</b> : 2010-03-15 07:03:42<div class='blog_comment'>10 bucks says the "hero addict" was the one supplying these naive children in the 1st place and his so called act of kindness was instinctually motivated to save his own ass. after all once all your custys are died then how are you going to get a free bag? F U junkies, i hope you all OD</div>
</div>
<div class='blog_comment'><b>smart.</b> : 2009-11-08 21:43:10<div class='blog_comment'>thank you war on drugs for making heroin and cocaine fall into the same black drug market. </div>
</div>
<div class='blog_comment'><b>Purple Haze.</b> : 2009-10-30 15:42:39<div class='blog_comment'>   Narcan is NOT harmless and isn't a "miracle" drug. Yes, it can reverse some of the side effects of a narcotic (like heroin) overdose, BUT... It can cause your blood pressure to sky-rocket causing heart attack, stroke, etc.  A common side effect of too much Narcan is flash pulmonary edema where basically your lungs fill up with fluid and you drown in your own secretions.  If you use this drug, you need to know what you are doing with it.  Also, it's effects are shorter lived than many of the narcotics.  You might treat someone and they seem ok for a while (an hour or so) and then you leave them and it wears off and then the person "re-narcotizes" and stop breathing and die.  <br />
   That one kid was lucky, for sure. But if the guy hadn't had any Narcan in his pocket, he could have just performed rescue breathing (CPR without the chest compressions) for a few minutes until paramedics arrived who do have narcan and know how to administer the stuff and what side effects to look for and how to handle them if they occur.  Come to think of it, why didn't someone else perform rescue breathing for the other 2 kids so they would still be alive.  <br />
   I think our government has gone nuts when it comes to drug regulation, but you have got to balance that with some common sense.  Some drugs are not innocuous. Just ask Michael Jackson. </div>

<div class='blog_comment'><b>Al.</b> : 2009-10-26 16:00:02<div class='blog_comment'>Ryan, you sound like a hippie, at the very least someone who gives natural remedies a bad name... Natural remedies work well as a complement to modern medicine, and most practitioners will tell you that. Please get you head out of the clouds or stop smoking that bong you have grown so fondly of, and stop giving natural therapists a bad name. You're doing more harm than good</div>

<div class='blog_comment'><b>Biz.</b> : 2009-07-28 20:40:37<div class='blog_comment'>To Adam:<p />
hmmm....how shall i put this? you are an ignorant a**hole. i happen to be a former drug addict and alcoholic, i have been clean for 3 years come this october. i have for the most part reversed all the damage done during my addiction, i live comfortably, i am happy, i run my own business and family is back in my life. also, having been around recovery for the last 3 years, i know many, many other people who are former drug addicts and have completely changed their lives with clean year ranging from 0 to 40.<p />
i fact, you would be very surprised at just how many people in your city are former drug addicts, even people you work with and interact with on a daily basis.<p />
society should not be condemning these people, it should be encouraging them to use the resources available to them to get clean and start enjoying their lives. i have never met an addict(using or not) who i would consider an inherently bad person.</div>

<div class='blog_comment'><b>Phil E. Drifter.</b> : 2009-07-28 08:53:14<div class='blog_comment'>Batman. : 2009-07-27 22:58:40: "So your point is the government killed those kids? Come on, the government has been stating the same message over and over again: Don't use drugs." Smoke  tobacco and get lung cancer instead! Get drunk and kill a family of 4 on the road instead! (/sarcasm)<p />
"Drug addicts destroy their own lives, the lives of their loved ones, and affects everyone else negatively as well by crime activity, careless disposal of syringes etc."<p />
You've been brainwashed by government propaganda, I see. Alcohol is far and away the most dangerous drug on the planet. Why? Because no other drug turns someone into a drunken, uncoordinated, blubbering, combative bastard anywhere near the effects of alcohol. No other drug so greatly reduces ones motor coordination than alcohol.<p />
Did you not study american alcohol prohibition in grade school? I did. You know what I learned from it? It breeds violence and police corruption.<p />
So why would cannabis prohibition (the crutch of the DEA which spends 95% of their time digging up ditchweed since *surprise* the USDA ran "Hemp for Victory" urging American farmers to grow hemp 'FOR THE WAR!' because 5 years prior they'd outlawed it so they could stuff their prisons with minorities!<p />
The war on (some) drugs' goal is to prevent minorities from advancing themselves, plain and simple. Throw them in jail for 20 years for the nonviolent act of 'POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE,' which is an oxymoron since because they're illegal they're COMPLETELY UNCONTROLLED.</div>
</div>
<div class='blog_comment'><b>Phil E. Drifter.</b> : 2009-07-28 08:38:12<div class='blog_comment'>Yeah! Fuck drug users! Let's all get drunk instead!<br />
...<p />
It's not a war on (some) drugs, it's a war on minorities. HAD that heroin been legal and regulated, it'd be damn near impossible for kids to get it, short of stealing it from their parents, who shouldn't be parents anyway if they leave heroin laying around UNSECURED WHERE A CHILD CAN GET IT, like a gun. Just like a gun.<p />
Read tinyurl.com/1mn for the real history behind the 'war on (some) drugs.'  (Hint: it's not a war on some drugs, it's a war on minorities to recoup the lost of slave labor by replacing it with prison labor.)</div>
</div>
<div class='blog_comment'><b>Batman.</b> : 2009-07-27 22:58:40<div class='blog_comment'>So your point is the government killed those kids? Come on, the government has been stating the same message over and over again: Don't use drugs. <p />
Drug addicts destroy their own lives, the lives of their loved ones, and affects everyone else negatively as well by crime activity, careless disposal of syringes etc. <p />
It's a great relief for everyone whenever one stops the abuse, either by stopping in time or by dying. Whatever comes first is their choice, and if they choose the latter then its not a tragedy, its a stupid personal choice. <br />
</div>
</div>
<div class='blog_comment'><b>Jesse.</b> : 2009-07-24 16:07:07<div class='blog_comment'>To Adam:<br />
You're looking at it from a pretty narrow point of view. There are people out there that have overcome their drug habits, gone on to lead productive and full lives and are in no way someone who "deserve" to just drop dead.<br />
No one can predict the future and as Rev.Ford pointed out, if someone goes through the terrifying ordeal of OD'ing and happens to be saved from Narcan, who's to say they won't have a new-found clarity on life?<br />
The "junkies" that you obviously envision every Heroin addict as, are going to continue to abuse H regardless of a life-saving drug like this being around. No one is going to choose to overdose just because this is around, and that's just an ignorant statement. It's not like getting drunk and passing out and having some quick "sober up" pill around for you.  <br />
Try to open your mind a bit. </div>
</div>
<div class='blog_comment'><b>Adam.</b> : 2009-07-24 15:26:52<div class='blog_comment'>Hold on. Are you fucking insane? Yeah, cool that the junkie saved that kid's life. You know what else would have saved him, and the other two kids? Not snorting heroin.<p />
Yeah, great idea, keep something around that reverses a heroin overdose. "You want to get totally fuckin strung-out tonight man? Don't worry about OD-ing, I've got some Narcan." Way to encourage drug habits. I completely think more people should be OD-ing on heroin. Junkies are dying anyway, just over a long period of time. Might as well save them the misery, as well as the people in their lives that have to deal with their pathetic asses on a daily basis. </div>
</div>
<div class='blog_comment'><b>Rev. Ford.</b> : 2009-07-08 02:59:44<div class='blog_comment'>Thank you to the addict, and I hope this inspires him to turn his life fully around and keep going with his good works. I hope he gets help and support from the community. He's a hero of the unlikeliest sort.</div>
</div>
<div class='blog_comment'><b>Adam.</b> : 2009-06-25 19:09:40<div class='blog_comment'>They stole it from their parents.</div>
</div>
<div class='blog_comment'><b>Gonzobot.</b> : 2009-06-24 16:04:53<div class='blog_comment'>Woah. What kind of school do these kids go to, that they are given heroin when they ask for coke?<p />
And absolute kudos to the savior. Just another reason why legislation needs to be thrown out the window and replaced with actual common sense. If needle exchanges provided this stuff, we would have far less deaths. And trying to ban it because they're not trained? How do you think they are using those needles in the first place, hmm?</div>
