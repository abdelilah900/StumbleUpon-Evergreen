<strong><small>The 2,000-year old cocktail: it tastes as bad as it looks&#8230; but it works.</small></strong></p>
<p>My back hurts.  So does my throat, and I feel like a sumo wrestler is sitting on my head trying to pop my eyes out.</p>
<p>Alas, the common cold has got me.  Fortunately, I expect to be rid of it in 48-72 hours.</p>
<p>Like millions this time of year, I have the bug.  But, thanks to Chinese and German friends and several helpful doctors, I&#8217;ve found a few effective treatments &#8212; the closest to cures I&#8217;ve experimented with &#8212; that can get you back on your feet faster.  I suggest you test them in stages, from oldest to newest, as the side-effects tend to increase as we include modern drugs.<br />
<span id="more-312"></span></p>
<h3>The Chinese Cure for the Common Cold&#8211;Simple and Direct</h3>
<p>Despite some craziness like shark-fin soup and bear gallbladders, the Chinese have had a long time to experiment with the common cold.</p>
<p>In Beijing, I&#8217;d doubted the traditional Chinese approach to reducing fevers (bundle you up in winter clothing and force you to drink near-boiling tea or water until you sweat profusely), which ended up working like a charm, so I&#8217;ve been willing to test ideas that could have some clinical basis.</p>
<p>The ladies&#8211;my five surrogate mothers&#8211;at my neighborhood Chinese restaurant suggested the following fast-acting cold remedy (end product pictured in the first photo from this post), which &#8212; for me &#8212; cuts symptoms like sore throat and sinus pain by at least 50% over 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong>  Get fresh ginger and the orange rind (peel) from one orange, preferably organic or otherwise not treated with pesticides.  <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/" target="_blank">Trader Joe&#8217;s</a> or <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/" target="_blank">Whole Foods</a> will do.  The Epsom salts will be explained and is not part of the recipe.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/ginger-orange-peels-and-epsom-salt.jpg" alt="ginger-orange-peels-and-epsom-salt.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong> Cut the ginger into small pieces and mash them down with the side of a large kitchen knife.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/crushed-ginger.jpg" alt="crushed-ginger.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:  </strong>Bring water to a low boil (medium setting on my electric stovetop) in a small pot and insert ginger pieces.  Wait 20 minutes.  Note: to help relieve the muscular pains that often come with a cold or flu, I&#8217;ll run a hot bath during this 20 minutes, put in the entire box of Epsom salts (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_salt" target="_blank">magnesium sulfate</a>), then soak for 10 minutes before coming back to the kitchen for step 4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>  Add the orange peel sections to the boiling water and wait an additional 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong>  Strain and serve.  Be forewarned that it has a strong taste and a few dabs of organic honey will help those with girly-man stomachs (I&#8217;ll plead girly-man on this one).  The liquid/tea/soup stores well in the refrigerator but tastes 10x worse cold.</p>
<h3>The German Solution&#8211;Alcohol, Of Course!</h3>
<p>The German solution I&#8217;ve been offered is easier to describe:</p>
<p>1. Get a deep-tissue massage<br />
2. Chamomile Tea<br />
3. Spiced Rum<br />
4. Bed</p>
<p>I suspect the spiced rum could have an effect less from the alcohol and more from the cinnamon typically used to make it spicy.  Though generally thought of as being viral, the common cold is often misdiagnosed or accompanied by other types of bacteria and infection.  <a href="http://www.healthdiaries.com/eatthis/10-health-benefits-of-cinnamon.html" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthdiaries.com/eatthis/10-health-benefits-of-cinnamon.html" target="_blank">Cinnamon has been shown</a> to inhibit E. Coli and increase insulin sensitivity, among other things, which is why I take it supplementally prior to meals if I&#8217;m cycling off of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) as an insulin mimicker.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll discuss ALA at greater length another time, but here is a preview <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoic_acid" target="_blank">from wikipedia</a>: &#8220;Lipoic acid has been shown in cell culture experiments to increase cellular uptake of glucose by recruiting the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell membrane, suggesting its use in diabetes.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Modern Non-Prescription Options</h3>
<p>Though it&#8217;s true that &#8220;supplement,&#8221; &#8220;drug,&#8221; and &#8220;food&#8221; are largely legal distinctions and not biochemical ones, getting prescriptions is both time-consuming and expensive.  For shortening the duration of the common cold, I use <a href="http://www.zicam.com/Product.aspx?eid=13" target="_blank">Zicam oral mist</a> (nasal delivery can damage your sense of smell) every 3-4 hours, along with the following:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/kyolic-garlic-acidophilus-vitamin-c.jpg" alt="kyolic-garlic-acidophilus-vitamin-c.jpg" /><br />
<small>Garlic extract (2 capsules, 3x/daily), probiotic acidophilus cultures (one capsule per meal), 3mg melatonin prior to bed, 8-10 grams of vitamin C in 1g divided doses.</small></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use echinacea because I&#8217;ve found the supporting research inconsistent and it upsets my stomach.  I&#8217;m aware that some researchers dispute Linus Pauling&#8217;s conclusions about vitamin C, but I believe it&#8217;s because of insufficient dosing and spacing, as it is water soluble and can have a half-life of just 30-60 minutes.</p>
<p>From the non-ingestible standpoint, having suffered from sinus infections since childhood, I&#8217;m a proponent of sinus irrigation, which entails driving distilled water mixed with salt and baking soda in one nostril and out the other.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll do this each morning and evening as soon as symptoms appear, and it all but eliminates the intra-cranial pressure and black-eye look so typical of sinus inflammation:</p>

<strong><small>The <a href="http://shop.neilmed.com/s.nl/it.A/id.140/.f?sc=2&amp;category=6" target="_blank">NeilMed sinus rinse kit</a>.</small></strong></p>
<h3>The Last Resort&#8211;Heavy Prescription Artillery</h3>
<p>The common cold, as mentioned earlier, is generally thought of as a viral infection and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold" target="_blank">attributed to any number of rhinoviruses and friends</a>:  &#8220;Common colds are most often caused by infection by one of the more than 100 serotypes of rhinovirus, a type of picornavirus. Other viruses causing colds are coronavirus, human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, or metapneumovirus. Due to the many different types of viruses, it is not possible to gain complete immunity to the common cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diverse as the causes might be, there is one combination of drugs&#8211;my personal holy trinity&#8211;that seems to kill off most variations of cold-related upper-respiratory issues if all else fails:</p>

<p><strong>From left to right:</strong>  the &#8220;Zmax&#8221; or <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/azithromycin/article.htm" target="_blank">azithromycin</a>, an antibiotic (don&#8217;t use this and acidophilus at the same time); Flonase or <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/fluticasone_propionate_nasal_inhaler-spray/article.htm" target="_blank">generic fluticasone propionate</a>, an anti-inflammatory nasal stray with little systemic absorption of the glucocorticoids; and <a href="http://www.drugs.com/pseudovent.html" target="_blank">Pseudovent</a>, a decongestant and expectorant not unlike Primatene tablets.</p>
<p>These drugs all have side-effects and should not be used without medical supervision.  If your HMO or doctor seems clueless, however, feel free to make suggestions.  Please note also that I use antibiotics only when warranted, as in the case of severe and recurring sinusitis with related causes.  Uninformed overuse of antibiotics can do more damage than anabolic steroids, so caveat emptor.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The common cold has been with us for millenia and will likely be with us for millenia to come.  Is doesn&#8217;t mean you have to lay down and take it.  Test some of these options, with the guidance of a doctor when needed, and perhaps we can save one more casualty from flu and cold season.</p>

			<p>Doh!  I know it&#8217;s too late to prevent the coming corrections, but I just changed a few &#8220;garlic&#8221;s to &#8220;ginger&#8221;s.  Both have a place in the piece :)</p>

			<p>Tim,</p>
<p>I think you meant to type &#8220;ginger&#8221; the first few times you wrote &#8220;garlic&#8221;. Otherwise, useful ideas &#8211; and garlic can play its part, anyway.</p>
<p>Another inexpensive, low-tech, harmless trick is the &#8220;cold sock treatment&#8221;. I don&#8217;t have time to describe it now, but a little google search will supply the description, I&#8217;m sure.</p>

			<p>Speaking of non-prescriptive drug options, have you ever heard of Cold-FX? <a href="http://www.cold-fx.ca/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cold-fx.ca/</a> It is popular here in Canada; hockey teams endorse it. It&#8217;s supposedly a &#8220;natural&#8221; cure because, according to their FAQ, it &#8220;is a highly purified ChemBioPrint product derived from the roots of North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius).&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used it before, but I don&#8217;t know if it really shortened my cold length but it didn&#8217;t seem to have gone on longer than a normal one.</p>

			<p>Hi there! Really good topic&#8230; :)</p>
<p>Personally, I find that nothing beats herbal tea with honey&#8230; Don&#8217;t know how well the actual effects are documented, but at least it feels good in the throat &#8211; and the soul!</p>
<p>Of course, the best is to prevent the cold.. You can eat lots of fruit and vegetables. But my favourite is to, in the most stubborn way, persuade yourself that you never get sick and tell everybody. That, actually, works wonders&#8230;</p>
<p>Tim, get better!</p>

			<p>Since my wife and I discovered the following a few years ago, her colds have been limited to 24-48 hours max and I have been able to prevent colds completely! THIS WORKS: (by the way, I do not sell this stuff, I buy it &#8230; religiously!) Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils, specifically Oil of Oregano. A few drops taken (mixed in orange juice or milk) as soon as you feel that slight tickle in your throat (or whatever your red flag indicator of the onset of a cold is), will either reverse the onset altogether, (as in my own case and several of my family/friends) or at least mitigate the severity and duration of the cold. (The brand we use is from Young Living as they have the best quality that we’ve been able to find on the planet. Expensive, but worth every red cent.)</p>

			<p>I am a cayenne pepper fan.  It seems as though the Native Americans of the southwest used the stuff on everything and it helped them fight off the common cold that was killing the other NAs.  I put in/on every meal.  Everyone at work has been cold/flu sick twice now and I have not gotten hit once.  It also does wonders for a sore throat, google it.</p>

			<p>The garlic typo leaves me an opening to add the vicious folk remedy I picked up from friends. Exactly the same deal with the ginger, but we don&#8217;t use the orange peel (sounds good though). We squeeze the juice of half a lemon and chop up a couple of cloves of garlic.</p>
<p>When the ginger is steeped enough, put the garlic in the bottom of a mug, pour the ginger tea over the top, then add the lemon juice. We usually add some natural honey &#8211; I could say it&#8217;s for the antibiotic properties, but I think it&#8217;s mostly to reduce it from completely undrinkable to merely hideous :)</p>
<p>Then you slug it down, get a teaspoon and finish all the garlic which has settled to the bottom of the mug.</p>
<p>If I catch a cold in the first few hours, this seems to do the trick. Possibly by simply scaring the living daylights out of any micro-organism that isn&#8217;t physically attached to me&#8230;</p>

			<p>Excellent tip!. I would emphasize though the importance of proper hydration. A technique I was taught about a year ago is to drink six glasses of water (it&#8217;s difficult when you are starting!) first thing in the morning. Then wait about 45 minutes or an hour (while you are getting ready) to eat or drink anything else. Then continue drinking clean pure water the rest of the day as normal. This technique stimulates all the internal organs and brings them rapidly to prime condition. You will feel the difference almost immediately.</p>

			<p>Hey Tim,<br />
Have you experimented with Airborne?  I was advised by a friend to try it when I caught the sniffles coming back from Copenhagen in November.  Seemed to kick the cold, but I dont know much about it other than the label info&#8230; LOTS of vitamins!</p>

			<p>You&#8217;re not seriously recommending azithromycin for the common cold, are you?  Sure, if you have pneumonia, that&#8217;s the way to go, but given how much overprescription of antibiotics has already created new kinds of threats from resistant strains, this seems to be a really terrible piece of advice. If a doctor agrees to write you a script for this on your request, find a doctor who knows what she&#8217;s doing.</p>

			<p>Mr. Ferriss, </p>
<p>I&#8217;m very impressed by your accomplishments, and you are no doubt an intelligent person. But are you SERIOUSLY recommending antibiotics for a cold?!?!</p>
<p>Unless you actually have an accompanying inflammation (such as otitis media or a staph/strep infection), you are doing nothing to combat your symptoms (since colds are viral infections, not bacterial). </p>
<p>Worse, you are basically encouraging further bacterial resistance to already-weak antibiotics. There are two causes of anti-biotic resistant bacterial infections: 1) People failing to finish the prescribed course of antibiotics and stopping administration just as soon as they &#8220;feel better&#8221; and 2) patronizing doctors who throw antibiotics at whiny cold-sufferers who know that they have nothing more than a placebo effect. </p>
<p>In the short term, it&#8217;s probably harmless, but cumulatively, this practice is a serious threat to public health. Shame on you, Mr. Ferriss. </p>
<p>The best cure for a cold? Not getting one. Practice preemptive measures such aimed at sanitation habits instead.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m sure tons of other people will also post their own personal remedies, but it happens to be that my own personal remedies coincide nicely with what you (and other commenters) have stated:</p>
<p>1)  Force yourself to drink 1/2 a gallon of OJ every day you are sick.  This gives you plenty of natural Vitamin C and plenty of fluids, both of which you need badly when you&#8217;re sick.</p>
<p>2)  Wrap yourself in blankets and sleep a fever out.  It&#8217;s hard to sleep and you&#8217;ll be 1/2 awake most of the time, but it works.</p>
<p>Those 2 steps combined have allowed me to recover in 24-48 hours consistently for 8+ years (ever since I tried it in college).  The large quantity of OJ isn&#8217;t that nice in that you&#8217;re taking in tons of sugar, but then again, your appetite probably sucks from being sick and well&#8230; your first priority should be to be in normal health in the first place.</p>

			<p>Nasal irrigation is also well worth practicing when you are in good health. Since colds are rhinovirii, and attach themselves in the upper respiratory tract (read: nose) of a new host, you would do well to keep your nasal passages clear as much as possible. </p>
<p>If you can tolerate the &#8220;water up the nose&#8221; sensation, cup some water in your hands and draw it up through one nostril, far enough so that you can feel it go past your nostrils and up into your nasal cavity.  Tilt your head up to allow for it to irrigate the cavity, then blow it out. Repeat with your other nostril.  </p>
<p>Making the water saline helps with the unpleasant &#8220;water up the nose&#8221; sensation. An isotonic saline balance will prevent that reaction. </p>
<p>Look for &#8220;neti pots&#8221; at your local health food store or online; they&#8217;re an Ayurvedic tool to irrigate your nasal passages, and make the process I suggested above a little more dignified. </p>
<p>Get in the habit of doing this every time you go to the bathroom and wash your hands. I&#8217;m a third year law student with a newborn and haven&#8217;t been able to concentrate on physical fitness for almost three years, but I&#8217;ve been cold-free for well over a year now, and (although this is only anecdotal evidence), I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s all because of &#8220;keeping my nose clean&#8221;!</p>

			<p>hey, love the book,  ( wit and humour) however i have a Q? will you tell me how an uneducated fool like myself (40 years old now trapped in retail working some mornings &#8216;opening the store&#8217; and some evenings<br />
 &#8216;closing the store &#8216;) can make the 4 hour work week happen? I don&#8217;t dream of retail. I have better imagination than that, but this is  only paying enough to get me by. I saw tim&#8217;s book in the book store( in the mall that i work at) and instead   of spending my lunch money on lunch, i bot  his book &#8220;the 4-hour work week&#8221; will this work for me? I want totravel the world ( haven&#8217;t seen much of it, but alway&#8217;s dreamed of seeing antartica, just to say that i was there.  thank you. randy</p>

			<p>Great ideas!  I love this post&#8230;Beating the common cold can be harder than beating cancer.  And this post has some great pointers.  As a chemist, I especially appreciate the garlic referral &#8211; Big Pharma has been desperate to make a synthetic copy cat for about 15 years&#8230;Garlique is a great brand available for less than ten bucks/month at Wal-Mart.  and you can boost its effectiveness without having to resort to the risky Zmax stack&#8230;Combine garlique with the adaptogen andrographis (see wholefoods.com)!</p>
<p>Whether you are fighting flu, getting over whooping cough, or warding off the next Super Bug, adaptogens are your key to beating them!  </p>
<p>Andrographis was first used for its success in treating snakebites and overcoming malaria and dysentery.  It is considered to be especially effective in clearing heat from the body and blood and is commonly used in treating heart conditions which include infection in the lungs, urinary tract, and throat – think strep throat.  Within the halls of Big Pharma, modern research has proven andrographis to be beneficial at removing blood clots, stopping the spread of multiple types of cancer, and increasing the amount of immune enhancing white blood cells.  Its active ingredients have been identified as andrographolides.  The Journal of Ethnopharmacology recently showed andrographis to be more effective than the well known astragalus and echinichea for warding off the flu.</p>

			<p>Way to go, Tim. You did an excellent job of describing many of the homeopathic and modern medicinal treatments for the common colds. </p>
<p>One you did not mention, is Zinc gluconate glycine, a combination of zinc gluconate and glycine (an amino acid). It is available, generally, as lozenges and is an over-the-counter remedy for the common cold. Zinc gluconate glycine has been shown in clinical trials to shorten the duration of symptoms of the common cold.</p>
<p>Be careful, though, do not continue to use the lozenges once you have started any antibiotic therapy, as it is believed to inhibit it&#8217;s effectiveness.</p>
<p>By the way, Tim, I wrote in the 4-hour work week (new addition suggestions chapter 13 blog) that I would like to challenge you, when you are better of course, to teaching me very specific techniques via email and maybe a phone conversation or two, so that this critical care nurse can become a true 4 hour work weeker and stay home more with her special needs son (Brandon has Down Syndrome and is 8 years old). Later, I would appreciate, along with Ian Sanderson (who also posted to same blog), the opportunity to  help create or be a part of  the  4 hour work week consultation organization that Ian recommends. What do you think?</p>

<p>Thank you for the comment.  I very unfortunately cannot offer one-on-one advising due to the volume of requests (100s per week), but I&#8217;m sure with the book and forum and your own smarts, you can figure out a plan that will work for you and your son.</p>
<p>At this time, I am holding off on a consulting organization because quality assurance would become a big headache and I have other projects on my plate, but this could change.</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck!</p>
<p>Tim</p>

			<p>Awesome post Tim, and very topical. Being of German descent, I also strongly recommend the traditional Hot Toddy (rum, hot water, and honey). </p>
<p>I also thought I&#8217;d link-drop this on ya as a great place for a mini-retirement: <a href="http://gizmodo.com/367835/bellavista-rainforest-treehouse-community-is-endor-on-earth" rel="nofollow">http://gizmodo.com/367835/bellavista-rainforest-treehouse-community-is-endor-on-earth</a></p>

			<p>Hey Tim,</p>
<p>Good stuff. I know some doctors will prescribe antibiotics for the common cold!! How illiterate do you have to be to prescribe antibiotics for a viral infection? I have tried the whole supplement thing and can totally vouch for Vitamin C.</p>
<p>The trouble is people just don&#8217;t take enough of it!! And if your body is weak, as it is during a cold, you&#8217;re going to need more vitamin C. A good rule of thumb is to take enough C to saturate the body. Saturation is reached when you get diarrhea :)</p>
<p>Oh yeah and prepare for a lot of flatulence that day, so it&#8217;s wise to stay home. The last few time I&#8217;ve done this, I&#8217;ve gotten over the major symptoms of cold in no more than 48 hours. It has taken me up to 20-30 grams of vitamin C a day to get over it, and I&#8217;m usually normally functioning the next day.</p>
<p>The problem with things like OJ, is that to get the same effect from it you have to drink a LOT</p>

			<p>My finance is originally from Mexico. Her family&#8217;s solution begins with boiling water with ginger and garlic and finishing it with honey. Sounds bad, but is actually kinda tasty and seems to help. </p>
<p>All of our Mexican friends (and Cuban, Puerto RIcan and Russian) seemed sure that a shot of tequila, rum, or vodka would cure my ills. Not sure if it helped the cold, but I felt pretty good for at least a few hours.</p>

			<p>Tim,<br />
You can avoid it all with quality vitamins and minerals (and no, not the crap you get at GNC or the other stores&#8230;). I&#8217;ve managed to get rid of my lifelong allergies (pneumonia twice a year EVERY year) in the last 4 weeks. The trees and flowers all started blooming in VA on Monday&#8230;and I was..unaffected for the first time, ever.</p>
<p>Hah, 4 weeks&#8230;just realized the karma there.</p>

			<p>I found the following usually ensures my cold vanishes within 48-72:</p>
<p>- two packages of TheraFlu with hot tea and honey, twice a day<br />
(I usually put it in a huge cup and add a healthy pour of Whiskey if I am working from home)</p>
<p>- 1000 mg of C, twice a day<br />
- 1000 mcg of B12, twice a day</p>
<p>Basically, I think the large amounts of acetaminophen and vitamins shock the system and prevent the cold germies from getting a foothold.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it doesn&#8217;t kill them, just allows the body to fight them off?</p>
<p>I usually imagine this is the case, since it helps me mentally fight off the cold, I absolutely hate getting a cold.</p>

			<p>This I believe is a chinese recipe.  </p>
<p>Here is a formula to keep on hand.<br />
Three spoons of cayanne pepper powder, one small handfull of crushed red pepper, one large ginger root freshly grated. Place in a quart jar and fill w/ vodka. Let steep for three weeks. At the first sign of the cold or flu, take one spoonfull and mix it into a cup of water that is as hot as you can tollerate drinking, drink it it down as fast as possible.  </p>
<p>thanks</p>

			<p>Tim &#8211; I like your suggestions except my feedback from patients about Airborne and Zicam has been less than stellar. My personal favorite remedies include oregano, olive leaf extract, Argentyn colloidal silver,and vitamin C. I think prevention is key, meaning a strong fast-responding immune system. Beta-glucan has helped me avoid many of the bugs my patients bring me each winter. So has having an adequate level of Vitamin D3 in my system.<br />
It&#8217;s important for everyone to recognize the symptoms of influenza, which has been very prevalent this season, because this virus can still be shut down rapidly with a prescription product Tamiflu. </p>

			<p>I have a personal experience warning about Melatonin.  I was given half a pill once as a &#8220;natural way to get to sleep&#8221; when I was sick.  Around 2am I woke up shaking uncontrollably.  </p>
<p>After checking the web, I found Melatonin can cause seizures in some users.</p>

			<p>I second (or third or forth) NETI POT. Swear by it. Got myself and whole fam off antihistimines.</p>
<p>Also, homeopoathic remedy that works &gt;&gt;&gt; ZICAM<br />
Available almost all stores. The Trick? At first onset (within 24 hours) of that stuffy nose and/or scratchy throat feeling (not allergies) take as directed, and GO TO BED -but just ONE DAY and you are up and at &#8216;em again. Key is starting it at first symptoms and resting. Add the neti pot for stuffy nose relief. It&#8217;s miraculous.</p>

			<p>Followup to Rob Hinchcliffe&#8230;.I&#8217;ve been experimenting successfully with 1000mg of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (an acetylated amino acid) plus 500mg of Vit. C right before you start drinking booze and after the session is over.  The proposed mode of action is that these two together scavenge the acetaldehyde which is a by-product of alchohol breakdown &#8212; acetaldehyde the molecule that most people think is a major headache cause for hangovers.  You could also add half an ibuprofen tablet to the mix before you drink but beware if you have a sensitive stomach to NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen etc).  Avoid acetaminophen (tylenol) when drinking because it can amplify liver damage.</p>

			<p>Hi Tim</p>
<p>I know this is off the topic of your post, but I recently listened to your interview with Yanik Silver. Brilliant mate you are a genius! </p>
<p>My question is if the interview you done with Jack, the author of Chicken soup..&#8221; is still available? I&#8217;d very much appreciate it if I could get my hands on it</p>
<p>Thanks Tim</p>
<p>Ben</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>Not for now, I&#8217;m afraid.  That was an exclusive offer made a few months ago.  I may reappear, and if so, I imagine I&#8217;ll announce it here on the blog.</p>
<p>Thx!</p>
<p>Tim</p>

			<p>As mentioned previously, a neti pot is the simplest and most comfortable way to perform sinus irrigation. Originated in India, a small ceramic pot has a long spout which is inserted in the nostril. The head is tilted to the opposite side, and a mild saline solution is flushed through the nose and expelled through the other nostril.</p>
<p>Try it. I guarantee you won&#8217;t go back to other messy means.</p>

			<p>The ginger stuff tastes waaay better, and still works wonders, when you </p>
<p>a. let it simmer for about 4-5 hours (if you have the patience)</p>
<p>b. add tons of honey (which has its own role in many cold remedies, so it helps you while making the drink more palatable)</p>
<p>c. add lemon juice instead of orange peel (which I suspect is the main reason your version tastes horrible)</p>
<p>This way, you end up with a sort of hot, spicy lemonade.</p>

			<p>Hey all,  </p>
<p>I have a cure that may put some hair on your chest(s) but it is astonishing how well it works.  When u feel the cold coming on or are even at the sore throat stage &#8211; one tablespoon and &#8211; bam.  </p>
<p>We call it &#8220;missionary medicine&#8221;, named after the missionaries to Albania we got the recipe from.   A friend later found a similar recipe in a Mennonite women&#8217;s magazine.</p>
<p>Take about a quart of raw cider vinegar (must be raw for proper fermentation to occurr &#8211; you&#8217;ll see the filmy &#8220;mother&#8221; in it) and add about a cup each of pref chemical free chopped: garlic, ginger, horseradish, and hot peppers.  Decant to glass jars.  Let sit out for about 2 weeks, then u can strain the pulp out if u want (although we don&#8217;t) before storing the jars in fridge.  This amount should last u all winter by the way, so i usually make it up in October timeframe.  </p>
<p>When u feel the cold coming on, take 1 tablespoon of this every waking hour.  You&#8217;ll shudder and your teeth will vibrate but it is truly amazing how the stuff blasts the cold right out of your system.  Sore throat &#8211; gone instantly.  Sinuses clear (how could they not be).  You should only need to take this for a day , day and a half to nip your cold in the bud.  I&#8217;ve been doing this for 3 years now and it has prevented 6 out of 7 colds.  </p>
<p>My husband is completely traumatized by this treatment this by the way ;)  He tried it once and he says he&#8217;d rather just have the cold!!  I actually don&#8217;t think its that bad if u hold your nose and have a &#8220;chaser&#8221; nearby (ex: plain cracker, piece of banana, etc).  When I get a cold it always ends up with hacking cough for weeks and weeks on end so for me this treatment is SOOOO worth it!</p>
<p>Dare</p>
<p>PS Tim &#8211; thanks for your book, which I listened to on cd last summer.  I run a couple side businesses in addition to my day job (not to mention how BZ I am raising a 3 yr old and traumatizing my husband with scary folk doctor witch medicine home remedies ;)  I got so many useful tips from 4HWW.  I don&#8217;t think I could have done it without u!</p>

			<p>The cure that I&#8217;ve recently found and works amazingly well is the 3 S&#8217;s.  This came from a fellow Toastmaster member who is a budding homeopath.</p>
<p>1.  (S)ambucol:  It is an extract from the black elderberry that you can find in Syrup form at CVS and Rite-Aid.  It&#8217;s a centuries old remedy that works with upper respiratory issues.<br />
2.  (S)eed extract from Grapefruit:  Find it at natural food stores.  It is toxic to the bacteria from colds but not to the body in the low doses that the pills provide.  Great for sinus issues.<br />
3.  (S)oup &#8211; Chicken:  Mom always knows best and get some made with the chicken bones in the stock served piping hot.</p>
<p>Good luck Tim.</p>

			<p>Hi Tim!<br />
The Chinese are right&#8230;.sweat it out.  Another great way to induce diaphoresis  is through the &#8220;Hot Toddy&#8221; &#8211; mix 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice with 1 tablespoon of honey in a glass.  Add 1 tablespoon of warmed whiskey, brandy or rum, stir and drink.  Works like a charm and tastes pretty darn good!</p>

			<p>Actually Tim, I&#8217;m glad you mentioned ALA &#8211; always take ALA with high doses (500-1000mg) of Vitamin C because it will help increase the body&#8217;s ability to take in Vitamin C exponentially (especially when sick). This is why so many articles say that Vitamin C doesn&#8217;t work. Most people can&#8217;t absorb enough without a absorbsion catalyst like ALA. It really does work if done right.</p>
<p>400 mg of ALA taken daily also acts as a mild laxative if you need that sort of help. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing how you use it.</p>

			<p>Two points &#8211; from over use of the antibiotic azithromycin, it has experienced increasing resistance from the bacteria usually associated with sinus infection.  The recommended dose is now 2 grams.  The usual pack is 1.5 grams.  The new Zmax is a bottle of 2 grams liquid as a single dose.</p>
<p>The reason your infections respond so quickly is the irrigation.  it is very important.  The saline solution does not penetrate the sinuses according to a recent study, but it none-the-less helps the immune system to respond and aids in antibiotic effectiveness.</p>

			<p>Dear Tim,</p>
<p>Most definitely get a nettipot they  will help clear the sinuses but will be rather gross to begin with, and will take a lot of the gases from the nasal passages. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d advocate changing your body temperature too, cold bath, hot shower etc, to encourage the flow of toxins out of your body. If you do opt for the medication all you are doing is putting more toxins into your body thus just prolonging your agony in the long term. Sauna&#8217;s are fab for this!! </p>
<p>The best thing I did, when I was very poorly earlier this year is to have a ginger bath&#8230; draw the hottest bath possible, and get some ginger and slice it up a good bunch here we are talking and then lie in the bath for at least 40minutes, best to do this before you go to sleep, and then lay several towels on your bed before you lay down as the ginger coupled with the heat with stimulate your system to detoxify and it will feel v. relaxing and soothing and you will start to feel better, I am sure:)</p>
<p>Magnesium will help too, in moving things along. But I strongly, advocate ginger it&#8217;s amazing at encouraging toxins to move along.</p>
<p>Any kind of massage too that you could endure be it an indian head one, to<br />
even a foot massage, will help the toxins move along; given that our biggest organ is our skin.</p>
<p>Take it gently, it seems you are being forced to:)</p>
<p>Namaste,</p>
<p>Carriex</p>

			<p>You have a C supplement listed.  Which I&#8217;m also a huge proponent of &#8211; if nothing else I figure the placebo effect is worth it. However, instead of the straight C dose, I do a C/B combo. </p>
<p>Typically one of the heavy dose complexes, one I like a lot is the Stress B-Complex companies like Nature Made put out. </p>
<p>My reasoning: In addition to the C, upping metabolism should help offset a relative loss of appetite and feeling of lethargy. </p>
<p>NO proof to support it what so ever, but /shrug seems to help a lot.  </p>
<p>Also, consider using Olive Leaf (ground in capsul form) to dry up your nose. I find that it works well.</p>

			<p>Tim, </p>
<p>Great information here, I am a teacher so I am always exposed to viruses as you can imagine. Although, I noticed you are taking the &#8220;Cardiovascular&#8221; Kyolic. I use the Formula 103 which is the &#8220;Immunity&#8221; blend. I am not sure that it would make a difference since they are essentially both Garlic Products, but there are some extras that aide in the recovery that the Cardiovascular version may not. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

			<p>I really appreciate seeing all these ideas here. There is no such thing as too many arrows in your quiver when it comes to fighting for good health!</p>
<p>My problem is also seasonal &#8211; allergies. The bartlet pear trees are blooming here in NC, and thus my sneezing begins. It doesn&#8217;t get really bad though until the oaks starts to bloom.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done shots, every prescription solution I could find and all sorts of natural remedies, but nothing seems to work. Anyone have any great solutions?</p>

			<p>I know there are a million and one cold remedies out there, but let me give you this one. As preventative maintenance, eat one apple daily, every morning before you eat ANYTHING else. Not only does it seem to jumpstart your digestive system, but I have been cold and flu free since starting this 3 years ago. I prefer Fugi apples and Pink Ladies, but I&#8217;m sure personal preference does not matter.</p>
<p>I would like to know someday when we have the technology what phytonutients an apple truly contains.</p>
<p>I guess the old saying &#8220;an apple a day&#8230;..&#8221; does really work.</p>

			<p>Hey Tim,</p>
<p>Just found your book and love it!  I have been living the life for 3 years now.  I am was a massage therapist but had a big talent for endurance sports and decided that I was going to find a way to quit my job, move to New Zealand in the American winter and Boulder, CO in the American summer to train full time for Ironman Triathlon.  </p>
<p>I made that happen (and no I am not rich) and now I am getting ready to start my first season racing pro.  While I begin my first year as a pro I decided to do something good with my triathlon adventure.  So I started a fundraising team for The Matthew Shepard Foundation called Team E-Race Hate.</p>
<p>Even though I would say that I am very &#8220;gifted&#8221; when it comes to finding ways of &#8220;living the life&#8221; , I find that your book will help me 10 times over while in the process of building this network of fundraising triathletes and marathoners.</p>
<p>I decided to write to your blog as one of the exercises in the book and see if I can get you to contact me.  I don&#8217;t need to ask you a question so   I figured if you made a donation to my personal fundrasing page that would be my answer.</p>
<p>I have enclosed it in the Website link.  </p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
bdc<br />
P.S.- A Neti pot is a great tool to prevent getting colds.</p>

			<p>How you pump out such quality content all the time I have no idea.</p>
<p>Anyways since I had nowhere else to ask you this, do you offer any sort of affiliate program for your pxmethod?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to promote it for you, make us both a little money.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Hi Sweeney,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the kind words.  Since the PX Method page is just a mock-up for people to see as an example and not a live sales page, there is no affiliate program at the moment, but I&#8217;ll announce on the blog if this ever changes.</p>

I&#8217;ve had one full blown cold in the past three years &#8211; but otherwise I believe it can forestall or eliminate colds. I like your recipes and will try the Chinese anti-cold cocktail next time a feel a cold coming on. Thanks!</p>

			<p>Hi Joe -</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have allergies so can&#8217;t speak from personal experience, but as an amateur herbalist I&#8217;ve seen a lot of success with freeze-dried nettles capsules for their anti-histamine effect. Try any of the major health food stores, or my friends at <a href="http://www.chakra4herbs.com/Nettle-Leaf-Capsules-Fresh-Freeze-Dried-Organic-p/c-nettlelf-fd.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chakra4herbs.com/Nettle-Leaf-Capsules-Fresh-Freeze-Dried-Organic-p/c-nettlelf-fd.htm</a>.

			<p>My &#8220;cold remedy&#8221; came about while in Chiropractic College. I used to get sinus infection and colds so bad i would be knocked out for 2-3 weeks every year.  While in college and learning how much effect the nervous system controls the immune system.  When i started to get that worn down or felt a cold coming on i would get checked 3-5 times in a day. Sometimes getting adjusted every time. Along with this i would drink about 3 smoothies with fruit and whey protein, take a few grams of Vitamin C and about 5 grams of Fish Oil. </p>
<p>What used to kick me on the tail for weeks now I&#8217;m over in a day! I practice in OH now and haven&#8217;t been sick in 2 years.  Also most Chiropractors won&#8217;t charge extra to see you multiple times in the same day. FYI</p>

			<p>Hi Tim:  </p>
<p>Might I suggest checking into the immune enhancing benefits of keeping a clear nervous system through chiropractic care?  And maybe shift some of your ideas around about how you need to catch colds in the first place?  Sometimes they are useful for the body to shed off cells it doesn&#8217;t need anymore (as a product of daily cellular replacement),&#8230;.but people don&#8217;t need to get sick nearly as much as they think.  Really.  It&#8217;s yet another personal perceived limitation that can be broken- it just must be a harder box for you to find and break through since it is so culturally engrained.</p>
<p>If you need some city referrals I can help!  </p>

			<p>Ginger works in a way but not so much. Heres what my moma gives me(southern chinese) which works for me. At most herbal place. they sell this type of tea which is box tea aka. luang chai in chinese and because im American Born Chinese I don&#8217;t know the exact translation for such but anyways. This tea comes in a set of 6 which is rolled up in  balls on a leaf. (all you chinese people help a brother out in discription)Well the whole point is to drink the tea and wrap yourself in some warm blanket so you sweat the bad stuff away and wake up refreshed and cold-free. Thats my one night  chinese way.</p>

			<p>I usually boil ginger in water, strain and use that water for a ginger / mint herbal tea.  It helps make the taste a little more palatable.</p>
<p>Interesting sidenote, I broke a tooth near Christmas and due to the holidays had to wait a week for a dentist appointment.  The same ginger tea concoction worked really well to combat the toothache.</p>

			<p>I second Lea&#8217;s comments about Cold-FX.</p>
<p>A recent article in Nutrition Action magazine claimed that it was the only non-prescription &#8220;supplement&#8221; where valid studies backed up a decrease in both severity and duration of colds.</p>
<p>Since I started using it about a year ago, I&#8217;ve only had one (short) cold, as opposed to an average of about 2-3/year beforehand.</p>

			<p>Tim,<br />
My two germ-factory kids and my wife think I have superhuman immunity to clds. Mine last 1 or 2 days and theirs can reinfect for weeks.I don&#8217;t get sinusitis (from the cold anyway), sore throats, infections, coughs or post nasal drips, I think  because I&#8217;m not draining in my throat. The reason? I have long suspected that Flonase and my addition to spray decongestants (a tool of the devil, except in this case) along with the occassional sudafed has prevented the misery. Anyone else have this experience?</p>
<p>FYI try to stay away from afrin, etc. I&#8217;m convinced it produced by the drug companies precidely to addict users. Just when you thought you kicked it&#8230;.</p>

			<p>I travel a ton for work and cannot afford the luxury of being down and out. My cure (this gets me back and healthy within 24-48 hours) that allows me to continue to work and travel and minimize the symptoms to almost non noticable is:</p>
<p>at initial onset of symptoms (sore throat, sinus congestion or hot forehead/headache) I do the following:</p>
<p>I will drink 64 ounces of water per day (you have to pee a ton but it is well worth it to boost your bodies ability to fight the cold)<br />
I will take 500 mg of vitamin C in the morning, lunch and dinner<br />
I will get sudafed daytiime 24 hour (the kind you have to sign for behind the counter)<br />
Menthol lozenges to sooth the throat and clear the sinus, as needed.</p>
<p>Has worked for me.</p>

			<p>This is more of a prevention than a cure. I used to catch all the colds in town. What works for me in terms of prevention is eating at least 3 oranges a day during the cold season. I don&#8217;t catch the flu, I don&#8217;t catch the colds. Skip the oranges a few days and bam, I get one.<br />
And when I do catch one, aspirin, hot tea, a lot of blankets and sweat shortens the cold.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Ginger Tea&#8221; is actually quite popular and you can order it in most Asian tea shops.  I think it&#8217;s pretty drinkable if it is sweetened (my girly-man stomach loves a dollop of honey with ginger tea)</p>

			<p>Hey Tim,</p>
<p>I noticed that you use an electric stovetop! Would it not be more efficient if you switched over to an induction cooktop? They boil water as fast as gas ranges and use much less electricity than the conventional electric stovetops. Also, you could set the time, so that if you fell asleep in your Epsom Salt bath, it wouldn&#8217;t boil out (and even if you forgot to set the timer and left it, the cooktop will detect that all liquid is gone somehow, and turn off). It&#8217;s all about efficiency and effectiveness, ain&#8217;t it?</p>

			<p>There are so many great comments although I have found that the best way to get ride of a cold is to talk and think it out of me. If I feel a cold comming on which happens (I live in Wisconsin), I starting telling myself how great I feel and I never ever give any energy to feeling bad. Although I may in actuality not feel very well for a day my colds go away within a day a or two. Before I started this I would have colds constantly in the winter and I would feed them with my thinking about how bad I felt. In the past 3 years or so I hardly evey feel ill and if I do it goes away very quickly. Drink a glass of water and tell yourself I feel great. Mind over matter.<br />
Good Health to all.<br />

			<p>Tim,</p>
<p>Great post! I hope you&#8217;re already feeling better. I think the below info will be useful for you, as your travelling schedule probably resembles mine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m spending 24+ hours on longhaul flights twice a month, breathing recycled air and being surrounded by coughing and sneezing people. In the past I would catch colds and flu&#8217;s so frequently that I ended up dreading flying to the point that I nearly gave up my otherwise dream lifestyle. </p>
<p>My friend Natalia (a former international model, pianist and creator of Employment Advantage, an online training program to <a href="http://www.employmentadvantage.com.au" rel="nofollow">help people score the job of their dreams</a>) has totally changed my life by sharing her secret of how to survive exposure to germ danger zones, like crowded conventions with bad airconditioning, longhaul flights etc, and emerge totally unscathed:</p>
<p>    1) Anywhere you go always take a flask of no-rinse antibacterial hand gel with you. </p>
<p>E.g. Aqium, Dettol etc. Use liberally every time after someone who has the sniffles shakes your hands, you touch public banisters, doorhandles, etc. Of course, people who have a cold shouldn&#8217;t shake hands or touch public banisters in the first place. But, unfortunately, they do, and therefore you have to defend yourself. It&#8217;s important to do this within minutes of exposure. If you&#8217;re waiting until the next convenient opportunity to go to the bathroom and wash your hands the traditional way, it will be too late. </p>
<p>    2) Always carry a small bottle of First Defense (antibacterial nasal spray) with you. </p>
<p>Use this the minute someone coughs or sniffles in your general direction. If you&#8217;re in a room where lots of germs fly around, use at least once every couple of hours. The application hurts a little bit, but is well worth it.</p>
<p>    3) Never ever touch your face with anything other than freshly sanitized hands.  </p>
<p>This sounds like a no-brainer, but if you observe yourself, you&#8217;ll be surprised how often you are absentmindedly touching your face. It takes a while to shed the habit, but can be done, particularly if you regularly remind yourself of the benefits of never getting another cold.</p>
<p>    4) Drink loads of water.</p>
<p>This point has already been elaborated on in previous posts.</p>
<p>After implementing this regimen I have been cold-free for a year. No matter where I go, I still carry an emergency supply of several of the remedies mentioned by yourself and others above, but haven&#8217;t needed them.</p>
<p>Good Luck!<br />
Stef</p>

			<p>I really like the Chinese acient cure. It reminds of something that a friend once told me to try and I think it actually worked!</p>
<p>The food thing with this type of cure is that as they do not contain any medicine there are cannot be any really side affects.</p>
<p>Since I do not drink I think I will try this remedy out ( got a bit of a sniffle today ).</p>

			<p>I love Echinacea Supreme tincture by Gaia to boost my immune system. Squirting a dropperful under the tongue once every two hours helps to either ward the cold off or lesson the impact of the symptoms of a cold. This technique is for experienced herbal remedy explorers as the taste is super intense and it makes you salivate immediately. Echinacea will only trigger the immune response for 8 to 10 days at a time.</p>
<p>Super fave Probiotic is Bio-K. Bio-K comes in a yogurt type form and I feel like my body absorbs the live cultures best with this product. I was a buyer in the supplement section of Whole Foods for two years and I have tried countless products.</p>
<p>Love the topic!</p>
<p>Happy Springtime</p>

			<p>I can certainly empathize with this post as I&#8217;m just getting over a bizarre cold/flu (I never decided which it was except it was persistent) that has lasted over 2 weeks. It&#8217;s been gripping everybody here at the office and staying for weeks with each unhappy host.</p>
<p>Anyway, while I certainly didn&#8217;t manage to cut it short, I was able to minimize the congestion factor a great deal. (I only went through a single box of kleenex during a 2 week cold.)  I wasn&#8217;t nearly as successful staving off  the body ache, the cough or the killer headache that lingered, and my throat kept trying to get raw. (It would get raw and dry and then I&#8217;d nip it in the bud, then it would start getting raw again.) </p>
<p>Anyway, here are some of my tricks:</p>
<p>&#8211; I drank a LOT of Emergen-C, several packets a day. The stuff is great.  I also ate a lot of fresh fruit.</p>
<p>&#8211; I drank a lot of herb tea &#8212; I was constantly sipping tea. I like two brands you can get in the health food section: Respiratory Relief (it really does keep the chest mucus down) and Throat Coat, which is licorice and slippery elm bark tea. Even a single cup of slippery elm tea really does wonders for a bad throat.</p>
<p>&#8211; I slept a lot. And bundled up in extra blankets, so much so that it induced a sweat several times.</p>
<p>&#8211; I practiced lymph drainage massage on my sinuses. I got a &#8220;cold recovery&#8221; massage last year where the lady also did lymph massage, and I remembered where she manipulated. So whenever my sinuses started to threaten to close up, I did the lymph massage thing to help clear the stuff out faster. I&#8217;m not an expert on lymph massage but this worked for me.</p>
<p>Basically you start at about the middle of the lower eye socket and press down in a semi circle so that you end up pressing deeply into the sinuses right about where the cartilate of your nose meets the bone. If your sinuses are normal, it will be hard for you to tell the right spot but if they are in bad shape it&#8217;s fairly easy to figure out the spot. If you do it right, you should feel liquid oozing into your nasal passage or down your throat. It can help to lay back or tilt your head back to resist gravity.</p>

			<p>Tim,</p>
<p>Have you tried the R-Isomer form of ALA (i.e. without the synthetic S-Isomer &#8211; which has shown in studies to inhibit the natural potent R-Isomer)?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s conveniently called, R-ALA.</p>
<p>If you really want to avoid the common cold, I highly advise introducing (if you haven&#8217;t already) cruciferous vegetables and sprouts (especially broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and broccoli sprouts &#8211; preferably raw &#8211; make sure you eat them with food so they are somewhat more palatable).</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t emphasize the numerous benefits I have reaped as a result of implementing these foods into my diet.</p>

			<p>I forgot to add, if you are going to take vitamin C, I advise taking the vitamin C supplement magnesium ascorbate &#8211; it is less acidic as it is bound to magnesium (alkaline mineral) &#8211; unlike ascorbic acid which is very acid!</p>
<p>Also, raw broccoli is so dense with vitamin C!  Just 2 florets equal approximately 45% of ones RDI!</p>

			<p>I have not had the flu or colds anymore in about 4  years ( well for one thing, I quit getting those unhealthy flu shots!)The moment I begin to feel just a bit of the sniffles or something wanting to start, I use Airborne. I also take it  throughout the year if I am going to be in crowded places.<br />
  I also always clean off shopping cart handles :)<br />
My husband, who is older, also takes it, does not get flu shots, and does not get colds anymore either. Airborne, as I am sure you know, is natural, and yes, it does have , among other ingredients, Euchinasea. I tell everyone about it, cuz it works!</p>

			<p>I haven&#8217;t had a cold or the flu in years except for some occasions when visiting grandchildren; probably no immunity to their germssince we don;tlive close.  When that happens, I take two aspirin and 500 mg. Vit. C, &#8211; four hours later the same.  Usually it takes only two doses.</p>

			<p>Here is a recipe my husband uses who use to have sinus infection for 15 years and taking antibiotics every other month.<br />
Fill a glass with warm water, dissolve 2 tea spoons of sea salt and breathe water through the nose and spit out though your mouth. Bend and wait until all water comes out of the nose. He does this every day and never has sinus infection for last 3 years. If he gets a cold then after procedure with the nose he sprays silver water and still avoids sinus infection. For my kids, sambucol,umcka and airborne works like a charm. Hope this helps.</p>

			<p>THis is my 2nd post. My first one I should&#8217;ve posted under Dance, but I think I accidentally posted it under your most recent blog on GOING GREEN. </p>
<p>I forgot to add this so this time it should be posted under the correct topic! Hopefully the moderator will post it correctly. But then will you read them if posted other than the most recent blog?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been into holistic medicine for over 20 yrs. My husband has been getting a lot of colds recently. He has a history of bronchitis so bad that he had to skip a whole year of school as a kid. Now he just gets colds. I hardly catch anything. This last one even I had to fight it. I didn&#8217;t have the drainage just itchy throat and muscle aches. But we tried everything&#8230;Homeopathic Zicam (good if catch at the beginning), NOW&#8217;s Golden Seal/Echinachea, NOW&#8217;s Garlic, Orange peels also from our tree and some ginger too but not like how you described. WE do the baths also but not the whole box so next time will do that also! We also tried Nature Sunshine&#8217;s garlic and VSC. The VSC (Chinese herbs) seemed to help me. I&#8217;m sure all did. But this formula seemed to do the best for ALan:  </p>

<p>Don&#8217;t know if you heard of Dr Christopher&#8217;s formulas?</p>
<p>It says: (can delete this if comment too long:)<br />
Chest Formula contains: Bayberry Bark, Cloves, Ginger Root, Cayenne and White Pine Bark. All encapsulated products are in a pure 100% vegetable based capsule.</p>
<p>Chest Formula is effective in breaking up colds, flu, etc.</p>
<p> As a remedy in colds, beginning of fevers, flu, hoarseness, sluggish circulation, colic, cramps, etc. We believe it has done more good than any other single preparation ever known to man. If this compound were kept in every home, and used as the occasion arose, there would be far less sickness. </p>
<p>Give it freely in your practice and your patient will bless you. Look over the ingredients, and consider how it will clear canker, ease cramps and pains in the stomach and bowels, raise the heat of the body equalizing the circulation, and remove congestions. It is safe. It is effective. We have on numberless occasions given a cup of composition tea every hour as warm as the patient could drink it, until the patient has perspired freely, and after four or five doses have seen our patient in a free perspiration, thereby removing colds and febrile trouble.” This Composition Powder is safe for anyone, children and adults alike; it’s very effective in breaking up colds, flu, etc. All encapsulated products are in a pure 100% vegetable based capsule.</p>

			<p>Hey, you recommend using azithromycin for a cold but I think that is a bad idea. It has no affect on viruses (i.e. colds) and can even be a bit of a bad idea what with the resistance bacteria build to each exposure of antibiotic.</p>
<p>Better to load up on the ginger root/orange peel tea with Vitamin C (the pill, not the singer&#8230; that would just make the pain worse) and get some rest. I throw continuous cups of green tea at it as well (Dragon&#8217;s Well tea from Hangzhou, China. The best green tea on the planet) which seems to make a difference.</p>

			<p>Wow the ginger and orange peel works! I&#8217;m drinking the last of it right now and already I feel so much better. It is really gross! Tastes like I&#8217;m drinking liquid pepper (at least that&#8217;s what I taste with my cold). After the first half dozen sips my nose stopped running, a few more sips and my sore throat went away. After a half a cup my sinuses started clearing up.. this is something the doses of over the counter medication didn&#8217;t do! </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to doubly dread getting a cold now because I not only feel sick, I know the cure involves drinking liquid fire! :) Thanks Tim</p>

			<p>Great info, Tim!  I am lucky enough to guzzle Emergen-C for a few days and be fine.  My dad however, has suffered immensely from sinus problems for decades.  He&#8217;s allergic to pretty much every plant, pollen and tree known to man.  Going into his 3rd sinus surgery, he found a doctor using more accurate laser technology along with CAT scan measurements and has been great ever since.  If you&#8217;d like more information, let me know, and thanks for the recipes!</p>

			<p>Another common cold/flu/sore throaT cure: feel a cold coming on take 100,000 iu of Vitamin A gels; 1-3,000mg vitamin C; and 15-50 mg Zinc at bedtime&#8230;&#8230;..pregnant womena use reduced Vit.A dosages 20,000&#8230;&#8230;.the next day if symptoms not gone continue each day.<br />
Works even if you missed the sublte onset signs of the illness&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>best to you Uncle Tim.</p>
<p>________________________________________________________<br />
Vitamin A Dosage</p>
<p>We have pointed out that concerns about vitamin A toxicity are exaggerated. While some forms of synthetic vitamin A found in supplements can be toxic at only moderately high doses, fat-soluble vitamin A naturally found in foods like cod liver oil, liver, and butterfat is safe at up to ten times the doses of water-soluble, solidified, and emulsified vitamin A found in some supplements that produce toxicity.(1) Additionally, the vitamin D found in cod liver oil and butterfat from pasture-raised animals protects against vitamin A toxicity, and allows one to consume a much higher amount of vitamin A before it becomes toxic.(1-3) Liver from land mammals is high in vitamin A but low in vitamin D, and should therefore be consumed with other vitamin D-rich foods such as lard or bacon from pasture-raised pigs, egg yolks, and oily fish, or during months in which UV-B light is sufficient to provide one with adequate vitamin D.</p>
<p>As a general guideline, we recommend the following doses of vitamin A from cod liver oil, along with a nutrient-dense diet that contains other vitamin A-rich foods:</p>
<p>    Children age 3 months to 12 years: A dose of cod liver oil that provides about 5000 IU vitamin A daily<br />
    Children over 12 years and adults: A maintenance dose of cod liver oil that provides about 10,000 IU vitamin A daily<br />
    Pregnant and nursing women: A dose of cod liver oil that provides about 20,000 IU vitamin A daily</p>
<p>Individuals under stress or wishing to use cod liver oil to treat a disease condition may take much larger doses, even up to 90,000 IU vitamin A per day, for a period of several weeks.</p>

			<p>a suggestion. chasing it with diet coke. i started that half way. It sped up the rate i drank it at by at least double. still very gross, but a LITTLE bit more palatable. </p>
<p>Try putting some diet coke or other soda in your mouth, drinking the drink, and then more diet coke.</p>

			<p>Tim&#8211;I&#8217;ve recently read your book and I love it as well as your blog.  That being said I wanted to share with you information on zith.  If and when a bacterial infection is present (which can occur as a secondary infection post cold or influenza due to opportunistic environment-i.e., viral invasion into host (you) results in inflammation of membranes in the sinuses for example, then the cilia which normally move &#8220;stuff&#8221; through your sinuses and nose get a build up of mucus and cannot perform their job, this results in normal bacteria present now swimming in mucous which creates the opportunistic environment for them to grow and overproduce in the trapped environment resulting in bacterial infection) then an antibiotic may help.  The Sanford Guide is a Bible of sorts for doctors who are treating sites as well as bacteria in different patient populations.  Recently (2008) The Sanford Guide recommends a dramatic change in protocol.  If you look at Community Aquired Pneumonia for instance you will see that it says if you are looking at a local resistance pattern for Strep Pneumo (the #1 causative pathogen for CAP as well as Acute Bacterial Sinusitis) is greater than or equal to 25% then you should abandon zith and use a resp FQ.  In the case of CAP any recent antibiotic activiity for any reason within 3-6 months, and or cormorbid conditions definately resp FQ.  The national avg of strep pneumo resistance is greater than 30%.  Locally in my area based on antibiograms of hospitals including outpatient isolates , zith is as high as 63% resistance with 38% intermediate resistance.  This information also can be found on the CDC website for tracking resistance patterns in the US.  Often patients are prescribed an antibiotic prior to bacterial infection based on sx. which are viral.  No bacterial infection is present (note greenish d/c is not always indicitive of bacterial infection nor is fever).  Doctors have been afraid from a business standpoint to tell a pt no, because they will just go elsewhere to get an rx.  Pt&#8217;s should be told that adjunctive therapy including netipot usage and pseudoephedrine (note that allegra d has psuedo in it but the allergy portion of it and other allergy meds can actually eventually thicken mucousa overtime which sets u up for chronic sinus infections due to opportunistic environment).  All that being said, zith isn&#8217;t the only anti-infective that is affected with resistance issues by being overprescribed.  The bug (strep pneumo) easily learned how zith worked (even zmax) because zith and zmax are bacteriostatic.  First, you must reach the mic necessary to kill the bug in the area of the body.  Zith enters the body and achieves mic initially, however it stays in the body for a long time and the mic of the drug drops continually.  Strep bug is not fully killed off (even zmax dose which can cause sever vomiting due to mega dose) and zith is in the body and the bug learns how to overcome it by a variety of methods and then you have a new resistant strain of zith.  Now here comes the second problem with this.  Not only will zith continue to decrease in susceptabilities due to it&#8217;s lingering in the body below effective mic, but taken again will be trying to kill a resistant strain.  The cycle continues.  Then when a patient takes another drug like trimeth sulfa, or penicillin, or augmentin etc&#8230; you have a bug resistant strep pneumo in pt population that now has learned how to overcome all of these drugs.  You end up with a patient population that not only has res to zith but now has a strain of strep pneumo known as multidrug resistant strep pneumo which is on average a 3rd of patient population and rapidly growing.  Thus the Sanford Guide says to pay attention to your local issues and instead of reserving certain classes like fq to use them up front in a suspected bacterial resp infection to rapidly kill the bug which resp fq like levofloxin are indicated for both strep pneumo and mdrsp.  To get the resistance undercontrol.  Certain fq are not good for resp, i.e., cipro due to it cannot get concentrations necessary at the site of infection, and avelox which can sit in gut long time and disrupt normal floral causing other issues trying to treat the first issue.  You have to a) stop using ai unecessarily b) use adjunctive therapy c) use an ai that is suited for your local resistance pattern, has least side effects, least propensity to cause collateral damage, and is cost effective (ie shorter duration of therapy so patients complete full course), and in the case of recurrent explore anatomical reasons/environmental reasons with a specialist.  </p>
<p>I was saddened to see your regimine listing zith because of the above information.  I&#8217;m sure in certain cases zith will work for a bacterial infection.  However, I think your popularity could fuel patients going into doctors offices demanding ai like zith and thus possibly fueling this problem.  Because, there are no new resp fq coming to market in the next 25 years it is important that we use antiinfectives that are only used as necessary and switch to more powerful antibiotics like levofloxin based on sanford guide recommendations to get things under control. We even have pockets of resistance in us that sanford would recommend hospitilzation for iv atibiotics-the last place you want to go if your sick because of infection control issues and cross infection issues many patients die vs outpatient, plus 10 grand to fix your illness isnot cost effective.  There are areas where this is applicable and it is rapidly growing!  If not and  you end up very sick (its the same pathogen strep pn that can also cause pneumonia not to mention that sinus infections can lead to brain abscess, etc&#8230;if not successfully treated) you could find yourself in a situation where there is no avail antibiotics for any of us that will work if we need them.  This is already happening at alarming rates because doctors are finding that there is mdrsp and it can&#8217;t be touched with trimeth/sulfa, pen, amox, rocephin, etc&#8230;  </p>
<p>The sanford guide not only states this but so does the American Academy of Otolarangology, IDSA/ITSA guidelines, etc&#8230;  Note: Your insurance company will probably not tell you this becuase they want you to use cheap generics to keep profit in their pocket.  Thanks.</p>

			<p>I modified a couple of the recipes for ease and convenience (what I had on the shelf already)  I found that our local mega-mart does not carry Kyolic (which is by far the best) I will be ordering the Reserve formula online which is high potency and without common allergens.  The Cardiovascular pictured is a good one if I need something urgently.  I&#8217;m taking C every hour as I had already heard this one from a prescription my mom had been given long ago.  </p>
<p>I prefer tasty foods and drinks, and have no oranges.  I wished I had some orange marmalade to add some ground ginger to, as that sounded yummy, but alas, no marmalade here.  </p>
<p>I brewed some herbal lemon tea and doubled up the strength by using two tea bags per 12oz cup.  I added ground ginger dierectly to the tea.  It requires regular mixing, and has a texture that I find acceptable as long as the ginger is very finely ground.  Hot gingered lemonade with honey (made with distilled water) is one of my all-time personal favorites.  I usually use about 1/4 teaspoon as a flavoring, using more for a more medicinal tea.  Although sugar depresses the immune system, I&#8217;m having to discontine honey at times due to it causing me to lose my voice in previous experiments, same with lemon, so I use them carefully.</p>
<p>Cinnamon tends to clump up and stick to the sides of the cup, so using about a tablespoon of cinnamon for about 6 cups of water, I brewed up some cinnamon tea by using my coffee maker and a coffee filter.  I then put two tea bags of chamomille tea in my cup of cinnamon tea to steep.  </p>
<p>Both of these are yummy to medicinal tasting depending on how strong you decide to make them.</p>

			<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>You should try Ban Lan Gan next time. It was used regularly in China during the SARS epidemic. They are available in water soluble sachets, and the taste is not too bad &#8211; like bland soup.</p>
<p>2 sachets day and night when symptoms appear normally works like a charm, followed by a good night&#8217;s rest under a lot of warm blankets, the whole &#8220;sweating it out&#8221; strategy.</p>

Loved all cold RENs. My question is&#8230; My colds often last ten days to two weeks; this common for and many people. Right now, my major cold symptoms have been over for a week, but continues to linger on in the form of clear mucus from nose &amp; throat and plugged ears. Going into my second week of these residual leftovers from my cold. Every few years this happens to me. </p>
<p>Will a ton garlic and vit C knock it out faster?</p>

			<p>I would normally take Reserve Kyolic (1800mg 3xdaily) to kill a bug.  I recently conducted an experiment with the generic garlic from the local megamart.  It was in a softgel form.  </p>
<p>I was also taking at least 4,000mg of vitamin C throughout the experiment.  Be sure to get buffered or ester-C when taking lots of Vitamin C to help your stomach handle it.</p>
<p>I started with taking 3000mg 3x daily of the softgels. The 3000mg dose did not knock out the bug, I increased the dose to 4000mg, but still had no relief.  I increased it again to 6000mg 3xdaily and still got no result.  I was sick for at least 2 months.  I then reverted back to my old standard, 1800mg of Kyolic, and the bug is finally gone.  Generic cheap stuff found at my local store just did not handle the problem, and if Vitamin C is expected to knock out a bug, it requires very high doses.</p>

			<p>Re: use of echinacea &#8211; it&#8217;s unfortunate your stomach&#8217;s response to this herb, Tim. A few things to know about &#8211; the type of echinacea used, i.e. echinacea purpurea is the one of choice, being at least twice as effective as the E. Angustifolia type (which latter seems more commonly used in US than in Europe).</p>
<p>With regards to efficacy, much of the promoted &#8216;research&#8217; may be a little suspect, the agendas of some researching agencies being a touch anti-competitive (with allopathic medicine, and particularly the pharmaceutical industries, if there&#8217;s no patent available, profit to be made, or consumer control available, they tend towards anti-herbal).</p>
<p>This leaves research from the herbal companies themselves, for which you can argue bias but, at least in the over-regulated EU, companies simply can&#8217;t get away with spurious claims (because of trading standard, consumer &amp; product legislation, &amp;c). In that light, research details can be had, re: efficacy, from the likes of A. Vogel (were Bioforce), a Swiss based company with outlets throughout Europe &#8211; within the nutriceutical industry their Echinacea tinctures are reckoned to be the most effective (although there&#8217;s a suspicion that their European, UK &amp; non-Swiss forms are not as strong as their non-EU-regulated Swiss ones). Vogel have noted that not only does the herb work to regulate the immune system (like a thermostat, works only when necessary, even if taken constantly), but also has a direct anti-infective action on pathogens.</p>
<p>Last note: Vogel do a kid&#8217;s Echinacea Complex, which combines Ech. with Plantago &#8211;  a herb used to keep the small tubes of kids clear of mucus. In our family we&#8217;ve given our 8 year old son this virtually from birth until recently &#8211; he&#8217;s managed to avoid all the clogging that colds &amp; mucus can have on the small tubes of children (known as &#8220;smit&#8221; in our part of the world), and I know of a good few parents who have used this with kids as a treatment of last resort (prior to surgical implants of grommits, that is) with excellent, and fairly fast results. Therefore, for your sinuses, Tim, the Plantago tincture on it&#8217;s own is worth considering.</p>
<p>PS. I don&#8217;t work for Vogel (although I&#8217;ve heard they&#8217;re a good company to work for re: fairtrade &amp; use of organic herbs). MK</p>

			<p>Hi, All!</p>
<p>A simple treatment that prevents not just colds but many other illnesses is colon hydrotherapy (not an enema, but a gentle flushing of the colon with pure water). It eliminates bacteria and toxins in the colon that may otherwise be absorbed and sent throughout the body.</p>
<p>I know what you may be thinking, but you cannot judge until you try it! It actually makes you feel great, as clean as you’ve never been!</p>
<p>XOXO</p>

			<p>Zicam is homeopathic &#8211; meaning there is no evidence for it working.  It is as good as taking sugar pills.  I thought you would investigate the scientific evidence behind any remedies you endorse rather than endorsing &#8220;snake oil&#8221;.  Spraying the gooey base of zicam up your nose may have some effect, but if it does, its the gooey base, not any proclaimed medicine.  Other than this, any benefit you or others feel is just placebo.</p>

			<p>Hi, we take &#8220;the bomb&#8221; whenever a cold hits. The bomb consists of : ginger, garlic, lemon juice and cayenne pepper. Because we are girls we add honey.

			<p>Great Chinese Remedy!<br />
As a practitioner of chinese medicine, I recommend something very similar to what your &#8220;moms&#8221; suggest.  They are right on!!<br />
Take a hot epsom salt bath, wrap up in blankets till you sweat a lot then drink some chinese herbal tea appropriate for the type of &#8220;cold&#8221; you have ( you can get this from your local acupuncturist).  I also add in extra vitamin c (via emergen-c), gargling with the every so disgusting goldenseal tincture for a sore throat if you have it (which works amazing for if the cold just won&#8217;t go away too), and sleep!<br />
Thanks for sharing!  Oh!  If you want to add in some green onion to your ginger and orange peel tea, it will help to release the cold as well:)<br />
Happy remedying!</p>

			<p>I had bad bronchitis and respiratory infections every winter for 10 years to the point where I needed inhalers.  Then I started drinking ginger tea two years ago (similar to described above).  I have only had one cold since and it was the first time that it resolved within a couple of days.<br />
I swear by ginger now and I even take ginger pills with me when I travel to make sure I get my quota and keep my immune system happy.  Drinking ginger tea (ginger boiled in water) is also recommended as part of an ayurvedic diet in India to take routinely, not just when you are sick.</p>

			<p>I brewed my own, which is really quite disgusting.  Kombucha tastes a bit like beer.  I hated that.  I used apple juice or ginger ale to cut the taste of it.  </p>
<p>I was taking it in hopes of obtaining some relief from Fibromyalgia.  I did not notice much difference while on it, so it was discontinued.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard stories of folks whose hair started to regain it&#8217;s youthful color while they were taking it.  </p>
<p>I might try one of the conventional brews rather than brewing my own if doing it again, but wow, you&#8217;ve just always got to filter that stuff!  It&#8217;s always growing, and my tummy can&#8217;t handle too much nastiness.  </p>
<p>The strong taste of ginger and orange is one thing, the texture of a fungus is a horse of a different color (reference from The Wizard of Oz).</p>

			<p>This is a very interesting post &#8212; although I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m coming to the party pretty late on this post.  </p>
<p>I do appreciate the fact that some of the folks here reference some of the Traditional Chinese Medicine from their own experience as either a practitioner or as a user of TCM.  It is interesting to point out, however, that in reality as someone mentioned &#8211; there are different TYPES of cold diagnoses in TCM &#8211; Heat invasion, Cold invasion &#8211; and sometimes both can occur.  Heat typically is observed as sore throat, scratchy eyes, thick mucous.  Cold invasion is typically body aches, thin mucous, possibly chills.  The treatments in TCM are different; in Western medicine they might tend to treat them the same way.  </p>
<p>Certainly, I respect the info in the post and will likely try that if I have the need.  I do wish that this country would open up a bit in terms of acceptance that there are other forms of treatment other than antibiotics or pharmaceuticals.  And I believe someone rightly mentioned that there really is no incentive in this country for the drug companies to do research on the age old &#8220;medicine&#8221; from China or elsewhere, because they can&#8217;t be patented and therefore there is no incentive.  Doesn&#8217;t mean that it is all bad, but it is unfortunate that we don&#8217;t offer on a wider scale more accepted opinions, experience and learning of things ancient cultures have approached for more than a few thousand years.  Not perfect, no doubt &#8211; but maybe there are some better things for our bodies than antibiotics for everything.  Thankfully, some excellent MD&#8217;s avoid the overuse of the antibiotics as well.  </p>
<p>An open mind is  a great thing!</p>

			<p>My all time favourite is the water+salt mix (one large cup water + 1 teaspoon of salt). As soon as I have symptoms I start taking small amounts of it through the nose several times a day. I use a pipette so that no water gets wasted and let the water flow down my throat. My ENT doctor told me to do this and I pray for her every time this mix saves me some headache :)</p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m too lazy to prepare other mixtures I simply drink herbal teas. Ginger tea with turmeric for viral infections, thyme tea (yuck) for a sore throat, and a mix of all when I&#8217;m not sure what it is going to be. </p>
<p>In case of heavy coughs there is this simple recipe that brings instant relief but also tastes yuck: 1 tablespoon vinegar, 2 tablespoons water, 1 teaspoon ginger, 1 teaspoon honey.</p>

			<p>I know this is a post about what to do when you have a cold, but I thought it would be valuable to post on here what I do to PREVENT ever getting sick in the first place!  I&#8217;ve been sick once in the last couple years, and that was food poisoning.  I&#8217;m not sure how long I&#8217;ve gone without being sick, but I really don&#8217;t remember the last time!</p>
<p>My prevention method is simple, and involves no drugs or medicine:<br />
1) First and foremost, get a decent amount of sleep for you.  Everyone is different, but for me I can usually get by with 6 hours for a few days, but then it catches up to me, and I try to get at least 8 to feel rested again.  If I ever feel that feeling as though I might be catching something, I immediately go to a minimum of 8 hours of sleep, but 10 is ideal until I feel better (usually a day or 2)</p>
<p>2) I take 4 vitamins/supplements per day:<br />
Green Tea &#8211; 1 capsule 250mg<br />
Vitamin D &#8211; 1 tablet 1000IU<br />
Magnesium &#8211; 1 tablet 250mg<br />
Krill Oil &#8211; 1 soft gel 300mg<br />
If I am feeling as though I might be coming down with something, I bump the Green Tea up to 2 per day, and add 1 or 2 capsules of Echinacea (along with more sleep as mentioned above).</p>
<p>3)Your beliefs about getting sick!  I&#8217;m sure there are people who think this step doesn&#8217;t matter, but I can tell you that I have no doubt in my mind that it was/is a huge step for me.  I started affirming to myself that I don&#8217;t get sick anymore until I actually believed that.  I now believe that my immune system can easily fight off anything before I am affected, and believe that I just don&#8217;t get sick anymore.  I know the mind is extremely powerful, and that we have yet to discover many things it can do.</p>
<p>This may seem too simple, but that is the whole point.  It&#8217;s simple and easy, and works, at least for me.  Some people on here might not believe that I haven&#8217;t gotten sick in 2 years+, and that&#8217;s ok.  All I can do is share my method, wish everyone the best, and leave the rest up to you.</p>
<p>Thanks and good health!</p>

			<p>Skip colds altogether. 1) drink this:Sage Tea &#8211; From The Breuss Cancer Cure. According to Rudolph Breuss, acclaimed author of The Breuss Cancer Cure; Sage tea is one of the most important of all beverages, for the maintenance of good health and vitality.</p>
<p>Boil one half liter of purified water, add 1 to 2 teaspoons of the sage herb (Salvia Officinalis) and let boil for exactly 3 minutes. Then add 1 teaspoon of St John’s Wort (Hypericum Perforatum) and 1 teaspoon of Peppermint Balm or Lemon Balm (Melissa Officinalis) and let everything steep for 10 minutes.<br />
This tea can be consumed 1 cup up to 3 times a day. It is also refreshing when chilled.<br />
I have also found old scars fading/disappearing  when I drink this daily for three weeks or more &#8211; and it taste fine.<br />
2) If you do get it. Don&#8217;t lay down for the germ! I tell the germ my immune system is going to kick the essence out of it and leave it weak and staggering &#8211; if it manages to escape.<br />
3) 3 cups of Epsom salt in a bath lasting 20 min or more is a homeopathic detoxifier. It also works great on any bruises, muscle soreness, body aches, hang-overs and boosting the immune system in general. It has been proven to pull toxins from the body and also increase the speed of healing bruises etc. I once saw a guys hand swollen 3x normal from an impact injury pour the salt into a disposable glove around his hand and 20min later the swelling was almost gone.</p>

			<p>One word to shorten colds:  Umcka.<br />
<a href="http://www.umcka.com/Clinical-Research/How-It-Works.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.umcka.com/Clinical-Research/How-It-Works.aspx</a></p>
<p>Adults with acute bronchial symptoms were able to return to work nearly two days earlier with EPs 7630.<br />
Matthys H, et al. Phytomedicine 10 (2003) Supp. IV, pp.7-17</p>
<p>If I take this the night I&#8217;m starting to feel under the weather, by the morning after, I swear I&#8217;m 50% better&#8230;which goes along with the above study.</p>
<p>Obviously, Vitamin D levels should be optimized beforehand, and then one could consider Stoss Therapy if they have the flu.</p>

			<p>Tim, </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what my good friend and personal mentor, World Leader in Health &#8211; Dr. Isaac Jones taught me be avoiding colds;</p>
<p>- Season food with tumeric generously<br />
- munching down on raw garlic daily<br />
- drinking green tea</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had good results within 1-2 days and now use it as a precautionary measure when I feel I have exposed to the likelihood of get a cold (e.g. length period out in the rain, feeling run down, little sleep or any combination of these factors)</p>
<p>Love to know your thoughts on this, perticularly around optimising this and your experience</p>
<p>Toodles -</p>
<p>Glenn</p>
