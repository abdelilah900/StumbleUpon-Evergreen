                    <b>June 28, 2012</b>  
                    <p>Moms have you ever thought about making your own baby food?  I know, too time consuming.  I need special equipment.  Let?s have a little baby food making info session today.  </p><p>First thing, commit time and effort.  It can become a chore if you don?t stay on top of it but as your child begins to eat chunkier textures then things begin to slow down.  </p><p>You will need to purchase a good food processor if you don?t have one already. You will also want to have several sturdy ice cube trays, preferably ones that have a cover.  You can use plastic wrap if not.  That?s really all it takes.  I found having small divided plastic plates that have lids a huge bonus.  </p><p>There are several great websites on the internet that will give you information you need in great detail.  So I won?t go into all of that.  I will say that as you prepare foods; make enough to freeze for later.  This is where the plates came in handy for me. I had twelve plates, three for each meal for four days.  Every fourth day I would take my frozen foods out and placed the amount of food in each plate corresponding with the meal the plate would be for.  Labeled the plates, placed them in the refrigerator.   This helped to have the convenience of prepared meals and helped me to see what I needed to cook in the next few day.</p><p>Remember, as you are cooking supper, put an extra pot on the stove and have the cooking part done.  A couple of things you can do if you want to give your child a few things but not go all out, mash ripe bananas or avocado, use canned pure pumpkin, and all natural jarred applesauce.</p>                                                                                {<em><a href="http://www.realmeals.tv/2012/06/baby-food/" title="Make Your Own Baby Food">More...</a></em>}

                    <b>April 11, 2012</b>  
                    <p>Food and recipe blogs seem to be all the rage these days, and new ones pop up on the internet all the time. Here are some pointers to starting your own food blog.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, remember that capturing clear, vivid pictures is always a good thing. One of the greatest parts of cookbooks are the photos, whether of the process or the final product. I wish most cookbooks included photos for every recipe. Make sure to take pictures of the whole process; especially techniques that might not be familiar to novice cooks, or things you think might need a visual aid. Always, always include a picture of the finished dish!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Make sure your recipe directions are clear and concise. Easy to follow, step by step instructions are always a plus. Laying out the instructions from start to finish works great, and then adding in any tips or hints, or even modifications at the end. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Another great tip is to catalog your recipes by category on your blog. This way they are easier for people to find, especially if you do all different types of recipes.  You should also leave comments open for your readers. Have them give feedback (even if it's not great!) on the recipes as they try them. Sometimes a reader might have a great suggestion for a substitution or modification for a dish, to make it diabetic friendly, or lower in fat, or for someone with a food allergy. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, remember why you started the blog in the first place, to share a love of cooking with others. While everyone may not love every recipe you post, it's sometimes the constructive criticism that can make you a better cook! Keep cooking, and keep posting those recipes!</p>                                                                                {<em><a href="http://www.realmeals.tv/2012/04/tips-starting-cooking-blog/" title="Tips for Starting a Cooking Blog">More...</a></em>}

                    <b>December 30, 2011</b>  
                    <p>Most kids will avoid vegetables like the plague, especially if they are used to living on sweets like cookies, candy, and cupcakes!  So how can you possibly get your child to consume enough vegetables to be healthy?  A well balanced diet isn’t impossible.  It just takes a little creativity on your part and maybe a little dose of sneakiness too.  The next time you are trying to convince Junior to eat his peas, try one of these tricks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Sneak in a Vegetable Puree</p>
<p>Do you remember feeding your kid all of the pureed vegetables during those months before he had teeth?  It’s time to pull out the baby food again.  Sneak in pureed vegetables into your regular recipes.  Add a small jar of squash, carrots, or even green beans into your spaghetti sauce and your kid will never know it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Sweeten it Up</p>
<p>If your child refuses to eat peas, try adding just a pinch of sugar to them.  This tiny bit of sweetness will make the peas a little more palatable while your kid is adjusting to the texture and natural taste of them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Grow It Yourself</p>
<p>Kids will be more likely to eat something that they had a hand in making.  Try growing your own vegetables in the summer!  It’s a great way to teach science and your child will be more likely to try new things if he has been eagerly waiting all summer for the vegetables to appear on the vine.  You can also let your kid help in the kitchen.  By helping with meal preparation, your child will be less likely to turn his nose up at the dinner on his plate.</p>                                                                                {<em><a href="http://www.realmeals.tv/2011/12/creative-ways-kids-eat-veggies/" title="Creative Ways to Get Your Kids to Eat Their Veggies">More...</a></em>}

                    <b>October 21, 2011</b>  
                    <p>Most people go to online <a href="http://www.ukfreebingosites.co.uk/">free bingo</a> websites because they love playing <a href="http://www.ukfreebingosites.co.uk/no-deposit-bingo/">no deposit bingo</a>. Don?t get me wrong; that?s why I go there too. However, I discovered that many of these online bingo websites are perfect for socializing. It can be somewhat difficult meeting people that have the same interests as me. Since I really love bingo, I?m often looking for people that I can chill with in the local bingo halls. However, I haven?t had much success finding people that enjoy bingo is much as I do. So, when I discovered online <a href="http://www.ukfreebingosites.co.uk/bingo-cams/">bingo cams</a> I was quite thrilled to find out that they have chat rooms and forums filled with people that love to play bingo just as much as I do.</p><p>It?s quite easy to begin socializing amongst the other <a href="http://www.ukfreebingosites.co.uk/xbingo/">x bingo</a> players. Most of the online bingo websites have fully developed forums and chat rooms that frequent users can join. All you need to do is to make up a username and password. Usernames should be well thought out as is the name that will be used for all your activities on the bingo website. Once you establish the username it?s pretty self-explanatory. I?ll tell you I have met so many wonderful people that enjoy bingo just as much as I do. These people are from all over the country, and in some ways I feel like I have made some virtual bingo friends.</p><p>One of the many reasons why I love playing online <a href="http://www.ukfreebingosites.co.uk/new-bingo-sites/">new bingo sites</a> is that it?s a resource for us serious bingo players. I love online bingo, but I still play locally as well. I have learned about so many new and exciting bingo opportunities from my virtual bingo friends. I recently found out that there was a bingo hall not too far from where I live, and one of the online players told me about a group that meets up to play bingo once a month about 20 miles from where I live. I would?ve never known about any of this had it not been for joining an online bingo website.</p><p>In many ways, these online bingo websites are a perfect way to socialize with people while playing the games you love. I have met so many wonderful people that give me such good advice about my gaming techniques and about how to find better paying jackpots. I would never have been able to find out this information on my own, so I?m very happy that I found out about online bingo websites. I?ve made a number of new virtual friends and am learning so much more about the game of bingo while having the opportunity to win substantial jackpots. This is why I love playing online bingo.</p>                                                                                {<em><a href="http://www.realmeals.tv/2011/10/kitchen-computer-time-social/" title="From the Kitchen to the Computer: Time to Get Social">More...</a></em>}

                    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">It used to be that humanity could be divided into neat groups. You were either a smoker, or you were a non-smoker. It is no longer possible to divide the world into two sections because electronic cigarettes have changed everything. Now some people are smokers, some non-smokers, others rely on e cigarettes 100% of the time, and still other bounce back and forth between traditional smoking and electronic cigs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">The main reason so many people have started using electronic cigs is because they are tired of going to places where they can&#8217;t use their cigarettes. Smoking is a way to deal with boredom, helps some people relax, and gives people something that they can do with their hands. Walking into a facility were you can&#8217;t smoke is a sure way to make sure that you start craving one. <a href="http://www.electroniccigarettesreviews.net/">E cigarettes</a> are one of the ways that you can enjoy a cig and not have to worry about getting slapped with a huge fine. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">After reading <a href="http://www.electroniccigarettesreviews.net/reviews/e-cigs">electric cigarette reviews</a>, I learned that electronic cigarettes have been designed in such a way that most of them feel just like real cigarettes. Some are even so authentic looking that it is almost impossible to distinguish them from real cigarettes. In addition to looking like the real deal, the vapor juice that e cigs use bears a remarkable resemblance to cigarettes smoke. Some people find that they get so hooked on the flavor of the vapor, that when they try to go back to their old brand of cigarettes, they find that they are actually repulsed by both the flavor and the way the smoke clings to their skin, hair, and clothing. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">The main reason that some people bounce between electronic cigs and their traditional cigs is because, while they like the convenience and other benefits of brands like the <a href="http://www.electroniccigarettesreviews.net/green-smoke-electronic-cigarettes-reviews">green smoke electronic cigarette</a> and <a href="http://www.electroniccigarettesreviews.net/safe-cig-e-cigarette-reviews">The Safe Cig</a>, they are having a difficult time finding the right combination of density, flavor, and throat hit. Until they find the perfect brand of e-cig, they are going to continue to bounce between authentic cigarettes and e-cigs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">The odds are pretty good that in the upcoming years, more smokers are going to make the leap to electronic cigarettes. While there are several compelling reasons for smokers to take the plunge, most of them will do so for economic reasons. The cost of a pack of cigarettes is already outrageously expensive and it is likely to keep climbing. Electronic cigarettes provide smokers with an opportunity to continue to enjoy nicotine, but at a fraction of the price.</span></p>                                                                                {<em><a href="http://www.realmeals.tv/2011/09/types-of-electronic-cigarette-users/" title="Types of Electronic Cigarette Users">More...</a></em>}

                    <b>July 25, 2011</b>  
                    It is an automatic assumption in most households a man is supposed to be the master of the grill, and Bobby Flay shows that he can make the grill do his bidding in amazing and delicious ways.  His shows on the Food Network include Bobby Flay's Barbecue Addiction, Food Network Star, Grill It, and Throwdown.  If you have a passion for things with a bit of Southwestern heat, then there is definitely a Bobby Flay recipe that has you covered.  Bobby Flay's flair for interesting takes on Spanish cuisine is a signature of his many restaurants located all over North America.  Last but not least, if the perfect steak is the holy grail of food in your opinion, Bobby Flay's signature grilling techniques are second to none.

Here are a few of the best grilling tips that Bobby offers to ensure that your summer grilling experience is a memorable one:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Stop moving the meat around every five seconds</strong> – It is important to actually give the food a chance to cook, so one minute after you put a steak on the grill you do not check to see if it is done on the bottom.  By giving the meat some time to sear on the bottom you ensure that it begins to naturally pull away from the grill grate and does not stick.</li>
	<li><strong>Do not cut or poke food on the grill to see if it is done</strong> – The main reason that you should not do this is that is does not really give an indication of whether something is done because you cannot see the inside.  By cutting or poking food on the grill, you also allow all the juices to escape, which in almost every case results in very dry meat.  A better way to test meat is to poke it with your finger; as meat cooks, it gets firmer and the firmness is a good indicator of when it is fully cooked.</li>
	<li><strong>Meat and poultry needs to rest s few minutes before serving</strong> – The simple reason for this is that the minutes when you allow the meat to cool allows the juices to seal inside the meat.  The meat also finishes cooking completely during the few minutes that you allow it to cool down before cutting and serving.  The best way to accomplish this is to remove the meat from the grill and then cover it in aluminum foil and allow it to stand for five minutes.</li>
</ul>
The grill is such a useful tool for cooking if it is used properly.  If you want to make sure that when you try one of the many Bobby Flay grilling recipes it turns out just as well as it does on Boy Meets Grill, then you need to make sure that you follow the grilling tips above.  The result will be moist, flavorful grilled meet that you can enjoy with your entire family this summer, which is just what Bobby Flay would want.                                                                                {<em><a href="http://www.realmeals.tv/2011/07/why-we-love-bobby-flay/" title="Why We Love Bobby Flay">More...</a></em>}

                    It is salad season again, and nothing tops a off a great salad better then a perfectly complementary dressing.  Homemade dressings are easy to make, and have a tendency to be healthier than store-bought dressings.  If you have a few simple ingredients in your kitchen you can utilize the following tips on the key elements in homemade salad dressings to make your own dressings to top your next summer salad.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Oil</strong> – Olive oil is the best kind of oil to use in homemade salad dressings.  Good quality olive oil does not have to be expensive, and if it is mixed in with a bit of sesame oil or nut oil, it creates a unique and distinctive flavor.</li>
	<li><strong>Acid</strong> – There are a few different options available to add acid to a salad dressing.  The usual addition is vinegar.  Vinegar comes in a wide variety of flavors including red wine, balsamic, white wine, apple cider, and sherry.  Another option instead of vinegar is freshly squeezed lemon juice.  If you are enjoying a salad that includes citrus fruit, a little bit of lime juice can be the perfect addition to the salad dressing.</li>
	<li><strong>Sweet </strong>– A bit of sugar is important to creating the right flavor with a homemade salad dressing. Again there are many different options to adding the element of sweetness.  Sugar, honey, apple juice, and maple syrup are just a few of the many options available to add a hint of sweetness to your salad dressing.</li>
	<li><strong>Salt </strong>– This part is meant quite literally.  A pinch or two of salt really helps to finish off a great homemade salad dressing.  If you are serving the salad dressing to others it may be best to only add a small amount of salt and allows individuals to add more to taste.</li>
	<li><strong>Aromatics</strong> – These are what add flavor and variety to your homemade dressing, and you have many different options to choose from.  Fresh herbs, garlic, and fresh black pepper are all excellent options.  If adding garlic directly, and it is too intense, the essence of the garlic can be added by crushing the clove to release the garlic juice then dropping the crushed clove into the oil that will be used for the dressing; remove the garlic clove before mixing the rest of the ingredients with the oil.  If you are unsure about which herbs work well in dressings, basil cilantro, mint, and parsley are all popular herbs to compliment homemade dressings.</li>
</ul>
It is a good idea to mix homemade salad dressings in a large glass flask.  Seeing all the colors in the salad dressing adds a certain something special to the meal.  It is important to shake any oil-based salad dressings well before serving.  Also be sure to sample the dressing on a piece of lettuce before serving it to guests.  In most cases, any unused dressing can be safely stored in the refrigerator.                                                                                {<em><a href="http://www.realmeals.tv/2011/07/making-homemade-salad-dressings/" title="Making Homemade Salad Dressings">More...</a></em>}

                    <b>June 24, 2011</b>  
                    Have you ever watched your favorite cooking show and wished that you could chop like that?  For most of us, when we try to chop like the professionals on our favorite cooking show, we either go agonizingly slow or run the serious risk of chopping one of our fingers off.  So what is the secret behind chopping like to professionals?  Practice is a big key, and the following tips can help you to hone your skills when chopping in the kitchen:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Understand the anatomy of the chef's knife</strong> – A quality chef's knife has a blade made out of high-carbon stainless steel.  Eight to twelve inches are the most common lengths for chef's knives.  There are several different styles of chef's knives including the German style, which features a curved head that is great for cutting with a rocking motion, the French style with a triangular head which is great for slicing, and the Japanese santoku style knife, which is designed with small bevels in the blade to reduce friction and minimize sticking.</li>
	<li><strong>Properly maintain knives</strong> – The blade of each knife needs to be sharpened with a whetstone. All knives need sharpening, even those that promise to “never need sharpening.”  Be sure to sharpen in the same direction every time to maintain the sharpness for as long as possible.  Knife blades also need to be honed.  This involves using a honing steel to smooth out the edge of the knife blade.</li>
	<li><strong>Learn how to hold the knife correctly</strong> – Chopping becomes much easier once you learn to hold the chef's knife correctly.  The thumb should grip the knife around the top of the blade, and the hand should be wrapped around the bolster of the knife.  The index finger and the thumb should be directly opposite each other on either side of the blade.  Gripping the knife this way provides much more control over the knife.</li>
	<li><strong>Learn the basic knife cuts</strong> – There is a difference between chopping something and mincing something, and the difference can make the meal.  By learning what the different basic knife cuts actually refer to, and properly making those cuts, you can ensure that that food cooks evenly and that the final presentation is impressive.  The basics include:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Chopping – cut into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter, and in the case of coarse chopping, slightly larger.</li>
	<li>Mincing – results in smaller pieces than chopping.  The knife is rotated around the cutting board in a rocking motion, back and forth across the ingredients.</li>
	<li>Slicing – thin, vertical cuts that result in strips that are about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
	<li>Dicing/Cubing – cut into uniform strips, and then cut into square pieces by cutting across the slices.</li>
	<li>Julienne – cut into thin pieces roughly the size of a matchstick.</li>
</ol>
Using your chef's knife properly and understanding how to chop up ingredients based on the specifications in the recipe can definitely help to improve the end results of your cooking.                                                                                {<em><a href="http://www.realmeals.tv/2011/06/how-to-use-a-knife-in-the-kitchen/" title="How To Use a Knife In The Kitchen">More...</a></em>}
