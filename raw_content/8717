Or, that your brain is the consistency of <a title="tofu" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu">tofu</a>? The following 50 ridiculous and weird (but true) facts about the human body can prove how little you might know about yourself (even if you are a <a title="surgical technician" href="http://onlinesurgicaltechniciancourses.com/surgical-technician-work-a-typical-day-in-the-career-of-a-surgical-technologist/">surgical technician</a>).<span id="more-254"></span></p>

<ol>
<li>The <a title="average adult brain" href="http://www.livescience.com/health/brain-facts-1op10-100417-1.html">average adult brain</a> weighs just under 3 pounds and is the consistency of tofu.</li>
<li>Although <a title="multitaskers" href="http://chronicle.com/article/Scholars-Turn-Their-Attention/63746/">multitaskers</a> are extremely confident in their abilities, evidence exists that shows those people are actually worse at multitasking than most people.</li>

<li>Overall, over time, <a title="human brains have shrunk." href="http://www.physorg.com/news187877156.html">human brains have shrunk.</a> But, brain size has nothing to do with intellect.</li>
<li>According to <a title="one calculation" href="http://education.jlab.org/qa/mathatom_03.html">one calculation</a>, the average human head contains 456 trillion trillion atoms.</li>
<li><a title="The brain" href="http://www.thethinkingbusiness.co.uk/brainfacts.htm">The brain</a> accounts for about 2 percent of body weight, but it uses about 20 percent of the oxygen in our blood and 25 percent of the glucose circulating in our bloodstream.</li>
<li>The old saw that we use just <a title="10 percent" href="http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/10percent.asp">10 percent</a> of our brainpower isn&#8217;t true. We use every part of our brain, even in daily functions.</li>
<li><a title="The brain" href="http://www.livescience.com/health/brain-fear-memories-100805.html">The brain</a> actually stores different parts of a memory in different locations.</li>
<li>It turns out that both true and false memories activate <a title="similar brain regions" href="http://www.livescience.com/health/top10_mysteriesofthemind-1.html">similar brain regions</a>.</li>

<li>A well-known <a title="side effect" href="http://www.livescience.com/health/botox-limits-emotions-100622.html">side effect</a> of Botox is the inability to fully express emotions. Now research reveals another side effect: the inability to fully feel emotions.</li>
<li><a title="People who are happy" href="http://www.livescience.com/health/061110_happy_healthy.html">People who are happy</a> are less likely to catch colds and report fewer symptoms of the illness when they are under the weather.</li>
<li><a title="According to one scientist" href="http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2008-05/future-human-evolution-immediate-emotion">According to one scientist</a>, a &#8220;very large part&#8221; of our brains is devoted to dealing with immediate threats, but a &#8220;very small part&#8221; is concerned about planning for the future.</li>
<li><a title="Shivers down the spine" href="http://www.livescience.com/health/mm_061120_music_chills.html">Shivers down the spine</a> even show up in brain scans, according to research at McGill University.</li>
<li>Contrary to popular notions about what is normal or healthy, new research has found that it is OK <a title="not to express" href="http://www.livescience.com/health/080603-bottle-emotions.html">not to express</a> one&#8217;s thoughts and feelings after experiencing a collective trauma, such as a school shooting or terrorist attack.</li>
<li><a title="Squinty eyes and a pinched nose" href="http://www.livescience.com/health/080615-facial-expressions.html">Squinty eyes and a pinched nose</a> are the facial signals for disgust, the opposite of flared nostrils and widened eyes that reveal fear.</li>

<li><a title="Beards grow faster" href="http://www.embarrassingproblems.com/problem/shaving-rash">Beards grow faster</a> in spring, possibly indicating a seasonal variation in androgen (male hormone) production.</li>
<li><a title="A recent study" href="http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/081111-hair-evolution.html">A recent study</a> suggests that hair keratins evolved first in our bird and reptile ancestors.
