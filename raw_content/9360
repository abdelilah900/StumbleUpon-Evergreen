	<p class="byline">Posted by <a href="http://mobile.seriouseats.com/user/profile/GoodEaterKenji">J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt</a>, March 21, 2011 at  6:00 PM</p>          
<p class="caption">[Photographs: J. Kenji Lopez-Alt]</p>

<p><strong>Ramen in the U.S. has come a long way. </strong>Once known only in its 10-for-a-dollar instant-lunch form&mdash;a staple of offices and dorm rooms all around the '80s and '90s&mdash;high-end <em>real</em> ramen shops are springing up left and right on both coasts and everywhere in between. As a half-Japanese kid in the '80s, I grew up eating instant ramen at least once a week, and it still holds a special place in my gut. The real stuff is great, but sometimes only the add-hot-water pack will do. </p>

<p>That said, my tastes have changed and expanded considerably over the years, and sometimes that little flavoring packet just isn't enough. As such, I've spent a lot of time devising ways to upgrade my ramen in cheap, easy ways. Ghetto gourmet, if you will.</p>

<p>As a card-carrying member of the Ramen Transmogrification Society of Greater New York,* it is my duty, my honor, and my privilege to share with you some of our methods and recipes.</p>
	
	<p>For full, step-by-step instructions on any of these dishes, please click through the <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html">slideshow above</a>.</p>

<h4>Simple Add-ins</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20110317-ramen-hacks-02.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="20110317-ramen-hacks-02.jpg"/></p>

<p class="caption">Mix-ins.</p>

<p>The easiest way to quickly upgrade a bowl of instant noodles is with ingredients that require no extra cooking. I'm talking simple <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147410">sauces and condiments</a> like:</p>

<ul><li>Miso paste</li>
<li>Chili bean sauce</li>
<li>Thai curry paste</li>
<li>Japanese curry powder</li>
<li>Fish sauce</li>
<li>Harrisa</li>
<li>Vinegar</li>
<li>Ponzu</li></ul>

<p>I'm a condiment hoarder (I've got a whole double-layered shelf of my fridge plus the entire door and a full pantry cabinet devoted to them), so this is a particularly easy thing for me to do. The key is not to go overboard with too many different competing flavors. I often make this mistake after long nights out, assuming that when it comes to hangover cures, more is better. Not the case. <strong>Keep it simple</strong>. Bear in mind that if you're using a salty condiment, you should omit some of the seasoning packet. You can also add:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Spices</strong> like white pepper, sichuan pepper, or chili flakes to the finished dish, or try adding a cinnamon stick, star anise, and coriander seeds to the simmering broth (remove 'em before serving!)</li>
<li><strong>Fats</strong> like toasted sesame oil, chili oil, or an animal fat (pork, chicken, or duck are all awesome)</li>
<li><strong>Citrus juices</strong>&mdash;a quick squeeze of lemon or lime right before serving can go a long way to brightening flavors.</li></ul>

<p>But imagine this scenario: you're in college, the power went out in your dorm room, and you obviously had no choice but to finish all the beer in the fridge rather than let it warm up. You're hungry, but you can't use the water kettle. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257/quotes">Keanu Reeves</a> pops up in your brain and asks: What do you do? <strong>What do you do?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147411">Here's the answer</a>: Just crunch up the noodles in the bag, tear off a corner, add the seasoning packet, hold the torn corner and shake it up, then consume. Lick your fingers clean after this one. It's like eating Cheetos, but with delicious "Oriental flavor" fingers instead of "orange cheeze."</p>

<h4>Vegetation</h4>

<p class="caption">Spinach.</p>

<p>Let's face it: Ramen ain't health food. But it's pretty simple to add a bit of roughage to your starch.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Quick cooking vegetables</strong> like <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147413">baby spinach</a>, romaine lettuce, bean sprouts, <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147415">thinly sliced cabbage</a>, watercress, and scallions (amongst others) can be stirred into the soup right before serving. They should wilt in a matter of seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Longer cooking vegetables</strong> like broccoli, cauliflower, snap peas, snow peas, shredded carrots, and whatever else your heart fancies can be added to the noodles as they're cooking. It may take a bit of finagling to get the timing just right, but I have faith in you, young grasshopper.</li>
<li><strong>Frozen vegetables</strong> can work great&mdash;corn and peas in particular fare well frozen (often being significantly better than their fresh counterparts!). I like to thaw them out by running them under hot water straight out of the tap for 30 seconds or so. They can then be drained and added directly to the hot soup just before serving.</li></ul>

<h4>Eggs</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20110317-ramen-hacks-06.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="20110317-ramen-hacks-06.jpg"/></p>

<p class="caption">Boiled eggs.</p>

<p>Ramen are pretty much all starch and fat (with most inexpensive ramen brands, the noodles are dehydrated by deep-frying them!). What about adding some extra protein? <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147414">Eggs</a> are cheap, delicious, and in most cases, can be cooked directly in the same pot with the noodles or the broth. Here are a few simple ways to do it. The World Society for Ramen Egg Cookery (an organization which I founded, chair, and am the sole member of) has divided ramen-eggs into 5 levels. It is unadvisable to attempt a higher level process until you've completed each of the levels preceding it.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Level 1: Hard boiled eggs</strong> are the easiest&mdash;just add the eggs to a pot of cold water, bring it to a boil, then drop in your noodles. The egg should be pretty perfectly hard boiled in just about the same time that it takes to cook the ramen through.</li>
<li><strong>Level 2: Soft boiled eggs</strong> are a tad trickier, because they involve a time. Drop them into the pot <em>after</em> it's come to a full boil, start a timer, and pull them out after 3 minutes for super-soft, or 5 for a fully-set white and semi-liquid yolk. I like to cut the eggs open and stir the yolk into the broth as I eat it.</li>
<li><strong>Level 3: The egg-drop method</strong> creates small curds of egg blossoms that float in the broth and coat your noodles. Lightly beat an egg in a small bowl. Once your noodles are cooked, swirl the noodles and hot broth gently around the pot. While the broth is moving, slowly drizzle in the beaten egg. It should set into fine ribbons.</li>
<li><strong>Level 4: Poached eggs</strong> will never come out perfectly shaped, but who really cares? Just cook the noodles until they've just started to separate from each other (about halfway through their total cooking time), pull the pot off the heat, break a raw egg into the center, place the lid on the pot, and let the whole thing sit for a couple minutes until both the noodles and eggs are cooked.</li>
<li><strong>Level 5: Fried Eggs</strong> require the use of an auxiliary pan and heat source. This is hyper-advanced stuff, and not to be trifled with until you've mastered all of the first-level egg techniques.*</li></ul>

<p><small>* Not really. It's still pretty darn easy.</small></p>

<h4>Simple Simmered Meat</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20110317-ramen-hacks-04.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="20110317-ramen-hacks-04.jpg"/></p>

<p class="caption">Flank steak with scallions.</p>

<p>Thinly sliced meats can be cooked in a matter of seconds directly in the pot. Chicken breast, pork tenderloin, or <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147412">flank steak</a> are all great candidates. I like to pick the pieces up one at a time and swish them back and forth in the hot broth until cooked while the noodles are simmering, then set the cooked meat aside and put it back on top right before serving. Cured meats like ham or bacon are great as well, as are cooked meats like leftover chicken or steak, or hot dogs. Want something really interesting? Add a bit of shredded up beef jerky as your noodles cook. It lends a nice smoky saltiness to the broth, and achieves a really delightful tender-chewy texture.</p>

<p><strong>And that's about it for the basics of ramen cookery.</strong> Once you've mastered all of the simple methods, upgrading your noodles is simply a matter of combining various techniques to achieve delicious end results. The most obvious ones are simplified, ramenified-versions of classic East Asian dishes. A dash of fish sauce and lime juice along with some beef and herbs quickly converts a bowl of noodles into a delicious <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147409">Faux Pho</a> (pictured up top). Add some shrimp and coconut milk, and you've got yourself a quickie-version of Thai style <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147418">Tom Kha Goong</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20110317-ramen-hacks-08.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="20110317-ramen-hacks-08.jpg"/></p>

<p class="caption">Stir-fried beef and snap peas.</p>

<p>With care, you can even make drier stir-fried or cold noodle dishes. The key here is to stop cooking the ramen just before it's completely done, then drain it. It'll continue to soften a bit from the residual heat, as well as cooking further when you stir-fry it or add a hot sauce. As with all stir-fries, the goal is to have your pan hot enough before adding ingredients that you get a nice quick sear before anything can overcook or turn to mush. When stir-frying ramen, I like to use part of the seasoning packet as a marinade for my meat. Cook the meat and vegetables in a hot skillet with oil before adding then noodles and whatever sauce you'd like (plain old oyster sauce with a touch of sesame oil is an easy crowd-pleaser). I like the simple combo of <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147416">flank steak with snap peas</a>.</p>

<p>Fake ramen-based <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147426">Pad Thai</a> also makes use of this technique, adding fish sauce, peanuts, vegetables, and a touch of lime and tamarind paste (if you've got it) for a quick, easy stir-fry that's actually better than most of the oversweetened, gloppy stuff you get from second-rate Thai restaurants. Do things right, and nobody will recognize your ramen when it's wearing its new Thai hat.</p>

<p class="caption">Ramincinnati chili.</p>

<p>Of course, there's no reason to stay in Asia here. Ramen takes well to Western flavors as well. How about some <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147419">cheesy chili ramen</a> or a <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147420">poutine-like dish</a> of toasted raw ramen with gravy and mozzarella? (Use real curd for authenticity's sake, or just go with the shredded stuff if you'd prefer.) Stir together cooked ramen with a simple gooey cheese sauce (see <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/09/cheese-sauce-for-cheese-fries-and-nachos.html">our recipe here</a>), or if you'd prefer, just a block of microwaved Velveeta thinned out with a bit of water, then pop the whole thing in the toaster oven for a <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147425">Ramac & Cheese</a> with a melty center and nice golden-brown crust.</p>

<p>Remember when <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/dining/06tacos.html">Spaghetti Tacos</a> were a thing? Well, here come <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147422">Ramen tacos</a> to take their place. Adding a pack of crunched up ramen noodles to the beef filling in a standard American taco kit add bulk, texture, and a whole boatload of fun! (and yes, that's fun! with an exclamation point!). Go Go Ramacos!</p>

<p>Canned soups can be bulked up nicely with instant ramen. Cream of mushroom, onion, whatever you'd like will work, but my favorite is to add a can of creamed corn, some sliced bacon, and perhaps a shot of heavy cream or milk to a pot of simmering ramen for an instant sweet and smoky <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147424">corn chowder</a>. A sprinkle of freshly sliced scallions completes this elegant soup, from a more civilized age. Wear a jacket, and don't let your tie dip into the bowl.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20110317-ramen-hacks-20.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="20110317-ramen-hacks-20.jpg"/></p>

<p class="caption">Ramepherd's pie.</p>

<p>But for the ultimate in fusion-comfort food, <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/03/ramen-hacks-30-easy-ways-to-upgrade-your-instant-noodles-japanese-what-to-do-with-ramen-slideshow.html#show-147427">Ramen-topped shepherd's or cottage pie</a> is the way to go. Mashed potatoes can be a pain in the butt to make for such a simple dish. Why not just boil some noodles, and use them as your pie crust instead? The top of the noodles dry out and become super-crisp under the broiler, while the noodles underneath remain tender. It's a uniquely delicious textural contrast, and one that I believe can help bring the world together.</p>

<p>Of course, we're barely scratching the surface here. Ramen may be one of the cheapest foods in the supermarket, but with imagination and a bit of cross-cultural, cross-class love, it can be one of the most versatile staples in your pantry.</p>

                    <div style="text-align:left;">Quickly upgrade the flavor of any bowl of ramen by stirring in miso paste, chili bean sauce, Thai curry paste, Japanese curry powder, fish sauce, or vinegar. If it's a salty condiment, omit about half of the seasoning packet. You can also add spices (white pepper, sichuan pepper, or chili flakes are great), oils (sesame oil, chili oil), or citrus (lemon or lime). Or, whatever you feel like, of course.</div>

                    <div style="text-align:left;">Eggs are one of the most versatile additions. The easiest thing to do is add the eggs to the cold water before you start cooking. Bring the water to a boil, let it boil for a minute or two, then add your noodles. If you timed everything right, the eggs will be hard (or soft) boiled just as the noodles finish cooking. You can also cook the noodles then stir in a beaten egg, or cook the noodles, pull them off heat, and drop an egg into the center. Cover the pot, and let the egg poach for 2 minutes before adding the seasoning and serving. Stir the semi-liquid yolk into the broth to enrich it.</div>

                    <div style="text-align:left;">For quick-cooking vegetables like baby spinach, sliced cabbage, or frozen peas, just add them after you pull the noodles off heat.

                    <div style="text-align:left;">Thinly sliced meats can be cooked in a matter of seconds directly in the pot. Chicken breast, pork tenderloin, or flank steak are all great candidates. I like to pick the pieces up one at a time and swish them back and forth in the hot broth until cooked while the noodles are simmering, then set the cooked meat aside and put it back on top right before serving. Cured meats like ham or bacon are great as well, as are cooked meats like leftover chicken or steak, or hot dogs.</div>

                    <div style="text-align:left;">A simple meat & veg combo. Add 2 slices of bacon cut into 2-inch strips and a couple ounces of sliced napa cabbage to the pot 2 minutes before the noodles finish cooking. The bacon will inevitably get picked out and devoured before anything else, but no worries&mdash;like the sweet purple milk left behind by the marshmallows in the Lucky Charms, the bacon leaves behind a lingering smoky richness that makes those last drops of broth the best part of the bowl.</div>

Drain the noodles and set them aside. In a large wok or skillet, heat a tablespoon of oil until smoking. Add the beef and cook without moving for about 1 minutes until well-browned. Toss the meat a few times. Add a quarter pound of snap peas and stir fry for about 1 minute. Add another tablespoon of oil, the noodles, the rest of the seasoning packet, a couple tablespoons of oyster sauce, and a bit of sugar. Toss until everything is well coated, then plate it up! Top with sliced scallions if your goal is to impress.</div>

                    <div style="text-align:left;">I don't know if anyone in Hawaii would go anywhere near this, but I think it's pretty awesome&mdash;super salty sliced of pan-fried spam, sweet pineapple chunks (you can use fresh or canned), a perfectly fried sunny-side up egg (fried in the same pan as the spam, of course), and a generous squirt of Japanese-style barbecue sauce. You can find this in most Asian grocers (look for the bottle with the bulldog on it), or you can make a quick version at home by mixing 2 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce, a tablespoon of soy sauce, and a half cup of ketchup together.

                    <div style="text-align:left;">Spicy, sweet and sour, coconut-scented tom kha goong is a snap when you start with instant noodles. After boiling and draining the noodles, just add half the seasoning pack to a couple cups of coconut milk along with fish sauce, sugar, and Thai curry paste to taste (wanna make it even easier? Just use regular old sriracha in place of the curry paste). Serve it with cilantro and limes for squeezing. A few strips of chicken or peeled shrimp added to the noodles a few minutes before they're done simmering makes for an instant upgrade.</div>

                    <div style="text-align:left;">Somewhere between a Thai-style peanut dipping sauce and a cold sesame noodle salad. You can barely recognize the low-brow roots of this classy rendition. Boil the noodles as directed, then drain them and add them back to a pot filled with cold water. Meanwhile, mix together a couple tablespoons of peanut butter (chunky!) and half of the seasoning packet along with 1 teaspoon of soy sauce, and a tablespoon or so of chili-garlic sauce (yes, sriracha works too), more or less to taste. Add just enough water to get it to a nice saucy consistency, then toss in the noodles along with some chopped cilantro, peanuts, and unsweetened coconut flakes. Coat thoroughly, serve immediately, and wait for the compliments to start rolling in.</div>

                    <div style="text-align:left;">It's tacky, it's bright red, it's made with ketchup, but it's <em>good</em>. Cook the ramen just until they break apart, then drain and set aside. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a wok or skillet and stir-fry some bell pepper along with a few chunks of spam until everything's nice and hot (or if you'd really like, some pork or chicken pieces). Add a small can of pineapple chunks along with their juice, a half cup of ketchup, and chili-garlic sauce to taste. Toss with the noodles, and serve with a side of irony.</div>

                    <div style="text-align:left;"><em>Real</em> pad thai is tough. The rice noodles go very quickly from undercooked to overcooked. With ramen-based pad thai, expectations go out the window, which makes it significantly easier to meet them. Cook your noodles just until they start to separate, adding a few peeled shrimp to the pot a couple minutes before they finish cooking. Pull the pot off the heat, then drizzle in a lightly beaten egg. Drain and transfer everything to a large bowl. Add half the seasoning packet, a few nice squirts of fish sauce, plenty of lime juice, crushed peanuts, scallions, bean sprouts, and if authenticity is your schtick, some tamarind paste (I just leave it out&mdash;the lime juice is plenty sour on its own). Nobody will recognize your ramen when it's wearing its new Thai hat.</div>

                    <div style="text-align:left;">Now we get into the realm of fusion ramen, and this is an obvious first step.

I've used goopy <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/09/cheese-sauce-for-cheese-fries-and-nachos.html">cheese sauce</a> here, but you can go the authentic route with shredded cheese if you'd prefer.

                    <div style="text-align:left;">Okay, before someone goes and calls the Mounties on me, yeah, I know <em>real</em> poutine is made with cheese curd, not shredded cheese like I've got here. But hey, this is a ramen hack, so deal with it. To get your ramen nice and crispy, just crunch them up in the bag, then empty it out into a skillet with a little oil. Toast over medium-high heat while tossing and stirring until everything is nice and golden brown. Top it all off with some gravy and cheese, and broil in the toaster oven until melty. Eat with a fork. And beer.</div>

                    <div style="text-align:left;">So <a href="http://spaghettitacos.com/">Spaghetti Tacos</a> may have finally died out, but the <em>ramen taco</em> trend is just in its infancy. Climb on board before this thing goes worldwide! It's easiest to start with a taco kit&mdash;the kind that comes with shells, taco sauce, and a seasoning pack. Cook up about half the amount of ground beef recommended on the box, then add a pack of raw crunched-up ramen noodles along with the water and seasoning packet to the skillet. Cook it down until the ramen is the desired texture (I like mine still a bit crispy), adding more water as necessary. Scoop it into taco shells, top as desired, and chow down.</div>

                    <div style="text-align:left;">An elegant soup, from a more civilized age. A balanced sweet, salty, smoky chowder with tender kernels of corn. To make it, start by crunching up the noodles in the bag, then transfer them to a saucepan along with a can of creamed corn and a few strips of bacon, sliced up. Fill the empty creamed corn can with water and add it to the pot. Add half the seasoning packet, then bring the whole thing to a simmer and cook until the noodles are nice and tender. The soup will thicken up into a thick chowder, which you can thin out as desired. Add a handful of thinly sliced scallions, and you're good to go. Want some extra decadence? Replace the water with milk (or cream!), and swirl in a bit of butter before you serve it. This is a dish best served with a tie on.</div>

                    <div style="text-align:left;">Sounds weird, tastes delicious. A traditional shepherd's (or cottage) pie filling gets topped with cooked ramen noodles then baked. The top of the noodles dry out and become super-crisp under the broiler, while the noodles underneath remain tender. It's a uniquely delicious textural contrast. See the next slide for the recipe.</div>

                    <div style="text-align:left;">Start by cooking a half pound of ground beef in a large skillet with a bit of oil. Add a half cup of choped onion along with half of the seasoning packet and a bit of water. Add some frozen peas, season to taste with salt and pepper, then transfer to a pie plate, a gratin dish, or a cast iron skillet. Top with cooked ramen noodles, then broil until brown and crispy on top.</div>
