							<div id="recipe-intro"><p>The big dilemma for those of us who like to cook but don't always have the time to do everything perfectly is whether to attempt to make our own pie crust or to buy a frozen store bought version.  Most frozen pie tins available in supermarkets across the country bake up into something that can taste pretty industrial.  Although both Trader Joe's and Whole Foods offer some pre-rolled frozen pie dough circles that will serve in a pinch.</p>

<p>If you do choose to make your own pie crust, there are a dozen methods out there for doing so.  Every cook and every cookbook seems to have their own favorite.  All butter, all shortening, vegetable oil, part butter/part shortening, lard; the list goes on.  </p>

<p>The following are instructions for making 1) a basic butter crust (pâte brisée) for sweet and savory pies and tarts, 2) a butter crust with ground almonds replacing some of the flour for added flavor for sweet pies such as apple pie, 3)  a pre-baked pie crust needed for dishes such as quiche, 4) a combination butter and shortening crust, and 5) an egg wash finish for the pie.</p>

<p>The instructions will yield enough dough for 1 10-inch pie with a crust top, or 2 10-inch topless pies or tarts.  If you are making a tart or just a pie bottom, cut all ingredients in half.</p></div>

									<p>One of the secrets to a flaky pie crust is to work with very cold butter. Cut the butter into cubes and freeze, at least 15 minutes, best over an hour or even overnight.  The minute I even think I might want to make a pie, the first thing I do is cut some butter into cubes and put it in the freezer.</p>

									<h3>Ingredients</h3>
									<h4>All Butter Crust for Sweet and Savory Pies (Pâte Brisée)</h4>

<ul>
<li class="ingredient">2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 cup (2 sticks or 8 ounces) unsalted butter, very-cold, cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li class="ingredient">1 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li class="ingredient">6 to 8 Tbsp ice water</li></ul>
								</div>
								





								
								<div id="recipe-method">
									<h3>Method</h3>
									<p><img alt="making-dough.jpg" src="http://www.elise.com/recipes/photos/making-dough.jpg" width="200" height="133" /><br />
<em>Dough is ready to shape.</em></p>

<p><b>1</b> Combine flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor; pulse to mix. Add butter and pulse 6 to 8 times, until mixture resembles coarse meal, with pea size pieces of butter. Add ice water 1 Tbsp at a time, pulsing until mixture just begins to clump together.  If you pinch some of the crumbly dough and it holds together, it's ready.   If the dough doesn't hold together,  add a little more water and pulse again.</p>

<p><img alt="pie-crust-crumbles.jpg" src="http://www.elise.com/recipes/photos/pie-crust-crumbles.jpg" width="200" height="133" /> <img alt="pie-crust-disc.jpg" src="http://www.elise.com/recipes/photos/pie-crust-disc.jpg" width="200" height="133" /></p>

<p><b>2</b> Remove dough from machine and place in a mound on a clean surface.  Gently shape into 2 discs.  Knead the dough just enough to form the discs, do not over-knead.  You should be able to see little bits of butter in the dough.  These small chunks of butter are what will allow the resulting crust to be flaky.  Sprinkle a little flour around the discs.  Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour, and up to 2 days.</p>

<p><b>3</b> Remove one crust disk from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes in order to soften just enough to make rolling out a bit easier. Roll out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch circle; about 1/8 of an inch thick.  As you roll out the dough, check if the dough is sticking to the surface below.  If necessary, add a few sprinkles of flour under the dough to keep the dough from sticking.  Carefully place onto a 9-inch pie plate. Gently press the pie dough down so that it lines the bottom and sides of the pie plate.  Use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough to within 1/2 inch of the edge of the pie dish.</p>

<p><b>4</b> Add filling to the pie.</p>

<p><b>5</b> Roll out second disk of dough, as before. Gently place onto the top of the filling in the pie. Pinch top and bottom of dough rounds firmly together. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang. Fold the edge of the top piece of dough over and under the edge of the bottom piece of dough, pressing together. Flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork. Score the top of the pie with four 2-inch long cuts, so that steam from the cooking pie can escape. </p>

<p><br />
<h4>All Butter Crust with Almonds</h4></p>

<p><em>Ingredients</em></p>

<ul>
<li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling</li>
<li>1/2 cup finely ground blanched almonds or almond flour </li>
<li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, very-cold, cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 heaping teaspoon brown sugar</li>
<li>6 to 8 Tbsp ice water, very cold</li></ul>

<p>Follow directions as for the All Butter Crust Pâte Brisée, but with the above ingredients.  Include the ground almonds in with the flour and the salt and sugar in step 2 above.</p>

<p><br />
<h4>To Pre-Bake a Pie Crust</h4></p>

<p>If your recipe calls for a <b>pre-baked</b> crust, as many custard pie recipes do, follow all the steps above until you get to the point where it says to put in the filling.  Note that you will need to make only a half recipe if you are only doing a bottom crust.  <b>Freeze the crust it for at least a half hour</b>, until chilled.  This is an important step in pre-baking.  Otherwise the crust will slip down the sides.</p>

<p><img alt="pie-weights.jpg" src="http://www.elise.com/recipes/photos/pie-weights.jpg" width="200" height="133" /></p>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F.  When the pie crust is sufficiently chilled, line the pie crust with parchment paper, wax paper, or aluminum foil.  Fill at least two-thirds full with pie weights - dry beans, rice, or stainless-steel pie weights.   Bake with weights for 20 minutes.  Remove from oven, cool a few minutes and carefully remove pie weights.  Poke small holes in the bottom of the pie crust with a fork and return to oven (without the weights) and cook for an additional 10 minutes, until the crust is golden.  Cool completely before filling.  You may need to tent the edges of the pie with aluminum foil when you bake your pie, to keep the edges from getting too dried out and burnt.</p>

<p><br />
<h4>Combination Butter and Shortening Crust</h4></p>

<p><em>Ingredients for one double-crust 9 inch or 10 inch pie:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>2 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 Tablespoons sugar</li>
<li>3/4 cup (a stick and a half) unsalted butter, chilled, cut into 1/4 inch cubes</li>
<li>1/2 cup of all-vegetable shortening (8 Tbsp)</li>
<li>6-8 Tablespoons ice water</li></ul>

<p><b>1</b> Combine flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor; pulse to mix.  Add the butter and pulse 4 times. Add shortening in tablespoon sized chunks, and pulse 4 more times. The mixture should resemble coarse cornmeal, with butter bits no bigger than peas.  Sprinkle 6 tablespoons of ice water over flour mixture. Pulse a couple times. If you pinch some of the crumbly dough and it holds together, it's ready. If the dough doesn't hold together, keep adding water, a tablespoon at a time, pulsing once after each addition, until the mixture just begins to clump together.</p>

<p><b>2</b>  Remove dough from machine and place in a mound on a clean surface. Divide the dough into 2 balls and flatten each into 4 inch wide disks.  Do not over-knead the dough!  Dust the disks lightly with flour, wrap each in plastic, and refrigerate for at least an hour, or up to 2 days before rolling out.</p>

<p><b>3</b> After the dough has chilled in the refrigerator for an hour, you can take it out to roll.  If it is too stiff, you may need to let it sit for 5-10 minutes at room temperature before rolling.  Sprinkle a little flour on a flat, clean work surface and on top of the disk of dough you intend to roll out.  (We use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dtupperware%2520pastry%2520sheet%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=elisecom&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Tupperware pastry sheet</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elisecom&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> that has the pie circles already marked.)  Using a rolling pin, apply light pressure while rolling outwards from the center of the dough. Every once in a while you may need to gently lift under the dough (a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dpastry%2520scraper%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=elisecom&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">pastry scraper</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elisecom&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> works great for this) to make sure it is not sticking.  You have a big enough piece of dough when you place the pie tin or pie dish upside down on the dough and the dough extends by at least 2 inches all around.</p>

<p><b>4</b>  When the dough has reached the right size, gently fold it in half.  Lift up the dough and place it so that the folded edge is along the center line of the pie dish.  Gently unfold.   Do not stretch the dough.</p>

<p><b>5a</b> If you are only making a single crust pie, use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough to within 1/2 inch of the lip of the dish.  Tuck the overhang underneath itself along the edge of the pie dish.  Use your fingers in a pinching motion, or the tines of a fork to crimple the edge of the pie crust.</p>

<p><b>5b</b> If you are making a double crust pie, roll out the second disk of dough.  Gently place onto the top of the filling in the pie.  Use a kitchen scissors to trim the overhang to an inch over. Fold the edge of the top piece of dough over and under the edge of the bottom piece of dough, pressing together. Finish the double crust by pressing against the edges of the pie with your finger tips or with a fork.</p>

<p><b>6</b> Use a sharp knife to cut vents into the top of the pie crust, so the steam has a place to escape while the pie is cooking.  <em>Optional</em> Before scoring, you may want to paint the top of your crust with an egg wash (this will make a nice finish).  </p>

<p><br />
<h4>Egg Wash</h4></p>

<p> A lovely coating for a pie can be achieved with a simple egg wash.</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Tbsp heavy cream, half and half, or milk</li>
<li>1 large egg yolk</li></ul>

<p>Beat egg yolk with cream and brush on the surface of the pie with a pastry brush.</p>

		<p>We recently moved to a property with about a dozen fruit trees and a berry briar. I have always been a pie baker and maker of a pretty flaky pie crust (although not always the prettiest ones.) But with all this fresh fruit at hand, I decided the time had come to expand my crust-making expertise.  </p>

<p>The best thing I've learned is this:  Pie and pastry crust freezes beautifully!!!! I have found a recipe that makes four single crusts at a time.         I wrap them individually and freeze them.  When you need one, just move it to the fridge a day  before you plan to use it.  I understand the dough will stay in the freezer for six months or more. Although, mine never lasts that long.</p>

<p>I've also learned scratch biscuits freeze beutifully as well (after baking). Just wrap them individually and put them in a freezer bag.  </p>

<p>With lots of company coming for the summer, I am making a freezer full of crusts and different doughs to be ready as the various ripen.</p>

		<p>Hi Susan,</p>

<p>The methods described here require a food processor.  You can make pie dough with a stand mixer or a pastry cutter, or even two knives, but I don't use those methods.  You might try doing a search on Google for pie dough mixer and see what turns up.</p>

<p>Another way to not have a soggy bottom crust:</p>

<p>Whip an egg white and brush the bottom crust with the egg white.  I am 75 years young and have made different pies for 55 years and have found this tip, I found long ago, to be "fantastic".  It works.</p>

		<p>Personally, I believe you don't need any kind of mixer at all!  Just use a bowl, fork and rolling pin... it's not hard and doesn't take long.  You need to get flour on your hands -- otherwise why don't you just buy the dough at the grocery?  </p>

		<p>This is a great recipe! Being a celiac(intolerant to gluten) I can't buy frozen pie crusts. I make everything from scratch so I know exactly what I am eating. I just used arrowroot flour instead. I found mixing with a dough hook in a KitchenAid stand mixer best but hand kneading works well also.</p>

		<p>I have a kitchen Aide Mixer and love it, however, I can tell you from years of experience a plain old Pastry Blender (an old tool still available today) has a handle and a 1/2 dozen little long blades, is the best and quickest way to make pie dough. Just chop it around in your flour with the butter, lard, shortening and in a minute or less you have the nice crumbs you are looking for. </p>

<p>Also we always add 1 to 2 tsp of cider vinegar to all of our pie doughs, it makes a really nice flakey crust. </p>

		<p>Elise,<br />
I love all the pie crust recipes, and I just put a pie in the oven that used your Strawberry Rhubarb recipe. One question: have you tried using the no trans fat crisco? I've tried it twice for pie crusts, and both times the dough ended up too soft and malleable, even after refrigerating it overnight. The most disappointing part was when the top crust sort of collapsed in on the pie. Thankfully, it didn't affect the flavor at all. I'm wondering if I need to reduce the amount of shortening, but I'm afraid that will make it dry, and changing the butter/shortening ratio would lose the benefits of less saturated fat. When I was a kid I made great all-crisco pie crusts, but now I'm not having any luck. I'd love to hear your thoughts. </p>

		<p>Megan,</p>

<p>After many years of successful pie crusts, I too am now having problems due to the new shortening formula.  I ended up calling the shortening company, using the phone number on the can, and they said they have had many customers express concerns.  She even said in their own test kitchens they have noticed the difference in the performance of the shortening.  She said their bakers tried adding additional water to the recipe, though I attempted this and did not have much luck.  </p>

<p>If you discover any solutions, please let us know - Thanksgiving is right around the corner!</p>

		<p>This page has been so helpful.  I used to make pie crusts frequently when I was a kid for my mom.  I must say, I did a fine job.  However, I moved away about 8 years ago, and probably haven't made a crust in about 10 years.  I'm having Thanksgiving at my home this year for a total of 18 close relatives (first time roasting a turkey - should be interesting).  I'm making three homemade pies, crust and all (even fresh pumpkin from a friend), and was a bit worried about my crust making skills.  Thanks so much for the refresher course!</p>

		<p>I am trying to plan ahead for Thanksgiving and I am wondering if the all-butter crust can be frozen? I've never done that before...how would I go about it?</p>

<p><em>Note from Elise:  Just roll out the pie dough and form the crust in the pie pan, then put it in the freezer.  If you are freezing for more than a day or so, wrap it in plastic wrap and then aluminum foil first.  You can also put the dough in the freezer before you roll it out, but then you will have to defrost it before using.  A frozen pie crust you should use as is, without defrosting.</em></p>

		<p>I'm a late-comer to this party, but I wanted to mention that those of us without electric mixers should not despair. I followed the all-butter recipe up top there in conjunction with Teresa Nielsen Hayden's "Savory Pie For The First Day of Winter" (http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/009676.html). Mixing the butter in with my hands, and then mixing the water in with my hands, worked perfectly well. I may have used more water than the recipe calls for (6 tbsp? Really?) but the crust was flaky and light and perfect all the same.</p>

<p>I want to call attention to two tips I picked up from the aforementioned Making Light blog thread:</p>

<p>* Freeze the butter and then grate them on a cheese grater (being careful not to smoosh the results together as you continue grating; I grated them right onto the flour and periodically mixed them in as I went)</p>

<p>* Place your water in the freezer until it develops a thin skin of ice on top</p>

<p>These worked really well for me. I'm doing it again tonight, the so-called "first day of winter" (winter solstice) to make those savory pies.</p>

<p>Thank you for a really useful article!</p>

		<p>I'm new to the whole baking thing. Before I moved out of my parents house in Seattle, I thought that pie crust always came from Mom or the grocery store... but after a year here in Madison Wisconsin I realized all great bakers have to start somewhere. Luckily I found this website and have been baking pies every week! I guess it can be a little intimidating, but I have been working hard on this whole "do it yourself from scratch" thing... I couldn't have done it without the helpful suggestions of so many WISE WISE WISE individuals. Thanks to you guys I have perfected a delicious double decker cherry-peach pie!</p>

		<p>I used to make a pie crust with my mom which consisted of mixing unmeasured amounts of tenderflake lard and all purpose flour until well blended. Lastly adding milk to make a very, flakey, tender crust for either sweet or savoury pies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't seem to be able to get the consistency right anymore and with mom gone these last 17 years I was hoping someone might have a similar measured recipe.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.</p>

		<p>Instead of a food processor or even a manual pastry blender, you can use two table knives to quickly cut the butter into the flour mixture.  Hold one knife in each hand, cross them like an X with one tip at each side of the bowl, then draw the blades towards each other rapidly and across to the other side of the bowl.  By doing this repeatedly while occasionally turning the bowl and mixing in the flour by stirring with the knife blades, you will generate the desired pea-sized bits of butter that will lead to a flaky pie crust.</p>

		<p>I am absolutely new to pie making. My pie crust was simply too brittle. I could roll it but then it woudn't stay together when I lift it up. Can you tell me why this is happening? Is it because my butter has melted too much?<br />
I want to bake it in a microwave. Do you have a recipe for the same?</p>

<p><em>Your butter should not have melted at all. Softened a little, yes.  Melted no. If the crust isn't holding together, it sounds like you need a little more ice water added to it. Regarding the microwave, you can't brown food in a microwave.  Microwave ovens cook by heating up the water molecules in food, so the effect you get is similar to poaching, or boiling.  Browning requires higher heat and a dry roasting oven.  So, no, as far as I know you cannot bake it in a microwave.  You can defrost a frozen crust in a microwave and then bake it in a toaster oven.  But baking requires the dry heat of a roasting oven or toaster oven. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>I found that a potato masher does just as well or better than a pastry blender. I was going to purchase a pastry blender at Wal-Mart but it looked so flimsy I knew it wouldn't do the job and was $3.00+. Nearby was a $1.50 potato masher so I brought it home and tried it. Its the kind with the zig zag bottom, not meshed like some. It works wonderfully !</p>

		<p>I made the above recipe for pie crust but I made a few changes and it came out perfect.  This is my first time on this site and love it already, the idea of putting the butter in the freezer I had never heard of before and I made a perfect crust using this idea. I cut portions because I only needed a single crust. 1 1/4 cup of flr.-1 stick of (Smart Balance 50/50 Butter Blend--purple box---I made a healthy version crust and it was perfect in texture and taste-it has omega 3 and no transfats.)salt was already in the Smart Balance, kept the full 1 tsp sugar-needed 3 tbs of water and 1 apple cider vinegar for flaky crust (the amount of liquid used is the tricky part). That is why you have to test the dough before adding too much liquid. Made a fresh peach pie, peaches were so sweet didn't need sugar, I made a crumb topping instead of crust, added oats for taste and crispiness. I usually make a good pie crust using my food processor to make the dough, but my crust sometimes is hit or miss in texture, the frozen butter and the pictures helped me make it perfectly...Also, a hint from me if you are making a very juicy pie, crush some saltines,  non salted and put on the bottom of the crust before adding fruit, that will absorb some of the juice to help keep the bottom crust from getting mushy or crushed vanilla wafers or ginger snaps depending on flavor of your pie. You can make a pie healthy, now my hubby can and will eat the crust. He loved it.....Thank you for your suggestions, I hope mine helped someone.</p>

		<p>Elise, I found that if you prepare your apples as directed with the sugar, cinnamon etc.. and then cook them for about 10 minutes in a deep fry pan, let them cool for about 25 minutes and then add them to your pie crust and bake, the top of your crust will stay nice and high and there will be no space between the apples and the top crust.  </p>

		<p>Elise! Thank you SO much for posting this! This came out absolutely amazing! I made it for my Mom-in-law's pumpkin pie recipe and it came out just absolutely spectacular. I ended up taking the second half of the dough and kneading it some more and making it into cinnamon shortbread pinwheels. They are my new favorite cookie. They came out absolutely amazing. They were actually intended to be cinnamon rolls, but I cut them a bit short/small and so they ended up cookies.. but they are amazing anyway!

		<p>As an Australian, we don't use 'sticks' of butter: I have been to the US many times before and never thought to check out how many ounces/grams a stick is.I am familiar with all-purpose flour and most other US ingredients.<br />

		<p>Regarding non-trans fat shortening, I have been substituting organic extra virgin coconut oil (slightly chilled), which works perfectly. If you try this,be sure to use unrefined coconut oil which is very healthy, as opposed to the refined (hydrogenated) oil which is full of trans fats. You will not get the coconut flavor once the pie is cooked. I use Nutiva brand which is pricey but absolutely amazing.</p>

		<p>I have perfected my pumpkin pie and want to work on making a much tastier crust. So, I want to try to make it myself. I am allergic to butter, and worry about 'crisco' (shortening) being so unhealthy. Are there alternative crusts? Such as, made with margrin? or other substitute?<br />
Thanks,<br />
Audrey</p>

<p><em>The problem with shortening was the transfats, which they have now pretty much removed.  Look for a version of Criso that says Zero Transfats on the label.  Lard is also an option, though unless you render it yourself, it is often packed with preservatives, which you don't want. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>I've always used shortening for pie crusts with no problem. It's key to keep your Ingredients as cold as possible until it's time to bake. A pyrex pie plate is also key for even temp. plus you can see how your crust is doing on the bottom. I use 2 1/4 C flour, 3/4 teasp salt, 3/4 C shortening and about 5 Tbsp ice water for the crust. Cut the shortening in before adding the water, and then mix in 1 Tbsp at a time of water mixing it in with a fork. I sometimes use a couple of Tbsp of lemon juice in place of some of the water. This last time I used all orange blossom water and lemon juice,(nice and cold) and it came out great. I'm not exactly sure who it was but a master pastry chef (centuries ago) use to do his work in a ice house type atmosphere to assure the flakiest pastry. So! stay cool! and don't overwork it. Good luck! Oh! I always use a hand pastry cutter. And when making a two crust pie I wrap one crust and fridge it while making the next, and then roll the cold one while the other chills. Remember keep things cold.</p>

		<p>I made this pie crust on Sunday...my first time ever baking a pie.  I've watched my Grandma make thousands of pies, using oil, but I wanted a more flaky, less dense crust.  It turned out beautifully!  I do not have a food processor, so I froze the whole stick of butter and grated it.  I then mixed it into my flour mixture, which I had in a large porcelain bowl on chill in the freezer.  I used 9 tbsp. of ice water...although it wasn't really forming into a ball.  I put it all into a freezer bag, pushed the air out and pushed the mixture together with the heel of my hand.  I let it sit overnight and rolled it out between two pieces of parchment paper.  There wasn't a crumb left!  I made another one on Monday!  Thanks for the recipe!  Now if I only had a food processor!</p>

		<p>Ok, I just made two batches of the all-butter dough recipe in my food processor.  I had to use 9 Tbsp of water in both batches.<br />
When I poured the dough out to form the discs, the dough would barely stay together, dry clumps would fall off.  Should I have used more water, or is that what I should have expected?<br />
Thanks!</p>

<p><em>Hi Lyndsey, this is a great question, and one that hard to answer, not being there.  I've made so many pie crusts and each time the trickiest thing is the amount of water.  You want just enough so that it will hold together, but not so much that it is dough-y.  Sometimes just wetting your hands when you form the dough will be enough to do the trick if the dough is still a little too dry to hold together.  All I can say is practice, and find a balance that works for you. I think I err on the more water side, but every pastry chef I consult says use the smallest amount of water possible. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>Hey, everyone who thinks they can never make homemade pie crusts because they're missing some kitchen utensils: don't despair! I'm a college student living in a tiny apartment and my mom would kill me if I ever bought a food processor, much less a rolling pin! If you don't have a food processor, roll up your sleeves and get down and dirty. Pinch the butter with your fingers and until the flour/butter mix is crumbly. Instead of balls of butter you'll have "shavings" and small clumps of it, but the end result still looks like Elise's picture above. After adding the right amount of ice water, you'll want to refrigerate the dough for a half hour (because your hands are warm; give the butter some time to solidify again before flattening it).  When you take it out of the fridge, let it sit for 2-3 minutes so it's easier to roll.</p>

<p>As for a rolling pin... well, anything cylindrical works.  I floured my cutting board (there are no counters in my apartment) and put a piece of plastic wrap on top of the dough then used a jar as my rolling pin.  It did the trick! Pie is in the oven and I baked a piece of scrap dough to taste it--flaky and scrumptious. Thanks, Elise, for sharing this delicious recipe!</p>

		<p>I found an ingredient for pie dough in my Cook's Illustrated magazine.  The ingredient is vodka!  You replace 1/2 of the chillled water used in a standard pie crust with chilled vodka. You can actually use more water and vodka then you would traditionally because vodka is only 60% water.  It makes working the crust as easy as working with playdough, and yet the vodka cooks off during baking, leaving an extremely flaky, tender crust.  I don't know how come more pie makers don't know this one.</p>

		<p>Hi Elise! I made your combination shortening + butter crust and it was absolutely perfect! It worked amazingly for the sweet potato pie I made and everyone just went nuts! Even my grandmother who once was an amazing baker! </p>

<p>I have a question though. My grandmother has been sick with cancer for a while and I am wondering if you have any ideas about a crust and filling for a pie that uses stevia - no sugar. Sugar actually feeds her cancer so she cannot have it ... in the case of my pie ... she took a little bite. </p>

<p>I'd like to make her a pie she can devour. =) Thank you.</p>

<p><em>Hmm, good question. I suspect that she probably should be staying away from pastries, altogether.  You can leave the sugar out of the crust, but as for the filling? You might want to do a simple apple pie, but sweetened with stevia instead.  I don't know anything about baking with stevia, but there are cookbooks available online if you look. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>I just made the butter shortening combination crust (my first time making my own crust).  It turned out wonderful!  The only problem is that it is so good that I am eating more of the pie just for the crust.  I do not own a mixer or a pastery cutter so I used my hands.  It worked out perfect.  The pie sat for a day before we could finally eat it (made for a family get together) and the crust was perfect.  I was very pleased to find out that the bottom was not soggy at all (Sour Apple Tart Cherry Pie).  Everytime I bought a role of pie dough for an apple pie the bottom came out soggy. I will never buy pie dough ever again!  This is what I will use from now on!</p>

		<p>I have tried & failed so many times to make delicate, flaky pie crust like my mother's using her recipe & instructions & techniques. She used a bowl & pastry cutter & her hands.  So I've decided to go ahead & get a food processor and try it this way (no doubt will use the food processor for many other things as well).  My question is, what size should I get?  I can't afford an expensive one, and have looked at a 4C Cuisinart & a 10C Hamilton Beach, both of which have good reviews.</p>

		<p>What a great site..</p>

<p>Question on blind baking for you. I am trying to perfect a blueberry pie recipe and I can't seem to find a way to keep the bottom crust from basically melting during baking. </p>

<p>I'm using what I hope is a reasonably standard crust recipe of 2.5 cups flour, 2 sticks of butter, a bit of salt and sugar. I am pre-baking the bottom crust for 20 minutes in my oven at 350 until it is golden brown. using rice and foil for weighting and letting cool for 30 minutes. The bottom crust is about the same thickness as the top crust.  From here, a blueberry reduction with 2 cups blueberries, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water, dash of cinnamon and nutmeg is added along with the top crust. I baked at 350 for one hour...</p>

<p>I had the same trouble with a savory lamb pie I tried with no blind baking - the darn bottom crust just disintegrated. Any thoughts would be much appreciated. I'm soooo close on this..!</p>

<p>Chris</p>

<p><em>I think your problem with the blueberry pie is that cup of water.  If you check our <a href="http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/blueberry_pie/" rel="nofollow">blueberry pie recipe</a> you'll see it calls for 6 cups of blueberries and only 1 Tbsp of liquid (lemon juice). No added water.  It also includes 1/4 cup of flour as a thickener.  ~Elise</em></p>

<p>*1/2 butter 1/2 shortening for good butter flavor & an extra flaky crust.</p>

<p>*Incorporate cake or pastry flour into the AP - a 1to1 or 1to2 ratio for an extra tender crust. </p>

		<p>When my pie is done, there is a couple of inches between the top crust and the pie filling.  What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p><em>Some pie fillings cook down a lot, apple pie for instance.  What you can do with apple pie is pre-cook the apple slices a bit first, so they release some of their moisture and shrink a bit.  You can also make a <a href="http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_a_lattice_top_for_a_pie_crust/" rel="nofollow">lattice pie crust</a> for the top crust, which will sink on the filling as the filling shrinks as it cooks. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>The frozen butter and ice water aspect are essential for a great crust, don't disregard this. Two new tips for everyone.  I use a spray bottle with ice water when adding to the dough.  The spray allows better distribution of the water and helps avoid over-kneading.  Also, take bags of frozen veggies, potatoes, or anything you have frozen in a bag (ice) and lay that on the counter surface for a few minutes before you roll your dough.  This will help keep the dough ice cold as you roll.</p>

		<p>The only way to fix the soggy-bottomed crust problem is to cook your pie for the first 15 minutes at an additional 50 degrees F of heat (this rule is for custard pies). As this recipe calls for 375, you cook it at 425 for the first 15 mins, then turn it down. For fruit pies, use an additional 100 degrees of heat for that 15 mins.<br />
I actually halve this recipe and roll the crusts out thinly. It's perfect.</p>

		<p>My daughter and I made 24 pie crusts in three hours. My recipe is similar to all of the above. One also mentioned rolling a single pie crust dough in a plastic bag. I came across this idea last year and it should win a Noble Peace Prize in the Humanities category. There is no worse frustration for superwoman of today, than reworking piecrust dough that rips,tears, mishapened and time consuming. Few additional advice,  the addition of a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice to a cup of water with crushed iced can be used sparingly to the point that if the dough holds together when you pinch it that is enough . No need to form ball. Put mixture in a gallon size freezer bag,flatten out dough with hand at the same time removing any air. With rolling pin, spread to all the four edges until dough thickness is even. The bag helps contain the mixture and the dough easily holds together. There is where the key to tender and flaky lies. No reworking the dough. No additional flour used to roll out dough! You still will see your butter. Zip up the closure, and place in refrigerator or freezer until you use it. If frozen, thaw just until maleable. If the dough cracked with handling when frozen, just press edges together. The best is that no mess!<br />
Open the zipper and cut the sides and bottom of the plastic bag. Remove the top plastic layer. Place your pie pan over the square of dough, and you will notice it is just about the same diameter, but you have the extra four corners. Invert the pan along with the plastic side to support the dough. Remove the plastic and now your dough is in your pan. Shape into mold of pan, using the corner dough to work along the top edge for your flute or sparse areas. Refrigerate prepared pie dough pan for ten minutes, then proceed. This dough when baked is so flaky it results in a crust twice the thickness you rolled it out as! If you need a different shape, just roll several squares to desired dimensions between two lightly floured pieces of parchment paper. My only concern is to figure out how to actually make and bake 24 pies by Thanksgiving. Twelve pumpkin and twelve pecan. The cost of ingredients alone was $150.00. I think I will have to premake and bake the pumpkin pies. I have double ovens. Has any have any experience with making both type of pies ahead of time, thus having to freeze them so they won't spoil? Please share your ideas! For example, can you make the pecan and pumpkin filling and refrigerate. Then put together and place the pecans and bake,etc. Or does freezing effect the taste? Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

		<p>I have tried with many, many different pie crust recipes.  No matter what I do....my bottom crust always seems to be soggy.  I have made pumpkin pie....and maybe 1 or 2 other types...but most frequently made pie is cherry....with lattice top crust.  Top crust is fine....shrinking crust, minimal...bottom soggy crust...not wet....but definitely NOT flaky at all.  Any suggestions??<br />
TIA....</p>

<p><em>Hello Brenda, one suggestion I've received for soggy crusts is to preheat a baking sheet in the oven and then place the pie pan on the baking sheet once the oven is hot. ~Elise</em><br />

		<p>Wonderful and easy! The all~butter crust is semi~flaky. After pulsing in the water and checking for cohesion, I dumped it into a gallon freezer bag and press / kneed it to hold together. Then, cut in half and plastic wrap half of it,leaving the other half in the bag. Thank you for this easy and semi;) healthier crust version.</p>

		<p>Megan and Leslie,</p>

<p>I was so glad to come across your comments- I used to make a lot of pie. Traditionally, I used a mix of crisco and butter or just crisco. I haven't been baking much lately, but set out to make a pie last night, with crisco for my husband who is lactose intolerant. The first batch of crust (using butter flavored crisco) was a disaster. The second (using regular crisco) was a little better. I managed to get it into the pan by pressing, but it just crumbles apart. <br />
The crisco had been in the freezer, all the ingredients and the bowl were chilled- and still no luck. With Thanksgiving approaching, I was starting to have pie crust panic, until I came across your posts.<br />
Does anyone know if the problem is ok if you use a mix of butter and crisco? Or am I stuck with butter only crusts? (In the past, I found that the combination worked better than pure butter.)<br />
Thanks!</p>

		<p>What do you think about infusing espresso into the pie crust? I would replace the water with it. I'm thinking so long as it is still ice cold, it shouldn't make a difference? </p>

<p>Do you think it would taste bad, I really can't decide. The recipe I use it actually my mother's... It's a lard, water, salt, an egg, flour, and vinegar; very delicious but I think the vinegar and espresso would clash. What do you think?</p>

<p><em>Espresso is bitter.  I'm guessing it wouldn't work so well added to the dough, but who knows? If you try it, please let us know how it works out for you. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>I used this recipe to make my first pie crust! I made an apple crumb pie on Sunday as a test run for the pie I will be making for Thanksgiving. I brought it to work so that I wouldn't eat the whole thing myself, lol, and it was a roaring success! I think I could have left the pie in just another 5 minutes or so because the crust seemed just a tad underdone, but it was flaky and buttery and delicious! Last night, I made the dough and refrigerated it so I can make the pie tonight for tomorrow's Thanksgiving dinner. The first time I made the crust, I had trouble keeping it together when I tried to form the disk, even though the dough formed when I pinched it. So, I added ice water as I brought it together. The same thing seemed to happen last night only it seemed a little worse than the first time. I plan on rolling the dough out tonight to make the pie. What do you suggest? Do I add water and need the dough a little tonight before rolling it out or should I just make a new crust? Your advice is very much appreciated!</p>

<p><em>If you are having a hard time holding it together, you might add just a little water to the dough.  I have found that even if the dough cracks as I roll it out, I can easily pinch the cracks together.  It's not neat and pretty, but as long as you can see lots of dots of butter in the dough you roll out you should have a flakey crust. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>Why is it not explained why the recipe uses unsalted butter and not the normal one. So many just say use this and that and don't explain why ! <br />
Hello maybe men don't know all the in's and out 's<br />
and need to be told. I am a pensioner and have a passion for baking and cooking, now that I have the time. Sorry ladies, My Mother never did explain either, when teaching her twin sons to cook.<br />
So please, explanation if you don't mind. </p>

<p><em>Hi George, it's a good idea to use unsalted butter in cooking or baking so that you can more precisely measure exactly how much added salt you want to put into a dish.  You should pretty much assume that any recipe calling for butter means unsalted butter for this reason. If you do use salted butter in a recipe, you will want to reduce the amount of added salt that recipe calls for. ~Elise</em></p>

		<p>Hi George:</p>

<p>The reason why you use unsalted butter instead of regular butter is simple. Regular butter makes the pie crust too salty. You can always substitute half of the salted butter with half shortening to reduce the salt content and make the crust fluffier.</p>
