<p>On Friday, I broke a tasty story about a woman suing Google, claiming bad directions caused her to get hit by a vehicle. Today, I discover our story is everywhere, often with no attribution. Come along and watch how the mainstream media, which often claims bloggers rip it off, does a little stealing of its own.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/woman-follows-google-maps-walking-directions-gets-hit-sues-43212">Woman  Follows Google Maps “Walking” Directions, Gets Hit, Sues</a> was the story I posted on Friday afternoon, Pacific Time. I was tipped to the lawsuit by Gary Price of <a href="http://www.resourceshelf.com/">ResourceShelf</a>. Gary hadn&#8217;t written about it himself but thought Search Engine Land would be interested in it. He came across it through the regular monitoring of search-related news that he does across a variety of resources (Gary watches many, many things &#8212; he&#8217;s a research guru extraordinaire). Gary downloaded a copy of the suit via the <a href="http://www.pacer.gov/">PACER</a> Service and sent it to me.</p>
<p>No one had written about the case before I put my article up. I know. I checked before publishing. There was nothing out there. So what happened next?</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ll Steal Your Image, But I Won&#8217;t Link To You</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the Daily Mail&#8217;s story <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1282926/Pedestrian-sues-Google-shes-knocked-walking-highway.html?ito=feeds-newsxml">here</a>. We get no attribution, but I know they found the story from us. My evidence? They&#8217;re using a screenshot I made, without my permission and without credit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a screenshot of the route from Google Maps. Sure, the Daily Mail could have generated their own route using Google Maps. But, they didn&#8217;t. &#8220;Their&#8221; image is cropped exactly the same as mine and includes an arrow I added to point to a warning on Google Maps.</p>
<p>Since the image was created by me, for Search Engine Land, and is a transformation of the original Google &#8220;work,&#8221; the copyright that the Daily Mail is violating belongs to Search Engine Land.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Postscript: </strong>There&#8217;s some debate in the comments on whether altering a Google screenshot as I did provides me with a copyright. Let&#8217;s say it doesn&#8217;t. That still doesn&#8217;t excuse the Daily Mail in my books for just taking the picture without any credit at all. Common courtesy still has a place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Financial Post <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2010/05/31/fp-tech-desk-woman-sues-google-after-walking-directions-led-onto-busy-highway/">does  the same thing</a>, uses my exact image &#8212; so they had to have seen my story &#8212; but they don&#8217;t bother to link over or provide attribution.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Postscript: </strong>Jameson Berkow from the Financial Post got in touch soon after I posted my story to apologize, saying there was originally a link to our article in his piece but which got lost along with other links through some technical glitch (which I can totally understand happening. I&#8217;ve lived through those myself). When he fixed the missing links, ours got overlooked accidentally but now has been restored. I&#8217;m also good with the usage of our illustration, since the article links over to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ll Link To Your Source Document, But Not You</strong></p>
<p>Over <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/197618/Google_Maps_Error.html">at PC World</a>, a different twist. Rather than link to my story, they linked to the source documentation &#8212; the lawsuit &#8212; that <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/32136379/Rosenberg-v-Harwood-Google">I uploaded</a> to my personal Scribd account.</p>
<p>I created this account on Friday, so it&#8217;s not something you&#8217;d just stumble upon in the course of independent news gathering. Maybe PC World saw someone else linking to it and so never saw my story.</p>
<p>Maybe. Then again, as part of the news reporting process, I think tracking down originating sources is important. Where did this document come from? The Scribd file links over to my original story. If you wanted to backtrack the origin of this document (say, perhaps, to know if it was actually real), you&#8217;d probably head over to my story.</p>
<p>Either PC World did this, and didn&#8217;t think credit was necessary, or it failed to fully fact check the story.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Postscript: </strong>PC World has added a link now, thanks, and the author <a href="http://daggle.com/mainstream-media-stole-news-story-credit-1906/comment-page-2#comment-23120">commented</a> about coming across my story after finding other ones about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>By Omission</strong><strong>, Someone Else Becomes The Source</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of how it happened, the PC World story is an example of something else, how a second party can become the originating source.</p>
<p>That PC World story? CBS News <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/06/01/tech/main6537604.shtml">cited it</a> as the source for its own story. That, again, makes you question some of the news reporting that is supposed to go on by the mainstream media. The reporting, that accounts often say, blogs themselves fail to do.</p>
<p>CBS simply seems to have summarized the PC World story, ending with a link to PC World plus a link to the complaint itself &#8212; the complaint I uploaded. Clearly no one tried to track down the complaint&#8217;s origin more. No apparent attempt to independently verify if the case was real. (FYI, unlike CBS, I actually did call the legal firm in the case on Friday).</p>
<p>That CBS story also flowed out to affiliated CBS news stations, such as <a href="http://wcbstv.com/technology/Google.directions.lawsuit.2.1726187.html">here</a> and <a href="http://cbs2.com/watercooler/Google.directions.lawsuit.2.1726187.html">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Postscript: </strong>CBS, after seeing this, added a link &#8212; thanks!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over at the <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/features/view/feature/Injured-Pedestrian-vs-Google-Maps-1342">Atlantic Wire</a>, PC World again gets cited, but not us. News.com also is cited in that Atlantic Wire round-up of commentary on the case. Despite the fact <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20006379-71.html">News.com prominently links to us</a> (thanks!), that doesn&#8217;t make it into the Atlantic&#8217;s story.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Postscript:</strong> They&#8217;ve since added a link, thanks!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/06/01/woman-sues-google-for-bad-directions/">Time Magazine</a> also does the same, linking to the Scribd document and the PC World story.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Postscript:</strong> They&#8217;ve since added a link, thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/lauren-rosenberg-sues-google-maps-over-walking-directions/19497640">AOL News</a> did similarly, linking to the complaint &#8212; which was almost certainly found by reading our story &#8212; but not to our story itself. As a result, places like the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tech_guide/2010/05/31/2010-05-31_lauren_rosenberg_sues_google_blames_faulty_google_maps_directions_after_being_hi.html">New  York Daily News</a>, <a href="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/technology/1062383/woman-hit-by-car-blames-google-maps">nineMSN</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/01/google_maps/">The Register</a> cite AOL News as the source.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Postscript:</strong> AOL has since added a link, thanks!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not just mainstream media that screwed up, however. Even <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5550982/woman-suing-google-over-walking-directions-that-got-her-hit-by-a-car">Gizmodo</a>, a well known tech blog, overlooked us. They linked to <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/05/29/if-google-told-you-to-jump-off-a-cliff-would-you/">Fortune</a>, which in turn linked to us. But we didn&#8217;t get a mention at Gizmodo.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Postscript: </strong>Originally I&#8217;d had written further below:</p>
<p><em>Semi-thanks to <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5550982/woman-suing-google-over-walking-directions-that-got-her-hit-by-a-car">Gizmodo</a>.  They linked to Fortune, which linked to us. But hey Gizmodo, next time,  show a brother-blog some love and give us a direct link.</em></p>
<p>It came up in comments that this was being too soft on Gizmodo, compared to some of the mainstream publications that I dinged for linking to an intermediary source. I agreed, <a href="http://daggle.com/mainstream-media-stole-news-story-credit-1906#comment-23085">explained why</a> this happened and have changed the story to ding them properly.</p>
<p>Having said that, about an hour after this story when live, Gizmodo added us as a source like this:</p>
<p>[<a href="http://searchengineland.com/woman-follows-google-maps-walking-directions-gets-hit-sues-43212">Search  Engine Land</a> via <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/05/29/if-google-told-you-to-jump-off-a-cliff-would-you/">Fortune</a>]</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve often seen them show the story trail across multiple sources this way, which I think is well done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Want to see attribution done right? <a href="http://www.inc.com/news/articles/2010/06/woman-sues-google-for-bad-directions.html">Over at Inc</a>, they appared to have spotted the PC World story first. But further down, there&#8217;s this:</p>
<blockquote><p>First reported by <a href="http://searchengineland.com/woman-follows-google-maps-walking-directions-gets-hit-sues-43212" target="_blank">SearchEngineLand</a></p>

<p><strong>The News, It Just Sprang From Our Forehead</strong></p>
<p>Though I&#8217;m a traditionally trained reporter, most of my journalism has been online, where documenting how a story has been found is both easily done (through links) and often done. Bloggers generally explain how they discovered a news item.</p>
<p>As a result, bloggers also set themselves up for accusations that they&#8217;ve just &#8220;ripped off&#8221; some traditional news outlet. By carefully listing an originating source, and sometimes a &#8220;via&#8221; source, they expose how news flows.</p>
<p>In contrast, a traditional media outlet typically does not document how a story came to life. It&#8217;s all a mystery. News just seems to emerge magically out of thin air in the middle of a newsroom. Or, it&#8217;s down to all those hard-working reporters out there defending democracy despite newspapers earning less these days because of all those rip-off bloggers.</p>
<p>For example, the Salt Lake Tribune <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_15199273">published</a> the Google Maps story yesterday, three days after our story went up. How did the paper discover the news?</p>
<blockquote><p>In a lawsuit filed last week  in U.S. District Court for Utah&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, lawsuits are public. Newspapers regularly check on them, in their areas. In fact, that&#8217;s exactly what Tribune reporter Chris Smart told me, when I called him today to ask about the origin of his story. Smart said the Tribune has a federal courts reporter who checks for filings each day.</p>
<p>I used to work for daily newspapers. I know courts reporters do this. But our story went up late on Friday afternoon Pacific time. How come the Tribune didn&#8217;t have its own story then? A full day had passed from when the case was filed to when it could have been written up. But it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Did the reporter come in on Saturday, Sunday or Monday &#8212; over a holiday weekend &#8212; and check the records?</p>
<p>There was some discussion between Chris and someone else in the newsroom, then I was handed over to the federal courts reporter herself. She eventually said that someone in the newsroom heard a rumor about this case, and she was called in to help locate it on Monday using the PACER system.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s imagine how the Tribune&#8217;s story would have looked, if that fact had been reported:</p>
<blockquote><p>After hearing a rumor about a case involving Google Maps, which someone saw on TV or read on a blog or we don&#8217;t really know where, we checked court records ourselves to find the case which says&#8230;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever rumor the Tribune heard, which finally got them to cover a story three days late in their own backyard, that rumor started with our story. Despite this, the Tribune became the originating source as cited by places such as  <a href="http://walking.about.com/b/2010/06/01/woman-sues-google-maps-over-walking-directions.htm">About.com</a>, the <a href="http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2010/05/31/daily3.html">San Francisco Business Times</a> and elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Postscript: </strong>The SF Business Times, after seeing this, kindly added a link!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond the Tribune, there are plenty of other places where the story was apparently just discovered out of the blue, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ksl.com/index.php?nid=148&amp;sid=10993315">KSL TV &amp; Newsradio</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dbtechno.com/curiosity/2010/06/01/woman-sues-google-after-getting-hit-by-passing-car/">DB  Techno</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.crn.com/mobile/225200661;jsessionid=2KAQL1SBDFG01QE1GHPCKH4ATMY32JVN">ChannelWeb</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/news/828670-pedestrian-sues-google-for-100-000-after-being-hit-by-car">Metro</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I especially like how this happens over at The Sun. The story <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2995305/Google-sued-over-crash-route.html">there</a>, by &#8220;Staff Reporter,&#8221; gives no clue about how a British tabloid owned by News Corporation came across a story that happened over 5,000 miles away. Wire report? Saw it on a blog? Is there a Sun reporter based in Park City, Utah?</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;ll Cite You, But Not Link To You</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.myfoxmemphis.com/dpps/news/lauren-rosenberg-sues-google-maps-after-being-struck-by-car-dpgoh-20100601-fc_7840945">Mashable</a> reported on our story, and like a reputable blog, they linked to us. But Mashable&#8217;s content appears to be syndicated into places like <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/google-lawsuit-woman-follows-directions-gets-run-over-20100601-wtrr.html">the  Sydney Morning Herald</a> &#8212; and our link got dropped in that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s bad for us, as we lose traffic. It&#8217;s also bad for Sydney Morning Herald readers, who may want to read our original story.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Postscript</strong>: They&#8217;ve since added a link, thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Related to this, both <a href="http://www.myfoxmemphis.com/dpps/news/lauren-rosenberg-sues-google-maps-after-being-struck-by-car-dpgoh-20100601-fc_7840945">Fox News Memphis</a> and <a href="http://www.myfoxla.com/dpps/news/lauren-rosenberg-sues-google-maps-after-being-struck-by-car-dpgoh-20100601-fc_7840945">Fox News LA</a> cite <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/05/30/google-maps-lawsuit/">Mashable</a> for their story, which makes me think all Fox News affiliates are sharing this piece. Since Mashable is credited, was it too hard to cite Search Engine Land as the original source?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Postscript</strong>: The story has since added a link, thanks!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Salt Lake Tribune also gets cited, which underscores a point I made earlier. Instead of original reporting going on, plenty of mainstream publications are happy to simply &#8220;echo chamber&#8221; a story that originated on a blog in the same way that blogs are often accused of doing to mainstream publications.</p>
<p><strong>And Now, It&#8217;s From The AP</strong></p>
<p>The Associated Press has filed on the story. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GOOGLE_SUED?SITE=CAACS&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">entire thing</a> so far (the story will no doubt grow as they do more reporting). I&#8217;m going to reprint the entire thing. I feel this is allowed by fair use, as it&#8217;s required to show the entire story in order to fully comment about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>PARK CITY, Utah     (AP) &#8212; A woman who says  she relied on Google for walking directions in Utah that got her hit on a  major roadway has filed a lawsuit against the Internet company claiming  it supplied unsafe directions.</p>
<p>Lauren  Rosenberg filed the $100,000 lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court in  Utah. It also names a motorist she says hit her.</p>

<p>As with the Tribune, where&#8217;s the information about how the AP discovered this story? Did the reporter come across someone else writing about it? If so, how about a credit? And if so, did they actually pull the case itself from PACER? Or did they download the document I put out there, like many others seem to have done?</p>
<p>Speaking of the Tribune, that paper is owned by MediaNewsGroup, which is led by Dean Singleton, who is also chairman of the Associated Press. Singleton and the AP <a href="http://searchengineland.com/ap-becomes-bad-cop-to-protect-news-from-misappropriation-17227">have been vocal</a> that blogs often rip them off for news content.</p>
<p>My <a href="../../do-newspapers-owe-google-fees-for-researching-stories-611">Do Newspapers Owe Google “Fair Share” Fees For  Researching Stories?</a> story has another example of a story that emerged from blogs and into the AP wire without attribution.</p>
<p>I think that if the AP or traditional publications like the Salt Lake Tribune documented exactly how they &#8220;found&#8221; news in the way blogs do, there&#8217;d be a fair reassessment of just how much flows back and forth. It&#8217;s not all a one way street, from traditional news outlets to blogs.</p>
<p><strong>Can&#8217;t We All Get Along?</strong></p>
<p>That brings me back to another piece I wrote last year, <a href="../../blogs-mainstream-media-we-can-do-get-along-344">Blogs &amp; Mainstream Media: We Can &amp; Do  Get Along</a>. I&#8217;d like to see a lot less finger-pointing and much more acknowledgment that the origin of news is a messy business.</p>
<p>So why am I pointing fingers in this case? To help keep things even. I think it&#8217;s very well known how traditional sources get cited by alternative ones. But while the opposite is true, that&#8217;s a story that&#8217;s rarely illustrated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also add that I know mistakes and misunderstandings can happen with attribution. I try to get it right, but I know I&#8217;m not perfect. I also know there are times we&#8217;ve reported on a story, credited someone else but nonetheless ended up as a originating source. News is messy. But we should all try to do better attribution.</p>
<p><strong>Postscript: </strong>Aside from the fairness of attribution, linking to sources brings those sources support with traffic. Our story at Search Engine Land has had 30,000 page views just from being mentioned in the Toronto Star&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/816724--woman-who-walked-onto-highway-sues-google-maps">write-up</a>. If other places like the Daily Mail or the Sun had linked, we&#8217;d have even more visitors, which is important to a relatively small publication. My <a href="http://searchengineland.com/thanks-for-the-link-mainstream-media-now-lets-have-more-10862">Thanks  For The Link, Mainstream Media — Now Let’s Have More!</a> post from 2007 has more thoughts on wanting to see more mainstream linking.</p>

<p>Really disappointing. Might be worthwhile to buy a domain and set it up to crowd-source an ongoing list of instances where this happens.</p>

<p>I understand your frustration but I think complaining about someone taking a Google screenshot is pushing it. The thing is, this story happened whether or not you reported it. Nobody has to credit you because you are not the story. I feel your pain, but you flagged up information in the public domain and other people used it too. There&#8217;s a limit to how much you can moan about that.</p>

<p>Also, re this:</p>

<p>Anne, they didn&#8217;t take a Google screenshot. Read the story again. They took a Google screenshot I had specifically modified. There&#8217;s plenty to &#8220;moan&#8221; about there. It&#8217;s a copyright violation, pure and simple.</p>
<p>I also addressed that the information is in the public domain. I understand news reports aren&#8217;t written to document how reporters come across the public domain info that they find. I&#8217;m also well aware of how traditional publications will routinely avoid crediting that they discovered news in a rival. I covered that in a previous piece that I mentioned:</p>
<p><a href="http://daggle.com/do-newspapers-owe-google-fees-for-researching-stories-611" rel="nofollow">http://daggle.com/do-newspapers-owe-google-fees-for-researching-stories-611</a></p>
<p>But the point is that you have a number of traditional publications complaining that bloggers are somehow ripping them off, that they somehow originate all the news out there (plenty of which is also in the public domain). They&#8217;re attracting the ear of people like the FTC seeking special protections:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2010/05/29/ftc-protects-journalisms-past/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buzzmachine.com/2010/05/29/ftc-protects-journalisms-past/</a></p>
<p>So this is less a moan and more, as I said at the end, a little illustration for balance in that debate.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Danny, most mainstream news consumers don&#8217;t care who scooped the story, they just want to hear the story. As long as that&#8217;s the case, the origin of the scoop will go undetected and scoopers will often (but not always) be overlooked.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your experience with mainstream media &#8220;borrowing&#8221; news from the blogosphere without proper credit and attribution.  It is ironic that MSM claim that blogs steal their content when they are actually mining cyberspace for stories to tell. In the echo chamber of news, I always appreciate knowing &#8220;who&#8217;s on first&#8221; and where the seed of a story sprouted.<br />

<p>Danny, I feel your pain. I&#8217;m not one of the &#8220;die, newspapers, die!&#8221; crowd, but the self-righteousness of the professional media about where their stories come from sometimes tempts me to join up with them. And as you know from your background, it&#8217;s an old joke that the local TV news would have nothing to run if they couldn&#8217;t read the newspapers in the morning. None of them have any shame.</p>
<p>I wrote a post about similar behavior (though of content with less original reporting than your own post) &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinrmathews.com/2010/03/17/why-are-people-so-willfully-stupid-about-how-news-gets-made/&quot; a couple of months ago. What the TV news guys do to newspapers, and what the newspapers did to you, lots and lots of reporters do to their shameful secret, the local PR guy or PIO.</p>

<p>Ben, I had thought about hosting the file directly, but sometimes there are issues with that on WordPress. I also wanted to try Scribd for the first time, to have the inline display. But I made sure to link over to our original article, figuring people would click over. Actually have to check the stats and see how many did!</p>
<p>Blake, yep, I understand many consumers don&#8217;t care. But that doesn&#8217;t mean news publishers don&#8217;t cite. Bloggers tend to cite mainstream sources more than those sources cite bloggers, that&#8217;s my gut feel. It&#8217;s something I hope begins to change.</p>
<p>Robb, I did a run through after I posted and fixed many typos about 5 minutes after the story went live. It&#8217;s often easier for me to spot if I push and profof. I&#8217;ll take another look. </p>
<p>I also understand that you often don&#8217;t hear radio reports giving a source. TV is the same way. In fact, newspapers are often irritated when their reports are used without credit in this way. But also, you sometimes don&#8217;t have the credit because if any publication uses a wire service such as the AP, they don&#8217;t have to often credit. </p>
<p>In cases of real scoops, you do often hear the Wall Street Journal or etc&#8230; is reporting. The key is that ANY news report should source where the information is coming from. If only the WSJ has the news, then you source that.</p>
<p>In this case, the news is public, it&#8217;s a public lawsuit. But clearly plenty of the publications I&#8217;ve cited didn&#8217;t actually read the lawsuit. They simply summarized what others were saying. Those who did read the suit &#8212; and linked to it &#8212; simply read a suit I uploaded, which could have been completely made up. That&#8217;s not reporting; that&#8217;s not citing a news source.</p>
<p>Vadim, Tamar, thanks.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t understand why Gizmodo gets a (semi)pass &#8211; is it because they aren&#8217;t traditional media?</p>
<p>&#8220;Semi-thanks to Gizmodo. They linked to Fortune, which linked to us. But hey Gizmodo, next time, show a brother-blog some love and give us a direct link.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are they not still guilty of the same thing the others are accused of &#8211; not linking directly to the source &#8211; especially when the source is referenced in what they are citing?</p>

<p>Danny,</p>
<p>The complaints from big media on how the &#8220;internet and blogs are stealing [their] business&#8221; are nothing short of ludicrous. </p>
<p>Techcrunch has also <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/13/youre-welcome-you-bastards/' rel="nofollow">written</a> about it.</p>
<p>What they [big media] have probably failed to realise is the very <a href='http://www.google.com/dictionary?q=hypertext&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=en|en' rel="nofollow">definition of &#8220;hypertext&#8221;</a>: <q cite='http://www.google.com/dictionary?q=hypertext&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=en|en'>&#8220;&#8230;a way of connecting pieces of text so that you can go quickly and directly from one to another&#8221;</q> and they continue about their business as if they were still only trying to sell newspapers on the local news stand. Yes, the news stand is still a market (even I prefer the hardcopy at times), but if they have any hope whatsoever of making it online they need to clear up what the world wide web actually <strong>is</strong> through a basic clarification of terms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s built into the very vocabulary of it &#8220;web&#8221;, &#8220;net&#8221; and, as I&#8217;ve already mentioned, &#8220;hypertext.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ricardo</p>
<p>PS &#8211; then again, they probably know these terms very well but refuse to acknowledge them.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Additionally, there have also been cases of them not fact-checking their stories (one that pops to mind is an April fool&#8217;s joke from Google this year &#8211; unfortunately I don&#8217;t recall the exact details nor the link &#8211; only that it was jumped on by one or two &#8220;reputable&#8221; news sites despite the fact that it was clearly an April Fool&#8217;s joke). </p>
<p>Despite this, they continue to complain (as you say) about bloggers stealing their content when they move like dinosaurs in a high-tech world. In some way, I feel they still hope to hold onto their &#8220;monopoly of information for profit&#8221;</p>

<p>Michelle, because when I started this piece, I was working through examples one-by-one, then toward the end realized there was a a better way to tell it and shifted my narrative to group things differently. </p>
<p>Gizmodo was a remaining outlier at the end that didn&#8217;t quite fit easily in how I restructred things, because I hadn&#8217;t mentioned Fortune already (as I did with PC World or News.com), so I was looking for a way to tuck them in as an example of a blog NOT getting it right. That&#8217;s where I stuck them.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t take it as praise to them. I thought it was kind of slamming them, actually. That&#8217;s why I made the intentional point of keeping them in. But maybe I&#8217;ll rework it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re taking the time to point all of this out. It&#8217;s about time that the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; media gets a taste of their own medicine, right? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m really not surprised at all, to be honest with you. There are a lot of other reports every single day that get filed as &#8220;articles&#8221; on mainstream sites that don&#8217;t get this treatment.</p>

<p>Interesting piece, and fun to think about.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a little bit rough to say the entire MSM stole this story, though. Although it may be of small consolation, after PC World, it seems that most American news outlets made at least a cursory effort to identify their respective tipsters. Determining the originator of a story adds value for readers, but I don&#8217;t think it adds a lot. </p>
<p>Of course, if PC World had acknowledged your blog, perhaps this entire episode would have gone differently. It is for that reason that I think the early involvement of the Daily Mail makes this a little less relevant as a case study.</p>
<p>If PC World first read about the case at the Daily Mail, the reporter essentially had to reverse engineer the story by finding case documents. I wouldn&#8217;t blame her at all for failing to attribute the Daily Mail.</p>

<p>&#8220;In contrast, a traditional media outlet typically does not document how a story came to life. It’s all a mystery. News just seems to emerge magically out of thin air in the middle of a newsroom. &#8221;</p>
<p>A few years back, I experimented with a format called &#8220;<a href="http://ilamont.blogspot.com/2008/11/source-blocks-get-boost.html" rel="nofollow">source blocks</a>&#8220;, and still use it today at the end of some of my blog posts to let readers know what sources I contacted or reviewed in the course of making the story. </p>
<p>A typical source block might look like this:</p>
<p><i>Sources cited, referenced, or consulted: Computerworld.com, Eatsleeppublish.com, an email from Jason Preston.</i></p>
<p>For longer or more thoroughly researched posts, there might be 10 or more individual items that are mentioned.</p>
<p>The idea behind source blocks is to improve transparency in a relatively lightweight manner (if you don&#8217;t include direct links, a typical source block takes less than a minute to manually create.) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the idea did not take hold, perhaps because it is an imperfect and manual process. However, with better tools (perhaps some sort of browser add-on) it might have a better chance of being used by bloggers, reporters, and others, and giving more credit to the sources of information that drive the news/discussions cycles.</p>

<p>Danny, I&#8217;m glad you documented this. I originally worked at United Press International &#8212; &#8220;yesterday&#8217;s news tomorrow&#8221;:&gt;) &#8212; and later at newspapers (which I hope to see survive, even though I&#8217;m now at a  non-profit journalism outlet called InvestigateWest). You should have been given credit and linked to by outlets that simply lifted your work and repackaged it. Those that did original reporting? I&#8217;m not so sure about those. It would be different if you&#8217;d done *lots* of reporting, but going on PACER and reading a suit that others can read, too? That&#8217;s arguable, I&#8217;d say.<br />
Let me also echo Robb Montgomery and thank you for fixing the typos. However, re-read your lede, man. I think what you want is &#8220;Come along and watch HOW the mainstream media,&#8221; etc., sted &#8220;Come along and watch OUT the mainstream media,&#8221; etc. (I&#8217;d have e-mailed you privately on the last point but couldn&#8217;t quickly find an e-mail address.)<br />
Keep up the good work,<br />

<p>Chris, agreed, I&#8217;m taking a broad license with the headline. The entire mainstream media didn&#8217;t steal the story. In fact, there are some examples of where they cited us clearly. </p>
<p>I also know its debatable whether anyone &#8220;steals&#8221; a story that&#8217;s coming off a public document. But to me, it&#8217;s not that hard for anyone who is days late in discovering the story to do a courtesy &#8220;as first reported by&#8221; type of thing. But I get why that doesn&#8217;t happen, for various reasons.</p>
<p>I think the Daily Mail is actually one of the worse situations. They don&#8217;t say at all how they discovered the story. I don&#8217;t know if they first read of it in PC World or any other source. There&#8217;s no way to tell. But I can tell they&#8217;re using my exact screenshot. To do that, someone almost certainly came to my site and grabbed it.</p>
<p>With PC World, since they linked to the document I posted, which is on my personal Scribd account with a link to my story, as I said, I feel like they should have been able to figure out where that document came from and source it appropriately.</p>
<p>I actually have server logs that can let me check for visits, but the difficulty is that a reporter might be only one of thousands who come &#8212; and not always will their &#8220;service provider&#8221; name match the publication they came from.</p>
<p>On May 31, I can see I had visits from places like Fox News, Cox Newspapers, Associated Newspapers (they publish the Daily Mail) and the Deseret News, among others.</p>

<p>Danny my friend, don&#8217;t get all crazy about it. Do you know how hard now day&#8217;s is to find THE source? I mean stuff get&#8217;s re-written 1000 times and everyone finds it&#8217;s &#8220;original source&#8221; from where they read about it. </p>
<p>Do you know how many stories I broke and in matter of seconds same stuff I read on other &#8220;top&#8221; sites? Sure some link, some don&#8217;t. </p>
<p>About your Google screenshot. Dude, ever heard of watermark? <img src='http://daggle.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Go to BGR (Boy Genius Report) and take one of their pictures without f**ing up the whole picture <img src='http://daggle.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  &#8230;.So next time , just put watermark on your picture if you think you are THE source. </p>
<p>By the way you used Google Maps and took snapshot , thats copyright right there <img src='http://daggle.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  </p>
<p>Ok enough about dumping sh** on you my friend. </p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s unfair from many that they didn&#8217;t give you some 15 minutes fame on TV and because you broke the story. Thing is reporters do go on site and check stuff out and they don&#8217;t have to credit others. Ever seen reporters up-front of your house? Like 50 of them writing same sh** just so NBC does not credit FOX or CNN <img src='http://daggle.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Listen, been blogging for 7 years now, been trying to write to people just like you did above, 2 hours later it&#8217;s going to get boring and you will probably forget about it within 48hours&#8230; So let me ask you&#8230;Are your nerves that much worth?</p>

<p>Agreed, Robert. My piece had stuff not in the case (I looked up the route, compared to the route instructions that Bing gave), but little to none of that was cited by other accounts. They&#8217;re all built around the case document itself. It&#8217;s just that it seems clear plenty of these source didn&#8217;t go to PACER to get the filing. They downloaded the case from my personal account on Scribd. The &#8220;reporting&#8221; in some cases seemed to be that they read the story on my site or heard about it through my site but didn&#8217;t do much legwork beyond that. So, I felt they deserve a few dings. I&#8217;ve seen worse, of course &#8212; one paper lifted an original quote from me, no attribution at all. But agreed, this is one folks can argue. And sorry on the typos. Got that fixed, too.</p>
<p>Joe, I&#8217;m not THAT bothered about the screenshot. Actually, I usually post them out to Flickr with an invitation that anyone can use them if they just link back. I was too busy to do so in this case. I&#8217;m mainly pointing it out to highlight that the Daily Mail clearly seems to have gotten the story from my site, completely with helping themselves to the image. A link would have been nice, but I&#8217;m not losing sleep over it. I&#8217;m not even livid with anger. More bemused. That&#8217;s just the way things tend to go. But in this particular case, it seems an interesting illustration to put out there and share.</p>

<p>Danny,<br />
In reviewing Daily Mail, it doesn&#8217;t appear that they give link credit to anyone, regardless of the story.  On images obtained elsewhere they don&#8217;t crop out the copyright but there is no way of knowing where it actually originated.  </p>
<p>If they don&#8217;t want to give specific credit, they just attribute the story to a catch-all Mail Foreign Service.</p>
<p>External footer links are nofollow as well.</p>
<p>Next time I hear a story like this I&#8217;ll think of this article and say they were &#8220;Daggled&#8221; and provide attribution of course:)</p>

<p>Sad to see this happens. It also goes to show how the chain is only as strong as the weakest link, in this case it was PCWorld and Daily Mail who seemed to have found the story on your site and chose not to link to you intentionally. Then it crumbles apart as the rest of the sites simply were too lazy to link to the real source, instead choosing to link to where they read about it.</p>
<p>In the end, its the big name sites that will get all of the credit, and traffic from a story which you spent time working on. Sorry that you got screwed Danny. If it&#8217;s worth anything, you have a fantastic site which I personally enjoy reading.</p>

<p>Oh I feel your pain. Just a few weeks ago I had two local news stations use my YouTube footage to illustrate a story. A story for them, but a problem in the city many people and neighbors and local gov. leadership were working hard on (prior to media coverage) trying to resolve in a timely manner. No attribution whatsoever. </p>
<p>Then one station even took their perception of their own magical media powers to a whole new level by loudly declaring in their promotional efforts that THEY alone had solved the entire city civil works project conundrum &#8211; singlehandedly. </p>

<p>I have the same EXACT problem every year, on a local level. I have an event site. It&#8217;s unique in scope and very popular this time of year. I go to a LOT of trouble to research the events, confirm them, write the descriptions. But every year the local Detroit newspaper and TV station websites swipe my events and publish them &#8211; with MY descriptions, mind you (and sometimes even my own CSS!!) without attribution. It&#8217;s plain out on my website that anyone can republish, as long as they give attribution and a link back.  I actually got a station manager on the phone who told me that once they take the events, it&#8217;s THEIR story, and there&#8217;s nothing &#8220;some little website&#8221; (which outranks them for the events) can do about it.  This one even had the nerve to complain that I wasn&#8217;t linking to her TV station&#8217;s website, and when I said how about the link back to me, she said no, we don&#8217;t know who you are, and we don&#8217;t have to link to you. But YOU should link to us.</p>
<p>Ugh, I get angry every time I think of it so I have to stop. It&#8217;s happened every year since about 2003 or so.</p>

<p>Danny,<br />
I&#8217;ve enjoyed following this story over the Holiday Weekend, particularly as I live in Park City! I RT&#8217;d your Tweet, wrote my own blog post about some additional thoughts I had about the case and then watched as the story appeared in the local media here in Utah (w/o any attribution of course).</p>
<p>This seems to be an interesting case study, particularly in light of a recent FTC draft on journalism, btw I highly recommend reading<a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2010/05/29/ftc-protects-journalisms-past/" rel="nofollow"> Jeff Jarvis&#8217;s excellent post</a> about it. In any event, I hope you continue to get appropriate credit for scooping a really interesting story, and where you don&#8217;t, at least you can always Google &#8216;em and then give &#8216;em Hell, good luck and keep it up!</p>

<p>This story points to so many failures of mainstream media that go far beyond not crediting your story, it&#8217;s just beyond sad. Not linking is a failure not only of transparency (as you suggest), but also of culture and technology.</p>
<p>To not recognize the value to readers of linking to external sources &#8212; of becoming a reader&#8217;s go-to source for not only the story, but all the supporting links exploring that story &#8212; is to not recognize the world outside your window. Anyone responsible for running a website should know and insist on as much linking as possible.</p>
<p>And as far as disappearing links go, that strikes me as a failure of technology (a feed importer, for example), that could easily be remedied by tossing whatever multi-million dollar infrastructure is presently in place, and replacing it with with a free copy of Wordpress or any other open-source CMS.</p>
<p>When you see this happening in real time like this, it&#8217;s difficult to not want to rip the whole industry apart and start over (which is happening anyway). </p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not even angry. I&#8217;d just like to get on with the future, already. <img src='http://daggle.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>Thanks for this, Danny. I agree it&#8217;s a textbook case and well documented. I spent 28 years in TV news before coming over to the force in 1998. I still work with mainstream media companies, so I&#8217;m painfully aware of all that you write about here. I have two comments. Firstly, the idea that TV news lifts everything from the morning paper is old news, and I don&#8217;t see it like I used to see it. Secondly, most journalists would rather die than admit the source for a story was some other form of media. The unwritten rule is that if you can find confirmation elsewhere, there&#8217;s no need to mention where you got the &#8220;idea.&#8221; Thankfully, the Web is changing this, and the currency of the link works both ways. Best wishes to you and thanks again.</p>

<p>Danny:</p>
<p>Annoying? Yes. Wrong? Certainly, for all the reasons you cite. New? Hardly.</p>
<p>I broke into the media business as a reporter for UPI, when it was the world&#8217;s second-largest wire service. We &#8212; at least, in our bureau &#8212; were pretty good about attribution, if only because we wanted to be able to blame someone else if the original story was wrong. (I have a long and entertaining story about this, but I&#8217;ll tell you over coffee in Seattle.)</p>
<p>But we would routinely find our enterprise stories &#8212; ones that took serious reporting &#8212; picked up without credit by major metropolitan newspapers or TV stations. (No internet then.) The capper would come when our brass would ask us to pick up, with credit, a story in the NYTimes &#8212; a story that we ourselves had originated two weeks previous.</p>
<p>This has been the life cycle of news stories since Ben Franklin: story in a small market outlet, picked up by a metropolitan paper, picked up by a national outlet, becomes media firestorm for two news cycles, then everyone forgets about it. The MSM eats its own, even other MSM. Gotta fill space, gotta fill time. Credit flows back downhill only in the rarest of circumstances.</p>
<p>Sorry. Sucks. At least you have a blog where you can talk about it.</p>

<p>You bring up an excellent point, Danny, and one that Andrew Keen has often pointed out, too. From his excellent book (Cult of the Amateur) to his blog.</p>
<p>And people have &#8220;ganked&#8221; the news over and over with false stories. But I would love to take the time to develop a whole site (maybe an entire copy of Search Engine Land &#8211; design wise) and called something similar &#8211; like Search Engine Landing &#8211; and then just post utterly false stuff. </p>
<p>Use Scribd and post false court documents. Use YouTube and post made-up videos of police brutality. Use your imagination. Sort of an &#8220;Onion News&#8221; with no humor. Just fake stuff. </p>
<p>And watch the news media eat it up. If the internet doesn&#8217;t disintegrate into a pile of electrons after that, I don&#8217;t know what will.</p>

<p>A few months ago I wrote a story for, let&#8217;s say, &#8220;a wire service such as the AP.&#8221; It was about an obscure person who had had basically no previous media coverage. In the few weeks after my story, suddenly all sorts of places that covered the relevant niche did their own stories on the person &#8211; of course following the unwritten rule mentioned by the previous poster that there&#8217;s no need to mention where they got the idea. </p>
<p>What is funny about this is that my first thought was &#8220;damn, I wish I had written the story for a website, at least there&#8217;d be a chance they&#8217;d link to my story.&#8221; </p>
<p>The grass always looks greener, huh? But it seems to me you&#8217;re not being treated this way because you&#8217;re a blogger &#8211; you&#8217;re being treated by the mainstream media just like it treats the mainstream media. The reason it seems wrong is that the web has a different culture about attribution which is more generous usually but not always: many websites took photos from my story and re-used them without any credit to the source &#8211; which was the blog of the person who was the subject of that story. There&#8217;s plenty of stealing going around &#8211; it&#8217;s hardly just MSM stealing from bloggers.</p>

<p>Thanks for helping to even the playing field for bloggers &#8211; one publication at a time. It is rare to see major media outlets on the defensive  adding citations to web based sources.</p>

<p>Danny, I saw your story balloon on techmeme.</p>
<p>Very interesting!</p>
<p>As others have mentioned, you should watermark your screenshots. Also, fair use of Google&#8217;s map in a snapshot for commentary (which the arrow definitely is) means you can use their copyrighted image. On the other hand, I don&#8217;t think you can copyright your fair usage of Google&#8217;s copyright. That&#8217;s why you should watermark.</p>
<p>Also, the thing for me with the ScribD account and PACER that no one else has caught is that the PACER system probably isn&#8217;t free &#8212; your buddy downloaded the document for you or you did with an account that costs money. So any media outlet that links to your ScribD account is accessing a file that they could get by trekking to Park City and paying for photo copies or by paying for a PACER account and paying for that.</p>
<p>So this story has an overhead cost that those who link but don&#8217;t attribute aren&#8217;t sharing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had this exact thing happen on numerous instances and I can&#8217;t tell you how frustrating it is (obviously you know because you&#8217;ve written this whole post).  It frustrates me significantly.  It makes me want to not link to mainstream publications when they do the exact same thing.  </p>
<p>I had someone take a breaking news article I wrote a few weeks back, share the article and they got over 50,000 visitors easily.  The writer has no contact information posted anywhere on the web.  I should have written a post like you did though.  Will do that in the future!</p>

<p>Hi Danny,</p>
<p>Dude, my bad.  By the time that I&#8217;d started writing about the story, it was blowing up the internet.  I sifted through a number of articles, but I didn&#8217;t come across Search Engine Land until after the story was already published (and even then, I wasn&#8217;t aware that you were the one who broke it).  I did find the link to the case filing on scribd from another site, not yours.</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this to our attention&#8211;I&#8217;ve contacted my editor and we have changed the article so that Search Engine Land is attributed in the story.  In the future, please feel free to send me or PC World an email if you have any issues.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

<p>Oh Danny&#8230;  Yup, you have been &#8220;dissed&#8221;&#8230;  But wait, it gets better!</p>
<p>A common &#8220;News Marketing&#8221; trick is to create cross-agreements in-between media outlets.  A newspaper has an agreement with one TV station for Weather, another for Sports, a talk-radio station for local news headlines, etc.  </p>
<p>Sometimes the money flows, sometimes it&#8217;s just cross promotion.  But it&#8217;s always incestuous.  Where EVERY story is referenced to the stories from the media outlets where cross-agreements are in place.  And nobody outside of a national newspaper or a network get&#8217;s credit for any story&#8230;  ever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rampant in local markets.  And since local reporters are now being told, trained, and edited in this regard when they make the larger regional or national media&#8230;  They not only don&#8217;t care how they cite..  They don&#8217;t care to the point that they only cite if it&#8217;s to their advantage.</p>

<p>I feel for you. When a CNET reporter once called us a &#8216;Tip Sheet Site&#8217;, I realized, this was adversarial. (She actually said that in front of about 5 bloggers on the show floor at SES SJ in about 05.)</p>

<p>You have one great fact: the law suit was filed and the general specifics of the suit. That gets you out of the first couple paragraphs. Everything else in the blog post is editorial in defense of Google.</p>

<p>Thanks for detailing some of the specific frustrations bloggers go through in terms of attribution. I know most of us are afraid to rock the boat or anger the sites and media outlets &#8220;above us&#8221; in the whole trickle-down credit system of today&#8217;s web, so complaints and finger-pointing episodes are few and far between. Hopefully the journalists and bloggers that read this article will actually start to consider the source as part of the story now instead of just something to be used internally and then thrown away when their article goes live.</p>

<p>Considering that mainstream media regurgitates story after story until it is drilled into our heads anyway, I get my news from the web, from bloggers and if I find a story interesting and want to know more about it, I follow links around and find out more.</p>
<p> I 100% agree both with your frustration and you underlying point, they are always accusing bloggers of doing exactly what they did to you. I have personally found independent writers (even with their opinions) to have the most valid and up to date versions of the news, often telling me the news that mainstream media either never mentions or mentions only in passing. Like the whole Corexit thing going on in the gulf, haven&#8217;t seen anything about it on tv but there is plenty about it on the web. </p>
<p>Anyway, I applaud you, thanks for speaking out and not just taking it.</p>

<p>As is the case in many businesses, the people who do the legwork in journalism often not only go unacknowledged but are entirely and quite intentionally ignored.  Forget fair compensation or a piece of the action that is their rightful due.  </p>
<p>While some third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth etc. party/corporation/plagiarist/thief eats the food off your plate.  And when you steal something, you can&#8217;t afford the common decency of leaving a trail of scraps for the people or persons who are in actuality putting food in your mouth.  No sense opening yourself up to that liability if you are not first required by law to do so, and you in fact know that someone has the evidence, resources, time and energy to in fact nail you. </p>
<p>If a law falls in a forest of broken laws and ethics and no one hears it break, was it in fact actually broken?  Apparently the answer is nah.</p>
<p>As the press squeeze gets tighter and tighter I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll see more and more of this, &#8220;I drink your milk shake&#8221; behavior.</p>

<p>Sarah, thanks for your comment and the change. Much appreciated.</p>
<p>Brett, jeez, you really seem to have a thing these days that I&#8217;m all about just defending Google. First you kind of ripped on me for fact-checking Bartz:</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/bartz-google-is-90-search-thats-a-fact-except-its-not-42766#comment-9985" rel="nofollow">http://searchengineland.com/bartz-google-is-90-search-thats-a-fact-except-its-not-42766#comment-9985</a></p>
<p>Now everything else in my original story was in defense of Google?</p>
<p>OK, I&#8217;ll bite. Keep in mind that at the time I wrote the story, there was nothing but the lawsuit. Neither Google nor Rosenberg&#8217;s lawyer were talking (and I tried reaching them both). So what have I got? That a woman searched for walking instructions, followed them apparently to the letter, got hit and decided Google was to blame.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m far from alone from finding that kind of crazy sounding. But it was an opinion piece in favor of Google? The first four paragraphs describe what happened, all factual. The next two show the route, point out there&#8217;s a warning &#8212; but also point out that on the BlackBerry, there might not be. Then I note that Bing, like Google also does the same route with the same warning. Google defense? Yeah, if you want to go with that. Me, I think it&#8217;s relevant to understand if Google was alone in being crazy routing her onto a highway or not. Apparently not.</p>
<p>I also showed pictures of the road and asked whether there was a place for common sense on whether to continue down a road or not. That seems reasonable to ask.</p>
<p>But then again, I also said the bad instructions by Google were &#8220;embarrassing,&#8221; that it makes its best guess in such situations which can be &#8220;laughable to annoying&#8221; and also said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here’s to Google improving its directions and perhaps using more common sense of its own, understanding whether a street is a busy highway and maybe simply not offering routes when it doubt, rather than guessing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Me, I thought that was pretty balanced. And as a matter of fact, when I finally did get to talk with her lawyer today, he found the questions completely reasonable as well &#8212; and admitted that his client shares some of the blame. The full story on that is here:</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/attorney-in-google-maps-lawsuit-43349" rel="nofollow">http://searchengineland.com/attorney-in-google-maps-lawsuit-43349</a></p>
<p>But hey, regardless of whether I think it was a news story or you think it was &#8220;I Love Google&#8221; opinion piece, the fact remains that the item broke this particular story to the world. Opinion piece or not, some credit would be nice &#8212; just as you&#8217;d like WebmasterWorld to be tipped when members express opinions about what they think is happening about something.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s often the case that blogs are such an accessible format that creating, maintaining &amp; owning a blog becomes a mission above &amp; beyond the art of researching &amp; reporting. many take from obvious or easy / well-known sites that remain obscure to their subsequent readership because they seem do well-served that they needn&#8217;t click through to reveal the chain or flow of a story&#8217;s origin. this is a two-way situation and it&#8217;s hard to tell who to blame most &#8211; reader or writer &#8211; but, ultimately, if information or knowledge is important then crediting at least the initial source for your article (better still the other &#8220;more complete&#8221; extensively-research articles on the same story) should benefit both your own writing and blog as well as the readerships knowledge.</p>

<p>Thank you Danny for this timely mini-expose of the <strike>meat packing</strike> quality press industry.</p>
<p>Just over a month ago, the Italian newspaper association <acronym title="Federazione Italiana Editori Giornal">Fieg</acronym> proposed a <a href="http://www.lastampa.it/_web/cmstp/tmplrubriche/tecnologia/grubrica.asp?ID_blog=30&amp;ID_articolo=7547" rel="nofollow">tax on internet connections</a> to subsidize the press.  This idea didn&#8217;t come out of the blue.  In Europe the music industry already benefits from a privileged tax on almost all storage media – CDs, DVDs, USB sticks, hard drives – even if the end use has nothing to do with copyrighted audio/visual media.  Legalized theft, as they say.  In Italy the government has historically subsidized the press through general taxes.  With new <a href="http://www.unita.it/news/94882/editoria_governo_conferma_i_tagli_colpo_al_cuore_allinformazione_libera" rel="nofollow">austerity measures</a> in the works, the traditional press is looking for a more politically acceptable tax to help pay its way &#8211; and Internet connections are a juicy target.</p>
<p>Now that we have clear proof as to how the <em>quality press</em> can, and do, rely on online media (sites, blogs etc) for original reporting, the clear absurdity of an Internet tax to help traditional media in their quest to distribute info sourced from the web should put an end to this initiative.</p>

<p>The story of the mainstream media:</p>
<p>1) Once a respectable and honoured institution;<br />
2) Dumbs down to gain a bigger audience;<br />
3) Bitches when they get beaten at their own game by bloggers;<br />
4) Left with nothing unique, but still want to charge for it;<br />
5) Steal from bloggers in a last-ditch attempt to look cool.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s time the media went back to what they once did best &#8211; truly original investigative journalism. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;d pay for, not &#8220;the best of Digg and reddit&#8221;.</p>

<p>As the journalist who broke this story I can&#8217;t help but feel you were a little naive as to how it would grow.<br />
Mainstream media rip off stories all the time and the only way to get around that is by selling the stories to them before you upload the copy to your site.<br />
As part of any deal you could then insist that online versions of the story link to your website.<br />
It will be a hard sell (especially on the link) but at least you&#8217;d be financially rewarded for your work.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s easy to blame the newspapers and &#8216;old media&#8217;, where a lot of these stories get picked up, especially outside of the US, is from freelance agencies selling them on as their own.  I&#8217;d be shocked if the Mail one didn&#8217;t come from an agency somewhere in England which had picked up the original story, rewritten it then sold it in as their own lead.</p>
<p>We get stuff all the time where agencies phone up trying to claim as their own stories we may have found ourselves online, or claiming exclusive UK distribution for stories which a quick Google search will reveal are already well established elsewhere.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t excuse the failure to attribute, but there will be many cases where the paper in question likely as not doesn&#8217;t even know there&#8217;s someone not being correctly credited for the tale.</p>

<p>Fascinating read. I actually saw this report on a Salt Lake local television&#8217;s website (of course, no attribution). </p>
<p>As an independent writer/blogger/journalist myself, in the video games industry, I see this happen all the time. It actually becomes an outright war between sites at times, and some sites are notorious for not crediting the source. It all comes down to self-policing at a few social media outlets where they all meet together to share news and &#8220;break&#8221; stories.</p>
<p>You think that, in a world of time stamps and technical logs, we&#8217;d have a little more rights as the independent fellow to say &#8220;Hey, I said that first, give me a little credit.&#8221; But no, comment #2 hits it right on the head.</p>

<p>I am sad that this has happened to you and am glad you have documented it in such a detailed way but given your experience are you really surprised?  The idea of a domain name to document when this happened would need a full time team of double figures, it is standard practice and will only get worse as more people decide to broadcast their views.</p>
<p>Small companies with little in the way of resources are not going to put up much of a fight against media behemoths and they&#8217;re counting on that.  Large media companies are also extremely lazy, relying virtually entirely on AP or whichever news agency they use to provide copy.</p>
<p>Once something is out on the net, it would be great if there was an &#8220;Original Source&#8221; that links back to the first post of the story but that relies on all media outlets signing up, or very good news aggregators.</p>
<p>Your post points out a number of ways news companies avoid attributing the little guy, a post I made at <a href="http://blogging4jobs.com/social-media/when-your-blog-is-my-content" rel="nofollow">http://blogging4jobs.com/social-media/when-your-blog-is-my-content</a> continues the theme.  Once something is in the public domain, news companies will pretend the original story didn&#8217;t exist and they &#8220;break&#8221; it days later by using public records and/or quotes &#8211; quotes are fantastic as they make stories more personable but also once they are broadcast somewhere, other companies will use them for their own devices.</p>
<p>The problem with all this to combat the theft of stories, organisations go down the route of hammering home to their audience that their story is &#8220;Exclusive&#8221;.  Which ends up devaluing the exclusive tag.</p>
<p>As more ways to broadcast are created, depressingly I can only see the problem exacerbating.  It doesn&#8217;t matter if it is a journalist, a blogger, whatever, it&#8217;s already standard practice in the journalism world so if anything bloggers can raise that standard.</p>
<p>Watermarking and the Control C app that&#8217;s due out where you can track who has copy and pasted your work will be making a few people out there very concerned.</p>
<p>As news agencies cut back more and more on journalistic staff and the ones that are left are forced to contribute every increasing quantities of copy, again I can only see copy theft rising.  I wasn&#8217;t a journalist in the good old days but I&#8217;m fairly certain writing 10-15 articles a day wasn&#8217;t the norm then.</p>

<p>I think this happens more than people think and it is worth pointing out the hypocrisy. I&#8217;ve had screenshots/photos taken without attribution and in one case had a big tv channel use an entire video for b-roll. Not only did they not ask permission or credit the company I was with at the time, but they cropped our logo out of the video.  It is the hypocrisy that bugs me the most, because when the tables are turned media companies attack with lawyers.</p>

<p>You are my hero. It drives me nuts to no end that supposedly reputable news sources repeat information and don&#8217;t credit. I&#8217;ve seen MISTAKES sweep across the net. This also happens in print, so no surprises really. It&#8217;s time force these lazy journalists to be honest. The journalism profession, which has taken a dive, should be restored. I consider this job as important as a doctor&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Bravo for you for exposing this. I like the way you reported it all in-depth. I don&#8217;t think the fight here is new vs. traditional media. It&#8217;s a simple matter of ethics and not doing what&#8217;s easy. As a journalist who has worked in broadcast and print I know firsthand how news organizations (particularly newspapers) have treated the idea of linking to other sources. It seems as though they underestimated you in this case. At some point it&#8217;s about common decency, nothing more. Where is that in all of this. TV stations have long combed newspapers for stories that are never attributed. The thinking there is you get your own sources and it becomes yours. I&#8217;m not saying this is right, it is just a long held tradition that absolutely needs to be challenged. People are always scoffing at Arianna Huffington for her belief in the link economy, but this is real. Your link is your currency online, and you were ripped off. Again, love the way you brought it to life. </p>

<p>first, though I write often for pcworld (and find much of my other writing syndicated there from other IDG sites), I did not write the story you&#8217;re complaining about. but looking at it now, I see a very clear mention of search engine land and a link in graph #4 of sarah jacobsson&#8217;s story. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if that was missing from the original story and was added later (there&#8217;s no note to that effect), but the pub date on it is 7 am, 31 may &#8211; prior to your blog entry, danny. so I have to ask, why are you taking pcw to the woodshed and not offering an update noting this?</p>
<p>at the very least, if sarah found your story and wrote her own version of it w/o attribution, then pcw realized its mistake and corrected it. why do<br />
CBS, the FT, and Gizmodo get the shoutout, but not pcw?</p>
<p>I suspect in this case that because what you were reporting on is in the public record &#8212; not really an original story that no one else could have written w/o your efforts, certainly not investigative &#8212; other pubs felt less beholden to site your original. that&#8217;s just speculation on my part, of course. </p>
<p>the mainstream media is now doing what blogs have done for years &#8212; piggyback on someone else&#8217;s reporting. but you fail to get at the reasons why this happened, and why pcw was cited first by other sources. it&#8217;s because of how Google News operates. I&#8217;ll bet the reason these other sources cited pcw or CNET is because GN happens to love those sources big time. they are always on the front page, regardless of who broke the story. and reporters/bloggers, working on a frantic schedule to put out stories, saw them and ran with it. </p>
<p>I think your issue is with Google News, which I&#8217;ve been saying for a long time is seriously broken and needs to be fixed. the question you should be exploring here is not &#8216;why did those mean mainstream reporters steal my story and not credit me,&#8217; it&#8217;s &#8216;why didn&#8217;t Google News credit my story as the original one and drive the traffic to me?&#8217; that&#8217;s the far bigger question, I think, and the one a person who runs Search Engine Land is really in the best position to answer. </p>

<p>As a reader it is a pain to try and find the original source of stories on the web today.  Very few sites provide original content or even links to the original content.  A real pain.  The legacy media is one of the worst in this regard.  Hopefully they will get better as the move into the digital age.

<p>&gt; defense of google</p>
<p>Right now, Google maps is under strong pressure and 3 fronts:</p>
<p>o The issue with Google illegally WiFi sniffing in Europe with the Germans made major headlines. Google admitted to possible serial violations of German law.<br />
o The issues with street mapping in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.<br />
o Google sued over street view: <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2008/04/05/google_sued_over_street_view/" rel="nofollow">http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2008/04/05/google_sued_over_street_view/</a><br />
o Also a back burner issue with the accuracy (lack thereof) of Google Maps since Google switched data providers from NAVTEQ to Tele Atlas.<br />
<a href="http://www.gpsreview.net/google-tele-atlas-five-years/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gpsreview.net/google-tele-atlas-five-years/</a></p>
<p>Look through the blogosphere, there are people all over that have been commenting on how bad Tele Atlas data is: <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/maps/thread?tid=3e7d5f2f2eedaf07&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/maps/thread?tid=3e7d5f2f2eedaf07&amp;hl=en</a></p>
<p>Those are three issues that should be part of any story on Google Maps. All 3 bear strong influence on this case. (especially the legal issues)</p>
<p>Instead, we get an OpEd piece where it is popular to hassle the frivolous law suit. I don&#8217;t really have an opinion about the case other than Google needs to improve the accuracy of Maps. Navteq data was so much better.</p>
<p>I just remember when that lady sued mickyd&#8217;s because she was &#8220;burned with coffee&#8221;. Everyone from John Q to Leno love to slam her as a gold digger. It turned out the coffee maker may have had a broken thermostat and the manager had received complaints about it. (btw: she won the suite against a major corporate power).</p>
<p>Who knows, in this case the woman may have had strong reason to believe you could walk where she did based on Google&#8217;s Map recommendation. Either way, I don&#8217;t think you can cover this story without talking about Google maps, accuracy, and the big issues Google Maps is currently facing. To not cover them is a gross oversight, or intentional.</p>

<p>This happens to me pretty much every time I break a story in my Wi-Fi blog (which has been a while, but Wi-Fi used to be sexier). I&#8217;d write it up, and within a few hours to days, I&#8217;d see stories in mainstream media not referencing the original. I broke when Cometa was closing down by following up a tip and calling the company. Thousands of stories ran about it (because AT&amp;T, IBM, and Intel were involved in the venture), and only a handful mentioned that they had gotten the story from me.</p>
<p>When I wrote about a coffeeshop that shut down its Wi-Fi on weekends a few years ago, the Financial Times and NPR picked up the story &#8212; literally, called the same cafe, and I was the only lead &#8212; without crediting me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just endemic. Reporters need to justify having original stories, and it&#8217;s not in their interest to alert editors of the source as long as they do original reporting and don&#8217;t simply quote the original story. That&#8217;s plagiarism, but you make a couple of calls and read a couple of source documents, and suddenly, it&#8217;s a new story.</p>

<p>Bottom line is, traditional media often doesn&#8217;t think it needs to credit sources it doesn&#8217;t feel are truly &#8216;news media&#8217;. I see it happen all the time to bloggers and content creation sites that are &#8216;new&#8217; media. But it&#8217;s not the only place they take copy &#8211; I can&#8217;t tell you how many times a newspaper has taken one of my press releases verbatim, slapped a byline on it and claimed copyright for the story. As a PR person, that just makes my job easier. But if I was blogging about it, I sure as heck would want the credit (and would spend as much time as you did making sure it happened.) Way to go!</p>

<p>Brett, I disagree that any time you write a story about Google Maps, you need to mention the WiFi sniffing, lawsuits over Street View photography or that Google has shifted over to NAVTEQ lest you be guilty of a gross oversight or intentionally working to defend Google.</p>
<p>You mention things in an article that are relevant. In my article, I mentioned that instructions clearly weren&#8217;t providing decent walking directions as promised and cited two other examples of Google Maps giving really bad directions.</p>
<p>In terms of the WiFi issue, we&#8217;ve covered that plenty, including:</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-stops-wifi-collecting-street-view-cars-after-privacy-concerns-42120" rel="nofollow">http://searchengineland.com/google-stops-wifi-collecting-street-view-cars-after-privacy-concerns-42120</a><br />
<a href="http://searchengineland.com/sergey-brin-we-screwed-up-42386" rel="nofollow">http://searchengineland.com/sergey-brin-we-screwed-up-42386</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll keep mentioning it as part of stories where it is relevant.</p>
<p>In terms of Street View photography, Google has issues with that not just in Europe (which includes the UK) but all over the world. They&#8217;ve been sued in some places; they&#8217;ve been challenged on privacy grounds in others. They&#8217;ve also been supported in some cases (such as by the UK&#8217;s privacy authority). Covering Street View is more than pointing to one single article, since there&#8217;s so much upset about it.</p>
<p>As for TeleAtlas, you&#8217;re confused. Google stopped using them in October in the US. We had a hunking huge analysis about it:</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/tectonic-shifts-altering-the-terrain-at-google-maps-27783" rel="nofollow">http://searchengineland.com/tectonic-shifts-altering-the-terrain-at-google-maps-27783</a></p>
<p>They also stopped using them in Canada in April:</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-making-changes-to-canada-maps-now-owns-the-data-as-in-us-40984" rel="nofollow">http://searchengineland.com/google-making-changes-to-canada-maps-now-owns-the-data-as-in-us-40984</a></p>
<p>If the shift to using its own data caused the bad directions, that might be relevant to add to the story. But since the accident happened in January 2009, before the data was changed, it doesn&#8217;t seem relevant.</p>

<p>Heh, it started with the Daily Mail, did it? They once hotlinked to a picture I mocked up, without giving any credit or acknowledgement. It&#8217;s not like they didn&#8217;t know where it came from, since they were linking to where I had hosted it.</p>

<p>Dan, because I saw Sarah&#8217;s comment on my phone late last night and wasn&#8217;t in a position to add an update then. That&#8217;s all. As people have told me of changes, I&#8217;ve been adding notes. I&#8217;ll get to it shortly.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, I know this is a story of public record. Some publications may feel like they don&#8217;t have to credit the source that broke the story at all, because of that. Some might honestly get confused over who broke it. As more time goes on, and as more and more publications write about it, that gets harder. It also gets silly to complain about. A month from now, do you expect anyone to write about this to say &#8220;first reported by&#8230;.&#8221; I certainly wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll stress again that I&#8217;m not livid with anger or anything like that. I&#8217;ve been writing on the internet for nearly 15 years now. Nothing I&#8217;ve described above is new or unexpected to me. It was just a nice, clear example where publications could have given a shout-out but didn&#8217;t, and I though it made a nice illustration during a time when we have many vocal editors and publishers of mainstream publications playing the victim card against online journalists. Editors, and publishers, are important in all this. The journalists on the line often do want to attribute things, but you can have an old guard that doesn&#8217;t believe in it or finds it a waste of time.</p>
<p>As for Google News, you&#8217;re right. I could have, and perhaps should have, done an entire thing on what a mess they were. I&#8217;d do a search, and I&#8217;d come up with a ton of little tiny stories way above mine, no attribution, no great info and from odd sounding places.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s actually the opposite of what you&#8217;re talking about. Right now, in a search for Lauren Rosenberg, it&#8217;s not the little stories that are top. It&#8217;s PC World, followed by the LA Times. Then I get Top Tech News, which is really the AP story, which isn&#8217;t supposed to happen because Google carries its own AP stories and should point at them. Then I get &#8220;Island Crisis,&#8221; which provides &#8220;Mauritius News&#8221; along with tech news. That&#8217;s one of Google&#8217;s top picks?</p>
<p>If I shift to a search for just &#8220;Google Maps,&#8221; PC World is still there, along with a four paragraph story from Woman&#8217;s Day, then the Guardian.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a real mixture of big and small that they pick, but I&#8217;d agree that what they pick doesn&#8217;t appear to be among the most authoritative or most cited stories. That&#8217;s definitely a contributing factor for anyone who really wants to cite an original source &#8212; though I have to say, I deal with that all the time when I&#8217;m looking for who to cite and yet I can still often find the right place. But I run my own publication &#8212; I don&#8217;t have an editor who might accuse me of wasting time.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;d already spent enough time &#8212; more time than I&#8217;d planned &#8212; writing about the source attribution, so I didn&#8217;t get into the Google News stuff &#8212; which would also involve having a look at Yahoo News, and what was happening there. But look at this:</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-news-ranking-stories-30424" rel="nofollow">http://searchengineland.com/google-news-ranking-stories-30424</a></p>
<p>It was a long look at Google News ranking issues that I did last year, and how it can be confusing. And this:</p>
<p><a href="http://searchengineland.com/josh-cohen-of-google-news-on-paywalls-partnerships-working-with-publishers-29881" rel="nofollow">http://searchengineland.com/josh-cohen-of-google-news-on-paywalls-partnerships-working-with-publishers-29881</a></p>
<p>Covers issues with surfacing the authoritative story, in cases when there are those, which has especially been a key issue for the AP. Of course, the AP could largely solve its particular issue if it actually published a single article and didn&#8217;t yank it down after 30 days. But as a wire service, it is in a complicated situation.</p>

<p>News stories are like children: at a certain point, they grow beyond you and take on a life of their own. The first layer of sites that picked up your story should certainly have cited you and linked back to you. But expecting the Associated Press to cite the source of every story *that involves a matter of public record* after it&#8217;s been reported by dozens or hundreds of other outlets is just silly. Yes, you got a nice little scoop that&#8217;s a big talker. Pat yourself on the back. But don&#8217;t expect every outlet or website who picks up the story to say &#8220;&#8230; as reported by the amazing Danny Sullivan, and kudos to him!&#8221;</p>
<p>I recently broke a story that involved photos that were supplied to me, and only to me, by a third party. I deliberately didn&#8217;t watermark the images when I posted them online, but I did alter them in a subtle way so that I&#8217;d know when they were cribbed and used on other sites. Dozens of sites took the photos and used them without attribution. Was I annoyed? No. They weren&#8217;t my original photographs, and with a little work these sites could have eventually obtained their own copies. My ego is not so large that I need everyone who uses my ideas to credit them to me. A simple Google search will show I broke the story first, and that&#8217;s all that matters.</p>
<p>Frankly, most readers don&#8217;t care who found the body in the woods, they just care that a body was found in the woods. Let your children go and take satisfaction in the fact you raised them well, even if they don&#8217;t always tell people how great their parents are.</p>

<p>The mainstream outlets probably assumed you borrowed the story yourself since your site (&#8220;Search Engline Land!&#8221;) looks exactly like a poorly-designed spamblog that churns out robo-acquired material from other news sites.

<p>I&#8217;ve seen spamblogs, Andy. We don&#8217;t look like one. Sorry you disagree.</p>
<p>The mainstream press also disagrees, by the way. There are been plenty of cases where the site or individual editors have been cited by publications such as the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. We&#8217;ve been respectable enough for them.</p>

<p>Hmmm&#8230;.questionable ethics in not identifying a source of the screen shot, but I&#8217;m not entirely sure that you can claim copyright for modifying a Google map and making a permanent image of it. It is, after all, Google&#8217;s map and programming.  Interesting question, though. In other news, welcome to how news gets reported. Back when I was a journalism student working for college papers, the AP and other &#8220;professional&#8221; news organizations ripped off our stories (using them as a template to do their own) all the time.</p>

<p>I see a lot of comments saying, &#8220;What&#8217;s the problem? It&#8217;s only a story!&#8221; and it kind of makes me sad. Apparently none of these people understand that a writer works hard on their pieces &#8212; whether fiction or journalism &#8212; and that, while we love to share, we also want credit where credit is due. A newspaper would freak out if its content was being used without being cited or linked to &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen it; I work for a newspaper &#8212; but many often care little about the blogs they get content from.</p>
<p>Thanks, Danny, for standing up and saying something.</p>

<p>I understand the frustration you must feel, but I take issue with the notion that you have some sort of exclusive right to information. While you may have broken the original story and in the process scooped major news media, that doesn&#8217;t give you some interminable right to be linked back to. What is important, however, is that those writing stories about this independently verify the claims you make and don&#8217;t just use you as their source. It would be very lazy journalism indeed were they to simply parrot your news.</p>
<p>Simply, public information is public information, and it really doesn&#8217;t matter who uncovers it, who finds it, who stumbles across it when such a person don&#8217;t hold copyright to the information. This was never your information.</p>
<p>Still, congratulations on breaking the story and uncovering the information yourself. There&#8217;s something to be said for that, and I don&#8217;t mean to belittle any work you may have done.</p>

<p>Matthew, I never said I had an exclusive right to the information. I&#8217;ve addressed that yes, this is public information, and there&#8217;s no particular reason people have to link. But it would be courteous, at the very least, and it&#8217;s something commonly done in the blogging world but not so much in the mainstream world.</p>
<p>Also, it sounds like you&#8217;ve missed a key point. Many sources linked to the lawsuit that I uploaded &#8212; which implies they read the information I provided, rather than seek it themselves (and independently verify it was a real case). That is lazy journalism, and if they&#8217;re going to parrot a legal document I put out in the public domain, then attributing where it came from is even more important.</p>

<p>Danny,</p>
<p>I agree, there is a problem in linking to your source for the lawsuit, but as it&#8217;s in the public domain — as a document, and not as a result of your placing it there, there&#8217;s not much that can be done. I also agree that it&#8217;s lazy journalism to not independently verify the document, and, indeed, it can have very sincere consequences, particularly in the realm of document forgery.</p>
<p>It seems an implicit claim you&#8217;re making, and I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve made it explicit. By making this post and following it so heavily, you&#8217;ve made it quite clear that you are concerned that people have not performed what you describe as a courtesy; thus, I hypothesize, perhaps wrongly, that you are concerned about something more than simple courtesy.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

Thinking of dropping your link spam? Consider this. Seriously, STOP & READ. The guy who runs Google's spam fighting team? I know him pretty well. In fact, it's sort of a joke between us to see what's the latest absurd link drop I can share. So if you want your site to be a poster child on his idiots wall -- and probably to encounter a Google penalty -- go ahead, drop your link. It's nofollow anyway, plus I do have built-in spam fighting and what gets past that usually gets nabbed in a few minutes to a few hours. So you got to ask yourself. Are you feeling lucky?
